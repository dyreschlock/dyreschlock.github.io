| February 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday we watched one of my favorite movies..  <b>War of the Worlds</b>.  Man i love this movie.  That 2005 Friday evening was a very magic evening.  Nature truly applauded the release with a lightning storm of its own.  That summer i went to the theaters a total of 3 times to see it.  Later on, i downloaded it from the internet and watched it quite a bit more.</p><p>I hadn't seen it in a while, so i needed my fix.  War of the Worlds falls into the same category as other great films like Matrix Reloaded, where the movie itself is very shallow.  It won't win any awards, but there are many aspects of the movie that are rich in substance.</p><p>I really seem to like these movies.  They appeal to my manic adrenaline side, but still offer more than that outside of the film.  I think that's why i don't really like Crank all that much.  There's really nothing there..</p><p>One of the things i noticed about War of the Worlds were the death machine designs compared to the alien design.  The aliens themselves, are 3 legged creatures with 3 fingers on each hand.  They can also walk on walls, which suggests the tip of their fingers have suction cups or something like that.  Their torso's are quite small compared to their leg span.  They have tiny little arms, and their heads fan out kinda like a spoiler.</p><p>The death machines can be described in the exact same way.  3-legged machines with tiny bodies.  Small little arm instruments on that body with a fanned out head..  So these alien death machines are actually alien mecha, machines built in their creator's own image.  Much like how anime such as Gundam model their massive machine after the human body.  It interesting to see a alien race so bent on vengence and rage would adopt one of our most arrogant traits.  It's quite... human.</p><p>When i was in Japan, #five and i got onto this subject somehow and he was telling me about an article some guy wrote about the movie.  It dealt with the time periods in which these movies were made.  For the original War of the Worlds books and movies, it was always about the aliens coming to air.  Flying their air ships from the sky, and zapping all the humans.  All those remakes came at a time when war was waged between countries.  The threat was always external.  Fear of invasion.</p><p>In the new War of the Worlds, the aliens were always here.  Underneath us..  biding their time.  They didn't come from the outside.  This parallels the wars that are waged today.  The war with terrorism.  The threat isn't external: it is internal.</p><p>This really makes the 2005 War of the Worlds an <em>adaption</em>, not a remake. ^_^</p><p>____</p><p>Anywho, this movie is all manor of kick ass, so if you haven't seen it you must.  I was rather surprised that one of my roommates hadn't even heard of it..  That was actually the real reason behind watching it.</p><p>A while ago, i developed the War of the Worlds drinking game which is both simple and works quite well.  All you have to do is take a drink when:</p><p>1) Someone asks an unanswered question.</p><p>That's it.  It worked quite well on Niehaus the first night he decided to drink.  I've got pictures hidden around this site if you're interested ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shining" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shining">Shining</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A cold and soft blanket of what the night would be.  After buying some delicious groceries, the blanket thickened as visability dimmed.</p><p>The previous snowfall had already begun to melt from the warmth of the past few days.  the beautiful white hills sported patches of unsightly brown.</p><p>After making dinner, my roommates gathered their things.  They were to house sit for the weekend.  A virtual mansion out in the countryside.  The animals needed feeding, so this was their task.  They asked me to join them, and hell...  I wasn't going to stay behind alone.</p><p>Outside was whitening.  A new cover of snow with plenty more falling from the sky.  Inside the car we puttered along the highway far slower than the limit.  An hour later, we reached our destination in the white wilderness.  Our tracks were covered behind us.  Its as if there was nothing out there.  Like we traveled  into the heart of white darkness with a warm lonely mansion at its center.  We piled out of the car, and sought refuge inside.  The car disappeared in snow as we moved to the doorsteps.</p><p>Inside we could only see white snow cover.</p><p>whoooo.  party!  thank god we brought about 100 beers with.  we played cards and built a fire and fell asleep.</p><p>The morning came and white light crept into the room bit by bit.  It had stopped snowing at some point through the night, but it is forcasted to add another equal layer.</p><p>so, we're here..  in the white wilderness, feeding their animals and listening to the radio.</p><p>I wonder who's gonna go crazy with the axe first.</p><p>anywho..

| February 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As indicated by the previous articles, a couple of weeks ago i purchased a Wii.  A thread on Cheap Ass Gamer stated that Wal*mart was holding on their shipment of Wii to be released on that coming Sunday.  So, that sunday, i woke up at stupid o'clock in the morning, put on my jacket and drove over to Wal*mart.  It was only 5 minutes away from my house anyways.</p><p>I got their 15 minutes before they opened, and received the number 17 to indicate my place in line.  Apparently, this was more well known than i thought.  They had plenty of Wii machines to go around, though.  I got home and went back to bed for a little while.  Later on that day, we hooked it up and started messing around with Wii Sports, but got bored of it.  I wanted something fun to play that took advantage of the Wii-mote's capabilities.</p><p>I went out and picked up Trauma Center as my first Wii title.  I thought this was rather nostalgic since Trauma Center was also the first title i purchased for my DS.  I got home, put it in, and started to play.</p><p>For some reason, i thought this was a brand new game.  Since the full title of the game is "Trauma Center: Second Opinion", i thought that meant this was Trauma Center 2.  They couldn't really make a sequel of Trauma Center DS, but they could've had more doctors in other parts of the Trauma Center universe.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trauma Center Wii is a port of the DS title.  The story, characters and surgeries are the same fun missions you tackled on the portable venue.  How disappointing..</p><p>They did add another character at the last minute.  When you complete a story arc, you unlock another story with another character.  These missions take full advantage of the Wii controller.  In the first mission, you twist the Wii-mote to place a shattered broken bone back together.</p><p>On its' own, Trauma Center really starves the player.  The gameplay really lends itself to an Arcade setting, but the bulk of time spent in game is reading character dialogue.  The player sits through boring text until they finally get to experience the action and fast-paced setting of the surgery gameplay.  As far as i know, you can't skip this dialogue..  i should look into that.  Unfortunately, if they removed all story and just had a bunch of surgeries, the game wouldn't have any depth.</p><p>The gameplay is where Trauma Center really shines.  You have several different tools that you switch back and forth through while performing the surgery as outlined in the dialogue.</p><p>I'm not really sure which version of Trauma Center i prefer.  In the DS version, you have the extra precision of pinpoint pen strokes on the touch screen, but with the Wii version you have the speed and agility of an extra controller to switch between instruments.</p><p>There are other little differences as well.  On the Wii version, you actually use the defibrillators rather than the nurse automatically doing it for you.  Using the healing touch i've found to be much more difficult, but i think i just need to get used to the timing.</p><p>Anywho, i do love Trauma Center, but there are many downfalls that make it difficult to recommend to people.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-3">Twilight Princess (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, i finally came across Twilight Princess on the Wii for a cheapy price tag, so i picked it up.  Thinking back, i'm not really sure why.  In the past two months i've started 6 games that i have not finished.  These games would be Portrait of Ruin on DS, Final Fantasy XII on PS2, Cooking Mama on DS, Hotel Dusk on DS, Trauma Center on Wii, and Picross DS on DS.  I've been playing Picross quite a bit, but the other games are becoming lost causes..  Starting ANOTHER game would be foolish right?</p><p>Whatever..  i want a fun Wii game that i can sink time into.  I like the Wii quite a bit, but i'm stuck in Trauma Center, and Wii Sports and Wii Play don't really hold my interest.  The only other game i play quite a bit on my Wii is Gunstar Heroes, but i'm getting my assed kicked on Level 5.</p><p>Anyways..  i bought Wii Twilight Princess and started playing it yesterday.  There's a pretty stunning difference between the gamecube version and the wii version of the game, which everyone already knows about.  Traditionally Link is a left-handed sword wielder, but the vast majority of earth's population are right-handed sword wielders.  Rather than re-code Link's physics or model, they decided to mirror the entire game.  In other words, Right is Left and Left is Right.  Now link is right-handed... i guess.</p><p>I didn't think this would really bother me at all, but i find myself getting lost every now and then when i'm trying to find a house or navigate throughout the world.  Dungeons are pretty easy though, since i hadn't spent nearly the amount of time i have in villages or the world overall.</p><p>The obvious difference is most certainly the controls.  I'm not a big fan of the Wii controls.  Aiming with the slingshot, boomerang, etc is FAR better with the Wii-mote, but sword play is way too flexible.  On Gamecube Twilight Princess, you just hit the B button to slash and beat up things, but on the Wii you swing the Wii-mote back and forth motion which loses a lot of precision.  It's far worse than using an analog PS2 controller for a fighter..  The jousting event took me about half an hour to finally figure out when the sword actually swings when i jerk the Wii-mote to the side.  With the Gamecube controller, you hit the button and Link swings the sword right then.  Precision is key when you come to events based on timing and the Wii-mote doesn't offer that type of precision.  I eventually figured it out, though ^_^</p><p>The other thing that annoys me is the lack of camera views in the Wii version.  On the Gamecube controller the C-button left and right would move the camera left and right.  The C-button up and down would pull and push the camera away from and towards Link.  Unless i'm missing it, there is no camera movement in the Wii version at all.  I've been using the Z button to correct the camera's placement.</p><p>They should've used the D-pad for the view changing, but ended up using that to store weapons.  In this way, Link can have 4 total weapons out at once rather than 3 in the Gamecube version.  The Wii controller is a little disadvantage for button mapping though.  Both controllers have 8 buttons, an analog stick and a D-pad, but the Wii controller lacks that C-button stick on the Gamecube controller.  So, rather than code around this problem, it seems that they just omitted camera controls from the game.</p><p>Unless i'm missing something..  I'm probably missing something..  maybe you can do Camera control with the B button on the Wii.  I dunno..  i'll try that out tonight.  oh wait...  B button is for items..  i shall consult the instruction manual.</p><p>Anyways, I still prefer the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess for a few reasons.  1) It was designed and developed to take advantage of the Gamecube, whereas the Wii is just a port.  The whole mirrored world thing is pure proof of that, which removes the traditional left-handed Link.  2) The sword swinging feels too loose, and lacks the precision that a simple button push provides on the Gamecube.  and 3) I'm probably bias towards the Gamecube version because i played through it before the Wii version.</p><p>I dunno.  I think that if i had played the Wii version first, i probably would've liked the feel of the controller better, but be annoyed about the aiming schema. :shrugs:  I guess we'll see what happens...  It's still the great amazing game you must play if you own a Gamecube or a Wii.  Quite possibly the BEST gamecube game ever made. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Coin Money" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/coin-money">Coin Money</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week, the US Mint released new $1 coins in the market place.  This is the third attempt for the US Treasurery to get rid of the paper dollar and use something a bit more solid.  With good cause too.  According to <a href="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/5853746.html" title="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/5853746.html">this article</a> the average life span of a dollar bill is about 2 years.  The dollar bill is a frail piece of paper that get used over and over and over again.  The bills are torn apart during their lifetime, and must be replaced.  Any coin pretty much lasts forever.</p><p>I wonder why the dollar coin hadn't worked before.  Maybe it's because it wasn't widely adopted so those with a dollar coin couldn't use it in it's most convience places, like vending machines and parking meters.  There's also the psychological barrier of switching something so standard in our lives.</p><p>Well, i think about how money is generally used in Japan.  Over there, they have coin currency up to 500 yen, or $5.  Their standard lowest paper money is the 1000 yen note, or $10 bill.  You'd think having more coins, would mean having more change to lug around all day long, but it's quite the opposite.  When your coins have more value, you keep track of them a little better because of their worth, but also because you're using these coins whenever you pay for something.  If you buy something for 425, you'll be reaching in your pocket for a 500 coin anyways, why not grab all your change and whiddle the excess down at the same time.</p><p>After we ran our food stand at the festival, we sold our tacos for 250 yen.  An easy 3 coin purchase.  So..  after we had our profits it was almost all coin.  I changed up all the coinage for bills with my own money.  I ended up having so many coins i couldn't even carry.  But, each day i would grab a hand full, and stuff my little coin pouch and attempted to see what i could get rid of.</p><p>Very few places in Japan take credit card..

| February 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, Nintendo released a simple game for the Wii with a similar release style as was the case with Wii Sports.</p><p>Wii Play is just 9 simple little 'flash' style games that are 'guaranteed' to build your skills using the full capabilities of the Wii-mote.</p><p>These 9 games are:<br/>Duck Hunt<br/>Memory<br/>Some weird bubble game<br/>Ping Pong<br/>Air Hockey<br/>Pool<br/>Fishing<br/>Cow Racing<br/>Pocket Tanks</p><p>There was talk of this game being difficult to find, and it was a nintendo release, so i figured that i should look into picking it up. Part of this rarity stems from the game being packaged with an additional Wii-mote. The game is priced at $50, with a $40 controller.</p><p>Anywho, when i got to Best Buy yesterday, they actually quite a large pile of them. I was kinda surprised with the frenzy i've seen about the Wii.</p><p>I got home, and started playing through some of the games...</p><p>ugh... Each and everyone of these games are shallow, and they don't offer new or innovative gameplay. It's like a bunch of unpolished tech-demos Nintendo scraped off the floor into a bag. I played it for about 2 hours yesterday with my roommates, and i'm honestly bored of it already.</p><p>The other problem with this game is it's only 2 player. I probably would've gotten a couple more hours of enjoyment out of this game if they added 4 player support.</p><p>Honestly, if you want a bunch of stupid games that test your wii-mote skills buy <span style="font-weight: bold">Rayman</span>. Rayman has about a ba-gillion mini-games which actually require skill, uses the wii-mote is many different ways, has decent graphics, and occasionally is funny.</p><p>The only going for Wii Play is that it equates to a $10 game, and comes packaged with another controller for your Wii.</p><p>It's hard to pass up though. I think that even if i read this, i'd probably still buy it because, hell... it's $10 for something to play on my Wii and another controller.</p><p>:shrugs: oh well....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Japanese Phones" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/japanese-phones">Japanese Phones</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Adults usually work all day, and Kids are usually at school all day.  Even when they aren't at their places of business or work, they usually aren't home.  The Japanese usually conglomerate somewhere in the town, rather than each other's homes.  Therefore, they need something to keep them connected with all their friends and business associates.  This is why cell phones are so grand in Japan.  If you don't have one, then you must be tied to a phone somewhere or a computer somewhere to keep in contact with your friends to figure out what's up.  You'd be stuck in your tiny apartment or house waiting for something to happen, rather than walking around the town getting something done.  This is also why the Japanese people leap until mobile technology faster than in the US.</p><p>The Japanese use their cell phone as their primary communications device.  More Japanese connect to the Internet through their phone, than on a computer, and more Japanese send emails back and forth from their phone, rather than calling each other.  Whether on a train, on a bus, or just walking, you can easily see most pedestrians typing away with one hand on their cellphone.</p><p>Since cellphones are so widely used, the market for making phones is probably the largest technological market in Japan.  If you walk into any electronic department store, you'll be bombarded with their cellphone area almost right away.  There are 3 main cellphone companies in Japan: DoCoMo, Soft Bank, and Au.  Their stand-alone stores are almost just as common as convenience stores.</p><p>The phone company i went with was Soft Bank, and purely because of their options.  I was looking for a prepaid phone, so that limited my choices to Au and Soft Bank right away.  Now these companies don't have prepaid only models.  They have prepaid plans that can go on specific models.  These plans usually nerf all but a few options for the phone.  The prepaid plan for the Au phones nerf almost all the options, and only allow the user to email other Au users.  The prepaid plan for Soft bank phones pretty much did the same, except allowed emailing to any email address.  Well that narrowed down the choices pretty fast.  So i got a slick looking Soft Bank phone.</p><p>Anywho...  each store has a vast variety of different cellphones you can choose from.  Some vary in options, but every single cellphone is complete with the internet, emailing, and an infrared sensor.  Most phones have cameras, and most phones have marginally large hard-drives for playing mp3s.  Another such model actually has an antenna  for catching TV receptions.</p><p>Whenever you come across some poster advertisement in Japan, you'll probably notice a square barcode like design printed with it.  Well, that's just one of the many uses of the infrared sensor.  You can set the sensor to capture, and point your phone at this barcode.  The barcode acts as a URL when it's received by your phone, and will automatically bring you to a website from the advertisement.</p><p>McDonalds makes full use of this technology by stamping one on each of it's product's wrappers.  You can scan the wrapper's barcode, and it'll bring you to a webpage detailing the nutritional information of what you're eating.  pretty handy.</p><p>The other main use of the infrared sensor is to send contact information back and forth between other cellphones.  This skips the whole process of asking what someone's phone number is, and then tediously typing it into your phone.  The sender can just send the info across infrared and the receiver can capture this information effortlessly.</p><p>In Japan, my cellphone and a pocket map were my two main pieces of equipment (besides id and money) in order to get around and do things without being tied down to anywhere.</p><p>___</p><p>In contrast, American phones are so damned primitive.  It's like beating two rocks together to make fire.  Of course, we don't need anything so helpful in our society because we're usually home.  You could just call their house.  With cellphones, in America, now you can call the person directly, but you wouldn't want to email said person, because they are more than likely driving around since everything is so far apart.  Internet?  That's what computers are for.</p><p>As bitched about before, American cellphones annoy me.  Though, despite being annoyed by my own phone on occasion, the auspicious Cingular 8525, it actually acts as a very nice Japanese phone, even though it's not cool looking and somewhat heavy.  It can do internet and email just fine, but the one thing i played with last night has sold me on it. (even though, i already bought and paid for it)</p><p>The 8525 actually has one of these infrared sensors on it, so i wondered if my American phone could talk with my Japanese phone.  An interesting experiment, indeed.  I turned on my Japanese phone and sent a contact over through infrared...  huzzah. My American phone captured the information and actually noticed it was a Contact..  It didn't decipher the 'title' of the contact correctly, but all the other information was intact.  I'm actually rather impressed..  I moved most of my Japanese contacts over to my phone in a matter of 20 minutes.  It took about a minute per contact.  Though, it doesn't allow me to enter detailed contact information about myself into the phone without listing myself as a Contact :/  oh well..</p><p>Now my next fun experiment shall be if the 8525 can read Japanese cellphone barcodes and make sense of them...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cellular Wars Part 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cellular-wars-part-2">Cellular Wars Part 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Wednesday, after careful, clear and balanced thought, i just said to myself, "aww fuck it... "  I went into the Cingular store i signed up for the <a href="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp" title="http://business.cingular.com/businesscenter/8525/index.jsp">8525</a> phone that i outlined in my <a href="/old/v7/cellular-wars" title="/cellular-wars">previous post</a>.  This phone could do quite a bit, but whether or not it had Japanese Language Support and ability to work in Japan were questionable.</p><p>Well on this day, the guy i had been talking with for the past two weeks had those answers.  According to Cingular technical support, the phone does indeed work in Japan.  However, Microsoft does not provide any Japanese Language Support for the phone.  Though, he didn't stamp out the possibility altogether.  His technical guy also explained that with 3rd party software, Japanese Language Support is attainable.</p><p>At this point, the phone was pretty much complete and i really didn't want to wait another 2 or 3 weeks of careful, clear and balanced thought before i decide to come back here and probably get it anyways.  So i bought it..  huzzah.</p><p>But now i have this phone which is basically a laptop.  It has Microsoft Office on it for god sakes.  As i held it in my hands i thought to myself..  "ok.. this is just a little bit too much.  I don't need all of this..  why in the hell WOULD anyone need this amount of stuff on their phone unless they didn't have a laptop."</p><p>Buying something so grossly over-kill felt dirty..  i mean, if the thing wasn't a phone, it would be useless to me.  i was going against my cheap ass nature, into a realm of wasting money.  It feels like their had to be a cheaper sleeker alternative.  or something of that nature.  latching on unpolished technology is always a waste of money.  But whatever..  i can afford it, so where's the harm really.  I want a phone that can utilize Japanese and this is what is available to me.  :shrugs:  Later on in the evening, i started playing around with the phone.  Adding in contacts, setting up features..  It really wasn't all that bad...  I could get used to using it.</p><p>The next day, i decided to take it for a test run.. ya know,  Carry it around with me and see how it feels.  Hell, if it obstructs my daily comfort level, the thing has got to go.  Honestly, it's pretty comfortable.  I don't know how big you think it looks from the picture on their site, but it's just as big as my little wallet.  The phone i was borrowing from my mom is bigger in 2 out of 3 dimensions..  Of course, this thing is far more fragile than my mom's beast of a phone.</p><p>The 8525 had passed my comfort level test, so i guess it'll stay.  Now i bring down the whole gadgety feel of the phone to a personalized level and it'll work out just great.</p><p>I began looking for some phone software on the Internets of all places..  After typing in "Windows Mobile 5.0 Japanese", the first hit was what i was looking for: <a href="http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php" title="http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php">http://www.mobem.com/products/cestarwm5.php</a> Mobem Technologies had created Chinese and Japanese support for my operating system.  Huzzah...  I haven't gotten around to ordering it yet though :/   The next thing i need to find it some weather application to tell me how fricken cold it is outside.</p><p>Another feature of the 8525 is that it connects to WiFi connections.  In fact, it'll search automatically for them, which is pretty funny.  It usually makes a sound when it finds one, but when it's on silent, it'll vibrate.  So when i'm driving down the street in my neighborhood, it'll vibrate a couple times because of all the secure connections.  How helpful.. ^_^  It's a war-driver's most convenient device.  The war-driving vibration is a little difficult than the phone call vibration, so i don't need to go digging in my pockets while i'm driving every time the thing goes off.  I haven't gotten any mail on my phone yet, so i'm not quite sure if it'll vibrate for that.  I hope it does, though..  I suppose i could test that though...</p><p>Anyways, i guess i'm happy with it, even though when my roommates first saw it they said, "that's a phone?!  guhhh?"  I figure that's going to be a lot of people's reactions ... :/  It needs a more phone-y look.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Crank" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/crank">Crank</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>yesterday, i finally got the privilege of watching one of the fall lineups grandest movies: <b>Crank</b>.  Crank stars action-star Jason Statham as a double-crossed hitman.  He's been poisoned and must keep his adrenaline up, or else his heart stops.  The first time i heard of such a movie i thought it was one of the greatest movie concepts i had ever heard.  Over-the-top Action after over-the-top action after over-the-top action.</p><p>And that's exactly what this movie is.  Statham just beats the shit out of so many people, it's ridiculous.  Almost every scene he is in has some element of violence or drugs which fuels the over all adrenaline rush of the movie.  There's a few scenes where he's going through the hospital looking for epinephrine, and randomly pushing over patients for no reason..</p><p>This movie has a sense of humor in that way, but it also knows when it's being retarded.  The first action sequence of the movie features Statham driving through a mall, which is COMPLETE RIPOFF of Blues Brothers, which we just so happened to watch the other day.  The writers knew they were ripping it off, and made sure the audience knew this by adding in the line from Statham, "there sure are a lot shops in this mall."</p><p>It's also rather funny how there is no sense of boundaries at all.  Statham does drug after drug after drug, steals police cars, breaks things.  It's like they put everything bad that some irrate mother would complain about, they put it in and flaunted it.  It's kinda like Grand Theft Auto the movie, but not a movie about the story of GTA, just when you go around killing people and stealing cars for no reason.</p><p>This movie has everything i could've hoped for, but i find difficulty liking it.  It's so fricken Spike TV...  but that's what makes the movie so kickass.  Action, Action, Action for those with no attention span.  this attitude lends itself so well to the movie, since the main characters can't stop at all to figure out what's going on.  He's gotta get revenge before he dies, and if he stops....  Game Over.</p><p>The movie also has no shame when it comes to product placement. Need Adrenaline? Red Bull, Rockstar, and plenty other energy drinks and in there.  You could also say Cocaine, Pot and Nasal Spray fall under the category of product placement too.</p><p>Anywho... i suppose if you haven't seen Crank, you should definately give it a go.  Especially if you think over-the-top action movies are hilarious because the movie does go out of its way several times for a gimmick.  But as for owning it?..  eh..  maybe for the purposes of showing it to others.</p><p>Unfortunately i haven't seen either Transporter movies, so i can't really compare it to those.  For some reason, i have the feeling they are pretty similar to this.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
