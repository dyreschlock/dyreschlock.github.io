| March 12, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I attended the 30th Annual International Seminar of Budo Culture, which coincided with the 150th anniversary of the start of the Meiji era in Japan.  This year’s main lecture was <b>The Features and Potential of Japanese Budo Culture</b> given by Seiichi Takeuchi <span class='ja'>竹内</span> <span class='ja'>整一</span>.  He is currently a professor at Kamakura Women’s University, and former professor of the University of Tokyo.  His field is the study of ethics and Japanese thought.</p><p>The lecture was given in Japanese and translated into English by Alex Bennett, who is currently a professor at Kansai University and has written and translated many books on the Japanese Budo arts.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my 3rd time attending the seminar.  Every year I’m able to get amazing insights into budo martial arts and learn about their connection to Japanese psychology and culture.  I previously wrote about the main lecture from the first seminar I attended two years ago: <a href="/old/v7/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan" title="/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">March 4th, 2016</a>.</p><p>Overall, I felt the contents of the lecture did not match the title, but the main idea expressed in the lecture was another fascinating look at an explanation for Japanese culture.  The theme carried through the explanations and examples was that of <i>onozukara</i> and <i>mizukara</i></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」</span></b></div><p>Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> explained the cooperative duality of these two forces behind the decisions and actions of people in Japanese culture and society.</p><p><i>Onozukara</i> <span class='ja'>おのずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自然の働く</span><br/><i>Mizukara</i> <span class='ja'>みずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自分の能力</span></p><p>Let’s do <i>mizukara</i>, first.  <i>Mizukara</i> is the effect from oneself.  It’s the idea that an action or decision you made came as a result of your own willpower.  <i>Onozukara</i> is the workings of nature, the idea that there is an overwhelming force behind a decision or action that made or allowed it happen.</p><p><i>Mizukara</i> is pretty easy to understand, but <i>Onozukara</i> is much more ambiguous.  In western countries, <i>onozukara</i> could be similar to the will of god.  God is an outside influence, and people often thank God for giving them fortunes, or blame God for misfortunes.  This was brought up in a question after the lecture had finished.</p><p>But for Japanese people, the idea of God is not a singular entity.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned if you asked a Japanese person who they pray to when they pray, they would not have an answer.  They wouldn’t know.  The will of nature is a result of many different factors and moving parts within the world and society.</p><p>As another example, another question was asked, "Did you decide to do this lecture? Or was it the will of nature?"  He replied that he did want to do lecture, but he was also asked by many people to do it.  The people he knew and the connections he’s made throughout his life knew his expertise that made him qualified to give a lecture on this subject.  In that way, there was a force that created the opportunity for him to accept.  So, this lecture was a result of the actions of both nature and self.</p><p>So, the idea of <i>onozukara</i> is the force of everything around us.  It’s the connections we’ve made with people in our lives, the opportunities society gives us, and nature itself.  It is not, directly, "the will of God."</p><div class='title'><b>Example within Japanese Language</b></div><p>These two concepts aren’t something that is thought of on the surface level.  People aren’t consciously thinking about the will of themselves or nature when making decisions.  But there are examples within the Japanese language that build on this idea.</p><p>The main example given was <b>I am to be married</b> <span class='ja'>結婚することになった</span>.  When people get married in Japan and they announce it to their family and friends, they use this phrase.  It’s very passive and reflects the idea of <i>onozukara</i>.  Getting married is simply a matter of course.  It’s natural.  Additionally, the effect of getting married wasn’t just decided or caused between the two involved.  It was the culmination of the people around them and their families’ blessings and good intentions.</p><p>He did mention later in the lecture that a lot of young people these days use a more affirmative phrase when speaking informally about marriage, <span class='ja'>結婚することにした</span>, <b>we’ve decided to get married</b>.  The two getting married take responsibility for their marriage as opposed to passively excepting it as a matter of nature.</p><p>There could be any number of reasons for why this is becoming more popular.  Perhaps young people aren’t being taught more tradition methods of speaking than they were before.  Maybe people aren’t getting married as often as before, so they don’t hear the phrase enough.  Or perhaps, as English and the western world becomes more prevalent in Japan, people are becoming more direct and affirmative when expressing themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Connections to Budo</b></div><p>As a practitioner of a budo martial arts, we also seek for our movements to become natural.  In the beginning, we chose to study a martial art of our own free will (<i>mizukara</i>).  We all have our reasons for wanting to do it, whether it be for health, for friends, for fun, or because it looks cool.  We start from ourselves.</p><p>There Japanese word <span class='ja'>習う</span> <i>narau</i> means "to learn", but literally, it means "to continually repeat things" and becoming accustomed to it.  As a result, over time, these actions become natural.  You no longer need to think to do them.</p><p>In Budo, we strive for this level of movement where the thought process is no longer a factor, and to become part of nature, the natural flow of life (<i>onozukara</i>).  When movements and actions are not performed naturally, they are not seen as being complete.</p><p>In Kyudo (archery), for example, when one reaches the level of complete mastery, the practitioner feels that the bow no longer exists.</p><div class='title'><b>The 3 points of Japanese Thought</b></div><p>Within the balance of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> is the concept of Japanese thought and 3 points that define it.</p><p><span class='ja'>自然</span> <i>shizen</i> - nature<br/><span class='ja'>意気</span> <i>iki</i> - will power<br/><span class='ja'>諦念</span> <i>teinen</i> - resignation</p><p>The idea of <b>nature</b> leads to accidental fury that was must put up with.  It’s something that we must endure and grow from.  <b>Will power</b> is the willingness to put your body on line for what may happen.  And if something goes wrong, it’s your responsibility to <b>resign</b> yourself to the outcome, and not make excuses for the result.</p><p>Though, resignation does not mean to simply give up.  It’s about reconciling the efforts of one’s will with the movement of nature, and to be able to see something clearly for what it is.  And in some cases, recognize your powerlessness to deal with whatever comes.  We take for granted our power over nature and often think that we can overcome it, but in reality we cannot.  Nature is a much greater force.</p><p><span class='ja'>申し訳ない</span> <i>moushi wakenai</i><br/>This phrase literally translates to "there were no reasons behind my actions" or "there is no verbal excuse for what I have done."  This is used as a strong apology in Japanese, but an actual apology means to explain your actions and why you were wrong.  This goes one step further by saying there can be no excuse for the action I’ve done.  In this way, you’ve accepted the outcome (resigned) and take full responsibility (will power).</p><p>On the other hand…</p><p><span class='ja'>すみません</span> <i>sumimasen</i><br/>This is used as a light apology and basically means <b>excuse me</b> or <b>sorry</b>, but the direct and complete translation is something closer to "my actions were not clear or clean or complete," or "I wasn’t able to completely do this action myself."</p><div class='title'><b>Other Japanese Words</b></div><p>Much like the lecture on the cardinal virtues of Japan, speaker Seiichi Takeuchi wrote several books on the subject of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.  He wrote 4 books, actually.  3 of which are out-of-print and expensive!  On Amazon, they are being sold for nearly 7000<span class='ja'>円</span>.  But, there was one book I could buy for only 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」のあわいで</span> <span class='ja'>やまと言葉で</span> <span class='ja'>哲学する</span>.</b> or <i>onozukara to mizukara no awai de yamato-kotoba de tetsugaku-suru</i>.  <i>Awai</i> isn’t so easy to translate, but I was told, in this context, that it basically means between.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> talked about this balance between both <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> in his lecture, so I think it makes sense.  <i>Yamato-kotoba</i> basically means words (<i>kotoba</i>) that encompass the spirit of Japan (<i>yamato</i>).  And lastly, <i>tetsugaku</i> is philosophy.  So, the title is basically <b>The Philosophy of Japanese Words and Their Existence Between the Balance of <i>Onozukara</i> and <i>Mizukara</i></b>.</p><p>The book starts off with a quick summary and definition for <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>, and then has chapter on specific Japanese words, phrases, or expressions, their history, and their connection to <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For example, <span class='ja'>ありがたい</span> (thanks), <span class='ja'>めでたい</span> (congratulations), <span class='ja'>あう</span> (when meeting someone), <span class='ja'>あいする</span> (loving someone), and so forth.  Maybe in the future, I’ll try and go through some of these chapters and write something about them.  For many people, though, Japanese philosophy is an incredibly dense topic.</p><div class='title'><b>Relation to Myself</b></div><p>Anyways, </p><p class='img'><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Lecture Abstract</b></div><p>Japanese will often say things like <i>kekkon suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to be married) or <i>shuushoku suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to start work).  It should be expressed as "I decided to …"  Even if something is decided by the will of the individual (<i>mizukara</i>), it is expressed as something that has been predetermined for him or her as a matter of course (<i>onozukara</i>).  This in turn indicates a tendency to accept things in one’s life and the world as being naturally preordained and to be accepted passively.  The Japanese philosophers Kuki Shuuzou identified three elements in the features of Japanese thought: "nature" (<i>shizen</i>), "chic" (<i>iki</i>), and "resignation" (<i>teinen</i>).  This means that based on "natural" (<i>onozukara</i>) conduct, when something occurs the individual decides from one’s self (<i>mizukara</i>) to confront the situation putting their own body on the line (for example, seppuku) in the spirit of "chicness" (<i>iki</i>), while also resigning (<i>teinen</i>) the self to go with the natural flow (<i>onozukara</i>).  The culture of Japanese thought is considered within the encounter between the movement of nature (<i>onozukara</i>) and exertion of the self (<i>mizukara</i>).</p><p>Japanese budo culture is the same.  According to Kuki, "The ideas of Japanese morality maintain a significant meaning in universal nature (of <i>onozukara</i>)…  Morality which must reach the stage of becoming 'natural' cannot be seen as complete."  The term "morality" (<i>doutoku</i>) can be replaced by the word "budo" here.  In bud, first engaging in rigorous training or study from your own volition (<i>mizukara</i>), if it does not ultimately become an inevitably natural (<i>onozukara</i>) activity then it "cannot be seen as complete."  To "<i>narau</i>" (learn) means "to continually repeat things" thereby gradually becoming accustomed (<i>nare</i>) to it, and "reaching the stage where it is natural."  In the culture of Japanese bud, there are correlations with moral, religious, and artistic thought in that one’s own efforts (<i>mizukara</i>) will finally proliferate into and connect with natural expansiveness and depth (<i>onozukara</i>).  Seen in this way, the features and potential become apparent.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Cardinal Virtues of Japan 日本の元徳" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">The Cardinal Virtues of Japan 日本の元徳</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The 2016 International Conference of Budo Culture featured two main lectures.  The first one was titled <b>The Cardinal Virtues of Japan</b> and took place directly after the opening ceremony on the first day.  The lecture was given by Kanno Kakumyou <span class='ja'>菅野</span> <span class='ja'>覚明</span>, a professor at Kogakkan University, whose expertise is in Japanese ethical thought in fields such as Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and bushidou.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was spoken in Japanese, and translated/interpreted by Bruce Flanagan, lecturer at Tokyo University of Science of Engineering, and Toyo Gakuen University Theory of Interpreting and Translation.</p><p>The lecture, <b>The Cardinal Virtues of Japan</b>, had the following abstract:</p><div class='title'><b>Lecture Abstract</b></div><p>One typical Japanese manner of thinking suggest that our life is actually a path (<i>michi</i> or <i>dou</i>) on which we journey day-to-day towards self-improvement.  This philosophy is evident in Japanese arts such as poetry, singing, calligraphy, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement, where the names of the art includes the suffix <i>dou</i>.  Budo is another example.  Budo is a system of armed and unarmed fighting techniques, but martial arts and skills alone do not constitute budo in the philosophical sense.  Actual fighting techniques were called <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> and were considered distinct from budo.</p><p>The goal of <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> is to defeat an opponent but this is not necessarily the case in budo.  Naturally, budo practitioners also train to defeat an opponent, however that is just one part of the process of achieving the larger goal of self-development.  Put simply, in budo, as with training in other <i>dou</i> arts, perfection of one's character is the ultimate objective.</p><p>An individual who has achieved excellence in a particular field may be called a <i>meijin</i> (master) or <i>tatsujin</i> (expert).  While the terms <i>meijin</i> and <i>tatsujin</i> refer to the technical proficiency of the individual, the terms may also be used to refer to an individual who possesses unique traits and is recognized as being wise or holy, such as Confucius or Buddha.  Budo as a form of <i>dou</i>, provides the practitioner with a 'path' or means to achieve the enlightened awareness of a wise or holy person.  If, through achieving a high degree of self-development, a person has attained some desirable attribute, then we call this personality trait their 'virtue' (<i>toku</i>).  There are many difference kinds of virtues that people try to develop in themselves and these values are generally universal.  However ethnic, cultural, and religious groups often differ in their opinions on which virtues are the most important.</p><p>Fundamental virtues of particular importance are called 'cardinal virtues' (<i>gentoku</i>).  In Christianity, faith, hope, and love are espoused as the three cardinal values (Corinthians 13).  In ancient Greek philosophy, wisdom, courage, restraint, and justice, formed the four cardinal virtues.  In Confucianism, the five values were benevolence, justice, courtesy, wisdom, and sincerity, and the the three virtues were wisdom, benevolence, and courage.  In this lecture I will discuss some of the important virtues associated with Japanese budo taking into account Buddhist and Shinto thought.</p><div class='title'><b>Unpacking the abstract, and defining terms</b></div><p>First, a virtue or <i>toku</i> <span class='ja'>徳</span> is a positive personality trait.  It's something that contributes to the dignity of one's life.  <i>Gentoku</i> <span class='ja'>元徳</span> is a fundamental virtue of importance, or <b>cardinal virtue</b>.  These are the basic building blocks of what makes a desirable personality.  As mentioned above in the abstract, wisdom, benevolence, courage as examples of cardinal virtues.</p><p><i>Budo</i> <span class='ja'>武道</span> is field of martial arts, but it doesn't cover all martial arts.  According to The Budo Charter, budo are Japanese martial ways that have been transformed and evolved from combat techniques (<i>jutsu</i>) into ways of self-development (<i>dou</i>).  There are only nine such martial arts: judo <span class='ja'>柔道</span>, kendo <span class='ja'>剣道</span>, kyudo (archery) <span class='ja'>弓道</span>, sumo <span class='ja'>相撲</span>, karatedo <span class='ja'>空手道</span>, aikido <span class='ja'>合気道</span>, shorinji kempo <span class='ja'>少林寺拳法</span>, naginata <span class='ja'>なぎなた</span>, and jukendo <span class='ja'>銃剣道</span>.  </p><p>As mentioned in the abstract, most of these martial arts carry the kanji suffix <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>, which identifies them as a path to self-improvement.  Many other arts in Japan also carry this suffix, such as tea ceremony or <i>sado</i> <span class='ja'>茶道</span>, calligraphy or <i>shodo</i> <span class='ja'>書道</span>, and flower arrangement, or <i>kado</i> <span class='ja'>華道</span>/<span class='ja'>花道</span>.  I don't really understand why iaido <span class='ja'>居合道</span> isn't a budo art, but I guess that's because it's not meant as a means for combat?  Or perhaps it doesn't stem from a former form of combat?</p><p>Despite being different forms of combat, training, and practice, budo martial arts are all connected by the same virtues of self-development and self-improvement.  If a martial art does not follow these virtues, and doesn't set one on the path to self-improvement, it is not considered <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>.  In that case, they are pure fighting techniques, or <i>jutsu</i> <span class='ja'>術</span>.  The virtues of those martial arts and sports are different.</p><p>Because all forms of <i>dou</i> carry the same virtues and basic fundamentals, scholars consider this the reason why so many military commanders and famous swordsman of the past were also great poets, musicians, and writers.  They had some deep connections with themselves and could easily express it.</p><p>This is also why many budo practitioners these days have ranks in multiple branches of budo or other Japanese arts, rather than only one course of study.</p><div class='title'><b>3 important Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>After reading that description and beginning the lecture, I really wanted a straight list of virtues.  I wanted something like, "The cardinal virtues of Japan are…"  But that's not how it went.  Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned that there would not be enough time to mention all the virtues of Japan, and explain why they were so revered.</p><p>Looking through my notes of the lecture, and from what I remember, he focused on 3 particular virtues he found as important.</p><p>- <span class='ja'>礼</span> <i>rei</i> - respect and gratitude<br/>- <span class='ja'>文武両道</span> <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> - the balance between strength and wisdom<br/>- <span class='ja'>無</span> <i>mu</i> - nothingness</p><div class='title'><b>Rei <span class='ja'>礼</span></b></div><p>Physically, <i>rei</i> is the act of bowing.  It's an expression of the importance of order, and an outward expression of our inner <b>respect</b>.  It's a sign that we should love and respect other people, rather than hate.  All human relations are founded on the two principles of <i>shinrai</i>, people trusting and being friendly to each other, and <i>sonkei</i>, acknowledging and respecting those different from you.  And physically bowing to someone is an expression of both.</p><p>As an example, it is respectful for hosts to please their guests.  It's their duty to go above and beyond the capabilities of their guest and impress them.  And it's respectful for guests to acknowledge and show gratitude for everything the host has done for them.  Even if they disappoint, it is always the guest's duty to return the same magnitude of respect to the host.  In that same vain, bowing is also a show of <b>gratitude</b> and thanks.</p><p>In his lecture, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> brought to the topic to respect on the battlefield, or <i>gunjin no rei</i> <span class='ja'>軍陣の礼</span>.  Though, battlefields and war refer more to the fighting done in the warring states period of Japan, not necessarily modern warfare.  Before a battle or fight, bowing to your opponents shows mutual respect for each other as warriors.  Bowing at the end, signifies a return to the state outside on conflict.  It was a way to preserve our humanity even in the face of conflict, and separates us from animals.</p><p>Without bowing on the battlefield, we're nothing but blood-thirsty war-mongering people.  Winning a battle or war at all costs, and dehumanizing and humiliating the enemy is a sign of cowardice and disrespect.  These kind of people are not human, and should be dealt with like animals.</p><div class='title'><b>The Balance between Strength and Wisdom</b></div><p>There's a Japanese term called <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> <span class='ja'>文武両道</span>.  As long time ago, it meant being accomplished in both literary and military arts, or, that all military training should be correctly balanced with scholarship.</p><p>Today, the meaning has changed a little.  Now the translation means having both <b>strength</b> and <b>wisdom</b>.  It basically means the same thing, but the military and fighting connotation has been removed.  This change was influenced by western thought thanks to terms like "the pen is mightier than the sword."</p><p>The forces of strength and wisdom are often depicted with red and blue colors.  In popular culture, these colors often depict characters that represent strength or wisdom, such as the power rangers.  If you remember the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the red ranger was the leader of the group, and always the strongest.  He is usually not smart, but feels passion and emotion which often leads him into combat.  The blue ranger, while not necessarily the weakest of the rangers, was certainly the smartest.</p><p>But, strength doesn't mean to simply have physical strength.  Strength also refers to their strength of ones heart and will.  It's the ability to love and compassion.  Without this kind of strength, a person is just blood thirsty.  True warriors fight with compassion.</p><p>You can see this ALL the time in Shonen Jump series such as Dragonball and One Piece.  Goku and Luffy often lack the wisdom side of the coin, but their strength always comes their compassion for their friends, or what is just or right.  They never enter into a fight for no reason.</p><div class='title'><b>Nothingness <span class='ja'>無</span></b></div><p>The goal for any budo practitioner is to be able to perform moves and actions naturally and without thinking.  This is known as a state of <i>jizai</i> <span class='ja'>自在</span>, or naturality.  How is this done?  One way is to achieve this state of nothingness.</p><p>By nothingness I mean that the practitioner wishes to have a simple state of being.  This can be done through the unification of the following 3 states of consciousness:  <b>sincerity</b>, <b>selflessness</b>, and being able to <b>free the mind of thoughts</b>.</p><p>Following these states, the practitioner is able to free themselves of themselves.  Their own ego, wants, and desires are no longer in their way, and everything becomes instinct, and natural.</p><p>True masters and experts strive for this ideal state of character, and can achieve these states at will.</p><p>This aligns with true virtues:  the virtue of <b>honesty</b> or <i>shoujiki</i> <span class='ja'>正直</span>, and the virtue of <b>purity of spirit</b>, or <i>seijou</i> <span class='ja'>清浄</span>.  The lecturer make a point by saying, "I believe these are the most important of the virtues."</p><div class='title'><b>The Book of Japanese Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>Not quite being satisfied from my notes of the lecture, I wanted to know all of the cardinal virtues of Japan.  I wanted the finish this sentence: "The cardinal virtues of Japan are …"  Fortunately, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> literally wrote the book on the subject.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lecture was actually just a small snippet of what he wrote about.  Though, the book isn't just an answer to "What are the Cardinal Virtues of Japan?"  It's a published account of all personality traits found good and desirable in Japan in different circumstances and situations, how they've been developed, and how they relate to budo culture in most cases.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I can't actually read it.  But, I can translate the table of contents and form a decent list of what's inside.  The contents are split into 4 sections: order and harmony, world citizenship, self-development, and objects of self-improvement.</p><div class='title'><b>Order <i>chitsujo</i> <span class='ja'>秩序</span> and Harmony <i>wagou</i> <span class='ja'>和合</span></b></div><p>These virtues mostly deal with the inner expression of yourself.  These are your thoughts and feelings about the world around you, and how you conduct your life.  Some of these are also outward expressions that demonstrate or convey your inner thoughts and ideals.</p><p><span class='ja'>側隠の心</span> <i>sokuin no kokoro</i><br/><b>Compassion of the Heart</b> or "showing sympathy or pity."  Apparently <i>sokuin</i> has more of a negative connotation, so I think "pity" is better.  But, that doesn't really make sense.  Wouldn't the ideal be showing compassion and sympathy for others by not looking down on them?  Being one with them, and looking past any ego driven or vain thoughts about yourself?</p><p><span class='ja'>敬</span> - <span class='ja'>「うやまう」「つつしむ」</span> <i>kei</i> - <i>uyamau tsutsushimu</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b>.  Being able to show respect <i>uyamau</i> to other people, and being modest <i>tsutsushimu</i> about your own achievements.  This is the same kanji used in <i>keigo</i> <span class='ja'>敬語</span>, which is the honorific / respectful words and language used in Japanese.</p><p><span class='ja'>清浄</span> <i>seijou</i> <br/> <b>Purity</b> - pure of heart / innocence (like a baby)</p><p><span class='ja'>礼</span> - <span class='ja'>天地の序</span> <i>rei</i> - <i>techi no ji</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b> and <b>Gratitude</b>.  This was already mentioned above, but it's the idea of performing things in a set order.  The act of bowing preludes heaven and earth.</p><p><span class='ja'>倹約</span> - <span class='ja'>均衡</span> - <span class='ja'>調和の知恵</span> <i>kenyaku</i> - <i>kinkou</i> - <i>chouwa no chie</i> <br/> <b>Frugality - Balance - Harmony of Wisdom</b>.  This is the idea that simplicity is best.  You should rid yourself of unnecessary things in your daily life, and only live with what is needed.  You must manage overindulgence.</p><div class='title'><b>World Citizenship <span class='ja'>世の中の一員</span></b></div><p>These virtues are about yourself outward expression to the world.  This is how someone should conduct themselves as a member of their community, society, and the world.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> - <span class='ja'>百行の本</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>hyakkou no moto</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> - the foundation of all actions.  Filial Piety means your undying loyalty to your parents and family, and essentially having the capacity to support them as they have supported you.  Apparently, this is foundations of all of our actions in our lives.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> (<span class='ja'>続</span>) - <span class='ja'>親子の真実</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>oyako no shinjitsu</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> (continued) - the nature of the relationship between parent and child.</p><p><span class='ja'>勤勉</span> - <span class='ja'>世のため人のための徳</span> <i>kinben</i> - <i>yo no tame hito no tame no toku</i> <br/> <b>Diligence</b>.  This is the virtue of people who do things for the greater good of the world.  Those that work hard everyday at what they do.</p><p><span class='ja'>義</span> - <span class='ja'>人間の条件</span> <i>gi</i> - <i>ningen no jouken</i> <br/> <b>Morality</b> or <b>Justice</b> - the human condition.  Members of yakuza gangs use the term <i>gi</i> to describe the rules they enforce in the public and among themselves.</p><p><span class='ja'>信義</span> - <span class='ja'>公共の精神</span> <i>shingi</i> - <i>koukyou no seishin</i> <br/> <b>Trust</b> / <b>Faith</b> / <b>Loyalty</b> - the spirit of common sense.  This means having faith in society that they'll do the right things, and by being a member of society that you uphold that faith of common sense.</p><p><span class='ja'>分別</span> - <span class='ja'>大人の道徳</span> <i>bunbetsu</i> - <i>otona no doutoku</i> <br/> <b>Judgement</b> (or <b>Discrimination</b>) - the morals and ethics of adults.</p><div class='title'><b>Self-development <span class='ja'>自己を育てる</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>誠</span> - <span class='ja'>修行の思想</span> <i>makoto</i> - <i>shugyou no shisou</i> <br/><b>Honesty</b> or <b>Integrity</b> - the ideals of <i>shugyou</i> training.  Translating <i>shugyou</i> only as 'training' loses a lot of its meaning.  <i>Shugyou</i> training is strict self-disciplined mental and physical training like a samurai.  Examples would be doing the same disciplined training everyday exactly the same to achieve perfection.  Or, there's the example of a samurai sitting and meditating under a waterfall.  The purpose is to try and attain a state of zen or a state of <i>mu</i>.  It's these ideals that establish integrity.</p><p><span class='ja'>忠</span> - <span class='ja'>普遍的価値への奉仕</span> <i>chuu</i> - <i>fuhen-teki-kachi e no houshi</i> <br/><b>Loyalty</b> - devoting oneself to the universal values of loyalty.</p><p><span class='ja'>和</span> - <span class='ja'>『憲法十七条』の精神</span> <i>wa</i> - <i>[kenpou 17 jou] no seshin</i><br/> <b>Harmony</b> - the spirit of the Seventeen-article constitution.  The Seventeen-article constitution is a document written by Prince Shoutoku Taishi in 604.  It was a highly Buddhist and Confucian inspired set of morals and virtues that were to be expected of government officials and the emperor's subjects.  An excerpt from Wikipedia states, "Harmony is to be valued, and the avoidance of wanton opposition to be honored."</p><p><span class='ja'>克己</span> - <span class='ja'>忍耐</span> - <span class='ja'>現代に最もっとも必要な徳</span> <i>kokki</i> - <i>nintai</i> - <i>gendai ni sai motto mo hitsuyou na toku</i> <br/><b>Self-Control</b> - <b>Patience</b> - the most necessary trait in our modern age.</p><p><span class='ja'>定心</span> - <span class='ja'>存心</span> - <span class='ja'>正念</span> - <span class='ja'>正気に返れ</span> <i>joushin</i> - <i>zonshin</i> - <i>shounen</i> - <i>shouki ni kaere</i><br/><b>Meditation</b>, <b>Feelings from the heart</b>, and <b>True Faith</b>.  Meditation is the spirit of Buddhism.  You rid yourself of all distractions and focus your mind on a single thought.  You keep yourself in a free state, void of feeling, or a level feelings.  It's like a state of nothingness.  You try to achieve a state of zen.  True Faith is being able to control or correct your bad feelings, and bring in good feelings.</p><p><span class='ja'>怨望</span> - <span class='ja'>日本人の弱点</span> <i>enpou</i> - <i>nihonjin no jakuten</i><br/> <b>Envy</b> - a Japanese weakness.  The first kanji is also used for the verb <i>uramu</i> <span class='ja'>怨む</span>, which means to have a grudge against someone.  But, this boils down to resentment, jealousy.  There's a really common utterance in Japanese: <span class='ja'>いいな</span>.  Directly, it's translates as "that's good," or "that's awesome," but it carries a sense of wanting with it, like, "I want that to," or "I wish I had that, too."  I'm not sure if including this virtue is an example of something bad, or if it's just part of being Japanese, good or bad.</p><p><span class='ja'>勇</span> - <span class='ja'>肉体に根ざす徳</span> <i>yuu</i> - <i>nikutai ni nezasu toku</i><br/> <b>Bravery</b> or <b>Courage</b> - the fundamental trait that makes up the human body.</p><p><span class='ja'>仁</span> - <span class='ja'>生命のものの徳</span> <i>jin</i> - <i>seimei no mono mo toku</i><br/> <b>Benevolence</b> or consideration and compassion for other people.  Humanity.  This is the virtue of all existence and life in general.</p><p><span class='ja'>志</span> - <span class='ja'>人生の司令塔</span> <i>kokorozashi</i> - <i>jinsei no shireitou</i><br/> <b>Intention</b> or <b>Motive</b> - the central drive or direction that controls our lives, or your reason for doing the things you do.</p><p><span class='ja'>『教育勅語』の徳目</span> <i>[kyouiku chokugo] no tokume</i><br/><b>Types of virtues taken from the "Imperial Rescript of Education"</b>.  The Imperial Rescript was kind of like the Pledge of a Allegiance in the US.  It was something that all school children (prior to World War II) would read and say in school.  It requested that people advance public good and promote common interests, always respect the constitution and observe the laws, and should emergency arise, offer yourself to defend and maintain the prosperity of the Imperial Throne.  These days, Japanese people consider this nationalist train of thought dangerous as it lead to the mistakes of war.</p><div class='title'><b>The Objective of Self-improvement <span class='ja'>修養の目標</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>男一匹</span> - <span class='ja'>新渡戸稲造の修養論</span> <i>otoko ippiki</i> - <i>Nitobe Inazou no shouyou ron</i><br/><b>The perfection of masculinity</b> - Nitobe Inazou's idea of self-improvement.  This is the ideal that every Japanese man wants to be.</p><p><span class='ja'>すてきなひと</span> - <span class='ja'>女性らしさの徳</span> <i>suteki na hito</i> - <i>josei rashisa no toku</i><br/><b>"Beautiful" Person</b> - feminine virtues.</p><p><span class='ja'>三種の神器</span> - <span class='ja'>政治家の徳</span> <i>sanshu no jingo</i> - <i>seijika no toku</i><br/><b>Three Sacred Treasures</b> - the virtues required of politicians.  These are honesty <span class='ja'>正直</span> <i>shoujiki</i>, compassion <span class='ja'>慈悲</span> <i>jihi</i>, and wisdom <span class='ja'>知恵</span> <i>chie</i>.</p><p><span class='ja'>老木の花</span> - <span class='ja'>亀の甲より年の功</span> <i>rouboku no hana</i> - <i>kame no koi yori toshi no koi</i><br/>(<b>Idioms</b>) The Flower of an Old Tree - wise old man wisdom from a turtle shell.  These are virtues found from idioms, or wise old sayings passed down by generations.  Heeding this wisdom shows respect to the elderly.</p><p><span class='ja'>無私</span> - <span class='ja'>徳の大きさ</span> <i>mushi</i> - <i>toku no okisa</i><br/><b>Nothingness</b> - the size of a virtue.</p><p><span class='ja'>中庸</span> -<span class='ja'>「普通」</span>- <span class='ja'>こそが究極の徳</span> <i>chuuyou</i> - <i>[futsuu]</i> - <i>koso ga kyuukyoku no toku</i><br/><b>The Golden Mean</b> - <b>Normality</b> or being average - virtues of the ultimate goal.  This is about sticking to the group, and not being extreme.  But, it can also mean being fair, and not taking sides.  Ultimately, this idea came from China.</p><div class='title'><b>Translation</b></div><p>The book is quite dense.  It'd be like a Japanese person trying to translate a bible into their language.  Some of these virtues deal with the roots of modern day Japanese culture stemming from China.  Others are wholly formed Japanese ideals.  One easy way to identify traits stemming directly from Japanese ideals are the words that use a single kanji.  Usually words with two or three kanji stem directly from Chinese kanji.</p><div class='title'><b>Balance</b></div><p>Out of everything, I found the topic of balancing strength and wisdom particularly important to me.  Not being able to fully understand Japanese (and perhaps the way they train junior high students) has made me miss a lot of the theory and thought process behind the moves and training I've done thus far.  Even the written test makes the test-takers only memorize the words written, but not actually think of their own answers.</p><p>The lecture on the following day mentioned that one cannot learn a budo art by training alone.  Someone who only trains technique and only builds physical strength and speed will never be on the same level as someone who balances training both their body and mind.</p><p>This conference was immensely valuable to me because of this.  It identified my largest weakness in learning kendo so far.  The idea of always training in kendo doesn't necessarily make you better at kendo.  Improving aspects of your life, and bringing balance to everything will improve your skills as well.</p><p>Good habits in your life are brought into your budo, just as the bad habits, too.  If you're a well-organized person, those ideals are brought into your performance.  If you're a slouch or a sloppy person, those ideals are also brought in, too.  Kendo and other budo arts are an expression of your inner self, and your moves and techniques mirror those ideals.  This is what your opponent sees when faced against you.  </p><p>And things I improve in kendo translate back in my life.  Kendo is no longer just something that I do.  Kendo is who am I.  It's a part of me.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Micro-aggressions in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/micro-aggressions-in-japan">Micro-aggressions in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 28, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year, at our second Skills Development Conference, I gave a quick speech about micro-aggressions.  I quickly talked about what they are, what's the problem, and how I deal with them.  I tried to give the topic justice as 2 years prior another ALT gave a similar talk about it, too, and I found it really helpful when dealing with some of the problems of daily life in Japan.</p><p>This was part of a session of "micro-panels" which is consisted of 4 shorter talks about various subjects.  Subjects not necessarily long enough or useful enough to take over their own 50 minute panel.  I budgeted this talk at 10-12 minutes.</p><p>I had some help with this presentation, too.  Fellow ALT and RPA Cathy Anatra volunteered for this subject, too.  Though, I pretty much took over the whole thing, and talked about the things I wanted to talk about.  She helped me QA the speech, and gave me some direction and pointers if I was missing anything.  She also gave some of her own personal experiences during that part of the talk.</p><p>But!  Here's what I wrote.  This is my intended transcript for my talk.  I also included most slides from my powerpoint, and the time-stamps from when I timed myself speaking.</p><div class='title'><b>Micro-aggressions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" /></p><p>The term "micro-aggressions" carries some baggage with it for those who have heard it before.  This is the definition I use:  A micro aggression is an everyday slight, indignity, or invalidation unintentionally made towards a marginalized group by a well-intentioned person of the majority.  In the case of Japan, the marginalized group would be us.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" /></p><p>These actions may seem small, and not even a problem, but day after day, they add up into something greater.  They not only make us feel different, but they point out how different we are to the society we are living in.  They point out that we don't fit in, and possibly that we won't fit in.  We're not the same, and we're outside of their circle.</p><p>I'm not talking about directly racist or insulting things, though.  I should really underline the terms "unintentionally" and "well-intentioned" in my definition because these are the comments I wish to focus on.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" /></p><p>I think the top 3 comments I've gotten over the years have been, "<span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>！", "<span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>？", and "<span class='ja'>何とか休みは帰りますか</span>？".  (or) "You're Japanese is so good!", "Can you eat natto?", and "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?"  Or even..  "where will you travel?"</p><p>We've all heard these haven't we?  <span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>?  Really?  I've said 2 poorly constructed sentences, and my Japanese is good?  <span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>?  Yes, I can eat natto.  Do you think it's poisonous to me, or something?  Am I too inferior to eat it?  <span class='ja'>帰りますか</span>?  Will I return?  Are you asking because I need to go back to "my people."  Because I don't belong here?  Because I'm an outsider?</p><p>Here are some more examples:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" /></p><p>These are the kind of micro-aggressions we all get a daily basis.  The first couple of times, it's no big deal, really.  But after months and years, they get tiring and their indirect messages become the real conversation. <br> [2.5 minutes]</p><p>Going back to my definition, this is not intentional.  The person talking to you is unaware of the underlying message being communicated.  They don't "mean" to make us feel alienated, or unwanted with these comments.  And this is why it's difficult to confront the "aggressor" about it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" /></p><p>If you confront the other person, and respond to their comments or questions in the same vain as I had just now, you can guarantee they won't make the mistake of talking to you again.  You've basically alienated yourself.  If you want to go more extreme with this example, perhaps you've now made this person think all westerners are confrontational about the smallest of comments or questions.</p><p>However, if you go the other way, by ignoring or shrugging off the comments, you're letting the problem persist.  And you've allowed yourself to soak up more of these comments.  They build and build, and eventually you revile and hate Japan.  If you want to go extreme again, perhaps you'll become a steaming pile of hate whom can never smile, and then no one will talk to you.  You've eventually leave Japan, and tell everyone how terrible a country it is.</p><p>In both instances, you've alienated yourself, and even created or perpetuated stereotypes.</p><p>So..  what's the solution?  You are.  We are.  I think we are the solution.  <br>[1.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" /></p><p>For me, I hadn't heard of this term before coming to Japan.  I first learned about it at our SDC two years ago.  I was at a point where after making friends with some teachers and parents, they made a couple of comments that pushed me back, and made me feel distant.  They made me feel like I didn't belong and wouldn't ever belong.</p><p>One of the things that turned me around was learning that this word even existed.  It gave me comfort, and it gave me strength.  This is the reason why I wanted to give this talk, and inform everyone about this word.  Knowing about this word allowed me contextualize the comments that were being made, rather than see them as direct assaults against me.  And through that I was able to deal with them appropriately.</p><p>As an example, at an enkai, one of my teachers kept talking to me in a baby voice.  I think we were talking about hiking and mountain climbing, and she kept responding very deliberately and emphatically.  It really felt like she was talking down to me.  <span class='ja'>そうですね。すごいですね。</span>Patronizing.  <span class='ja'>何とか山をのびますか。</span>As if she had to speak this way in order for me to understand.  </p><p>Even though it annoyed me, I just ignored it, and continued with the conversation.  A few minutes later, she began talking with another teacher, and she had the exact same tone.  And she continued that way throughout the rest of the night.  So it wasn't that she was talking down to me, or anything.  That's just the way she talks. <br>[2 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, my solution is not to confront, nor ignore, but to respond in a way that creates a conversation.  I think that's one of the most important responsibilities for us in Japan.  We should live up to our titles as unofficial cultural ambassadors.  We shouldn't directly confront their stereotypes about us, but we should bring them up from time and time, talk about them, and inform the other person about you as a person, rather than you as a race.</p><p>Going back to the natto conversation, I just respond with the truth.  Eh… it's okay.  Nothing special.  Do you like natto?  How often do you eat natto?  What food do you like or hate?  I try to pull them into the conversation, rather than it being one-sided.</p><p>Going back to the questions, "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?" or "..will you travel?"  I really see this more as an icebreaker for small talk.  While you could take it as them thinking your life in Japan is just a temporary home, I think a lot of them want to live vicariously through you.  They would love to have your "freedom" to travel around Japan, or the world.  They want to know more about these places, and how it related to their own lives.  And they want to know more about your home country, too.</p><p>This was even true at my previous job back in the US.  One of my co-workers' spouses said that she loved reading my blog, and looking through all the pictures I posted online from visiting Japan.  She liked to live vicariously through me because they don't really travel outside of the country that much.</p><p>Both these questions aren't assaults against you because you're different.  A lot of the time, many of those examples from earlier are just icebreakers.  Other people want to talk to you, and get your opinions on things that may be different for you.  It turns into an opportunity for you to inform and educate others about those differences.  It's usually a great topic of conversation.</p><p>Going back to the baby speech, sometimes if they talk to you like a baby, it could be that they just aren't aware of the amount of Japanese you understand, or perhaps they just don't know how to properly communicate with a foreigner.  Talking with them more often, and finding shared interests will give them more exposure to yourself, and to foreigners in general.  And make them more comfortable talking to us.</p><p>Overall, I would say to put yourselves in their shoes.  Think about where they're coming from when making some of these comments.  <br>[3.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" /></p><p>Lastly, I think it's important to understand that we can be just as guilty as making micro-aggressive comments or actions as they are.  It's important for us as we attempt to defuse micro-aggressions directed towards us, that we in-turn, identify and defuse any that we make ourselves.</p><p>I think the two most common ones for me are finding legitimate ways of complimenting or correcting other people's language, and finding ways of talking to Japanese people in English that doesn't sound like Tarzan-speech, or baby speech.</p><p>After receiving so many ill-gotten compliments on my Japanese, I never compliment anyone on how well they speak English because I'm too afraid of sounding like they do to me.  Though, I have a few teachers that have gotten A LOT better at English since I first met them that probably deserve some kind of compliment or reassurance because of how hard they've tried to get better.  I would say that if you were to compliment someone on their English, don't make a single one-off compliment.  Tell them why you think it's good, and why you felt you had to compliment them.  By giving them the reasons for the comments, it becomes sincere and worthwhile.</p><p>As far as talking like a baby, or talking like Tarzan, I think it's very important for us to speak as grammatically and emphatically correct as possible when using English around Japanese people.  Adults can definitely tell when they're being talked down to.  But for our students, we are the "perfect" model for them to learn correct English.  They listen to us way more than you might realize.  They have a keen ear for inflection, emphasis, and intonation.  If you're "dumbing down" your speech to be more understandable, some of those traits could be accidentally taught to them.</p><p>I have an example of this.  Sometimes when talking slow, I add unnecessary emphasis on some of my words.  Especially, the word "and."  One of my students did the speech contest last year.  I helped him write the English for his speech, and I recorded myself reading his speech, so he could practice it over and over again at home.  I used "and" as a conjunction between two sentences, like so, "So, I think one reason manga is so popular is the choice for readers.  And, I think it's fun to cosplay characters that appear in manga."</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" /></p><p>When speaking at normal speed, the "and" works as intended.  It's a soft conjunction joining the two sentences.  But, when I slow down, the "and" becomes much more pronounced.  It no longer sounds natural or correct if spoken at normal speed.</p><p>From that point on, whenever we read something in class that uses "and" as a conjunction, this student always has that extra unnecessary inflection.  Weirdly enough, my JTE has started doing it, too.</p><p>Again, this example isn't really a micro-aggression in of itself, but an example that your "model" of English, if thought correct, will be imitated.  Please keep it in mind.  <br>[4.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" /></p><p>Anyway, that's my speech, and that's my advice to you.  Thank you. :D</p><div class='title'><b>Finished</b></div><p>I don't think my talk had the same impact of when I first heard about micro-aggressions, but hopefully it inspired some of the audience members to think about things.</p><p>As mentioned before, this was part of a collection of micro-panels at our Skills Development Conference in January.  I was the MC for the entire panel, too, so I wrote an additional 3 minute speech to fill time at the end, if needed.</p><p>Later this year, I'll give this speech at our farewell enkai for those ALTs leaving the program.  It combines two things I've come across talking about foreigners or "outsiders" fitting into Japan.</p><p>Enjoy! :D</p><div class='title'><b>Fitting in Japan</b></div><p>I have another story about living in Japan, or abroad in general.  We are all circle people.  We lived in our circle country, spoke our circle language, and hung out with our circle friends.  We fit in.  Our circle pegs fit perfectly well into the circle holes of our lives.</p><p>But now we're in a triangle country.  Our circle pegs don't fit into the triangle holes.  Being here changes us.  We make many conscious and unconscious decisions on a daily basis that changes our circle shape to more closely resemble a triangle.  We lose some things, and gain some things.  The longer we stay, the more and more we become a triangle.  Though, obviously we can never fully be a triangle, but we can make ourselves fit in.</p><p>As we return to our circle country, we won't fit in at first.  As time goes on, our circle shape will return, but we'll never be as round as we once were.  The story finishes by saying we've become a shape that doesn't necessarily fit into either country.</p><p><br/>One of my students once wrote a speech on what it was like being half Japanese, and half American living in Japan.  Because she felt like she didn't fit in Japanese society, she always considered herself half Japanese.  She finally had the chance to visit the US, and while she physically felt like she fit in, she couldn't speak English well, and didn't really fit in there either.  She felt half American.  </p><p>She told this to her grandfather, and he gave her the following advice.  He was envious of her position.  He never thought of her as half Japanese, or half American, but BOTH Japanese and American.  He never saw her as half-anything.  She is a double.  That really changed the view she had on her own life.</p><p><br/>The experiences that we have in Japan, and the changes that happen to us, stay with us well after we leave.  They ultimately shape us into the people we will become, or into the people that we are.  While perhaps we think we're losing some of ourselves to fit in, we are gaining so much in the process.  And we eventually become part of both societies.<br>[3 minutes]<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Writing Lesson Plans (JET Orientation)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/writing-lesson-plans-2">Writing Lesson Plans (JET Orientation)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| August 19, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Every year in the JET program, we say goodbye to those who have not re-contracted, and we say hello to a bunch of new people coming in to replace them.  Starting this year, I'm an RPA, which stands for Regional Prefectural Advisor.  And as RPAs, one of the things we do is hold a Work Orientation seminar to give useful advice to the new people of our prefecture.  </p><p>I volunteered to give a presentation about lesson planning, and how I do lessons.  To prepare for this, I wrote out an entire transcript of what I planned to say.  So, that is the following text, though I changed a few things for it to read better.  This is similar to my <a href="/old/v7/writing-lesson-plans" title="/writing-lesson-plans">previous blog post</a> about lesson planning, but this assumes the reader (or listener) has no knowledge of lesson planning, or classroom experience at all.</p><p>Enjoy!</p><div class='title'><b>Let's Begin</b></div><p>Hi there everyone.  My name is Jim, and I'm starting my 4th year as an ALT. </p><p>This session is about lesson planning with a little introductory about the classroom setup, and classroom flow, as well.</p><p>First, I'll talk about my background.  Next I have a handout for everyone.  It has two lesson plans that I wrote and have used on both sides.</p><p>The first real topic is about talking with your homeroom teachers about your upcoming lessons.  Next, I will actually explain the lesson plan format I use for the handouts.  Then we'll go through the flow of a typical English class for me.  And that's further broken up into 3 parts: beginning, middle, and end.  The next topic is about having a goal or purpose with your lessons.  And then, I will explain what ESA means.  More on that later.</p><div class='title'><b>My Background</b></div><p>Let me give you a little background about myself before I start my presentation.  This shall give you some proper context on where this information is coming from.</p><p>I'm not an education major.  I majored in Computer Science and Mathematics and worked for more than 6 years before coming here to teach English.  Prior to coming to Japan, I had no classroom teaching experience, no training, no real education, and absolutely no idea what I was supposed to do, or how to do it.  Even after I arrived and started "teaching", I still had no clue.  I have a feeling many new ALTs are in this exact same situation.</p><p>But, I did have one thing.  Prior to coming, I had signed up for an online TEFL course.  For those who don't know what TEFL stands for, there are two terms actually.  TEFL is Teaching English as a Foreign Language.  and there's TESOL, which is Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages.</p><p>I signed up through ITTT or teflonline.net, which was advertised through the JET website.  You can get a discount by using your JET number.  I think normally it's $300, but you get a $100 discount.  </p><p>Before coming to Japan, I went through about half of the course.  I became too wrapped up with packing and moving my life to Japan, that I quit for the time being.  The first half of the course was about some theories, classroom management, and grammar.  Nothing really concrete.  As one ALT currently talking the course told me, it's very "Mickey Mouse".</p><p>After being in Japan for a few months, I decided to finish before the course expired.  The second half of the course focused on actually writing plans which is what I was already doing in my schools.  So, I was learning things I could immediately use, and could easily see the value in what I was being taught.</p><p>Overall, this presentation is about two things.  First, It's about the single most valuable thing I learned from my experience.  And it's about the single most valuable I learned from that course, and how I consistently use it when planning and writing my lesson plans.</p><p>But, before I explain that, I want to show and define what I mean by Lesson Plan.</p><div class='title'><b>Handout</b></div><p>These are two of my actual lesson plans I used for my classes.  Though, I recently rewrote it for clarity, and to reflect what I actually did in the class.  My original plan had too much going on to fit in time.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-3.webp" /></a></div></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74Md3F4dGtOX3V4cXM/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-lesson-4.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Just to note, I know this looks a bit daunting.  To be clear, you don't necessarily NEED to be this detailed when planning your lessons.  I do things this way for a couple of reasons.  I can talk about that a little bit later if we have time.</p><div class='title'><b>Talking with the Teacher</b></div><p>For every class I've ever planned and taught, I've written something similar to this.  Before I teach this class, I will make a copy, and give it to the homeroom teacher.  As I give it to them, I will explain and discuss the entire thing, so they know exactly what to expect when I come to their class.  I will go through the plan, bit by bit, and explain each action.  I explain what I will do, what I want them to do, and what I want the students to do.</p><p>This can be a problem for new ALTs that don't know a lot of Japanese as most homeroom teachers don't know a lot of English.  In fact, I have one homeroom teacher in particular that no only doesn't understand my English, but has trouble understanding my Japanese.  And really I can't understand a lot of his Japanese either.</p><p>But even for you guys that don't really know a lot of Japanese, I have some small bits of advice.  And perhaps the other RPAs could jump in too, if they have any advice.  </p><p>But 2 things:</p><p>1: Use simple English.  As simple and direct as possible.  And 2: Use a lot of gestures, to explain your actions.  In addition to gestures, drawing pictures and diagrams work really well, too.  These are the things I did before getting a lot more comfortable with the Japanese language.</p><p>Whatever you do, however you do it, <b>getting them to understand your plan is essential</b> for a successful class.  Again, I have some reasons.</p><p>1. This is a great way to practice how you intend to explain your games and activities to the students.  If you can't correctly and concisely explain and demonstrate your ideas to the teacher, most likely the students won't be able to understand it either.</p><p>2. Next, talking about your plan out loud, and trying to explain things to someone else, is a good way to figure out any problems you might not have thought of.  Also, the teacher probably has a good idea whether or not something will go well, or fail outright.  So, talking about things is a good way to iron out any problems.</p><p>And 3. Explaining everything to the homeroom teacher will allow them to jump in and explain things to the students when they have trouble understanding you.  </p><p>Talking about everything before class will allow you to teach the class together, rather than being there alone, or trying to figure out things in front of the students, and wasting class time.</p><div class='title'><b>Explanation of the Lesson Plan</b></div><p>So, let's go through it!</p><p>At the top are the schools and classes where I will use this plan.  The dates are empty.  I usually write those in when I make a copy for the teacher.</p><p>On the next line, first is the grade.  Next is the plan number, so this is my third "official" class with the sixth graders.  Next is the Lesson number, which refers to the chapter in the book.  Next is the class number for that lesson, so this is my first class for lesson 5.  And a quick descriptive title for the lesson.</p><p>Next is the grid.  The first column is the how many minutes I expect each part of the lesson to take.  Bolded numbers are for the section.  The second column is the activity for each row.  Underlines are for each section.  Next column is "Contents", which is a quick description of what we'll do during that part of lesson.  Next column is "ALT".  This is what the ALT will do during that part of the lesson.  Next is "HRT".  This is what the homeroom teacher will do.  Next column is "Goal" or "Purpose".  This is why you are doing whatever in the lesson.  And last is "Grammar" and "Vocabulary".  This is the words or grammar I intend to teach the students.  Sometimes I have a description or translation along with it.</p><p>On the bottom, I have a row for materials.  These are the materials that are needed for the classes.  For "ALT", this is what I will bring.  For "HRT", this is what I will need from the HRT for class.  And for "Students", these are things the students will use in class.</p><p>Underneath, is for homework.  This is something new I've been doing this year.  I usually assign something for homework every 2 or 3 classes.  So far, it's just been writing practice, or doing an interview with family members or other teachers.</p><p>Finally, at the bottom is a date.  This is essentially the version number for this plan.  It's the most recent time, I have updated it.  So, if I make changes, and have a bunch of print outs, I can tell which one is correct.</p><p>On the other side is a URL where you can get this plan online.  Though, I'm bit behind with that.  The idea is that if some teacher or ALT in the future comes across this plan, they can go online and find all the plans associated with this lesson, downloads for materials, and possibly a blog post explaining how well or how bad the class went using these plans, and how I could make it better.</p><p>Questions?</p><div class='title'><b>Flow of Class</b></div><p>The handout has two lesson plans written on it.  There's #3 and #4, so these are back-to-back.  Let me quickly go through how I used this plan in class, and how a typical class will operate.</p><p>I don't know if they mentioned this during Tokyo Orientation, or if we did during Life Orientation, but I think it'll helpful to reiterate it.  And if you haven't heard of it, it'll be good, too, because then you will know about what happens before you step into class for the first time.</p><div class='title'><b>The Beginning</b></div><p>First, the ninchokyu, or subject leader, will come to the front.  They'll tell everyone to stand up, kiritsu.  They'll say attention, or kyoutsuke.  Then they'll say the Japanese aim for the class, or they'll say, "Let's start English."  And then the class repeat, "Let's start English."  Then they say sit down, and every sits down.  Then the class begins.</p><p>For me, first is the greeting.  I'll say, "Hello everyone"  And then they'll reply, "Hello Jim" or "Hello Jim-sensei"  Some classes call me Mr. Jim.  One class called me Jim-teacher for a little while.  Only the foreign kid calls me Mr. Hendricks, which is really weird, and I don't like it.  Then the teacher greets the class, and they reply.</p><p>Then we do questions.  I always do, "How are you?" and have the students reply with as many unique answers as possible.  Then it's "What day of the week is it today?"  Then "What is today's date?"  Then "What time is it?"  And then "How is the weather?"  For some reason, junior high schools ask these questions at the start of every class, so I try to do the same for elementary, so they already know everything.  In 5th grade, I teach the days of the week.  And 6th grade, I teach the other 3.</p><p>After that, I will place today's plan on the board using these cards.  And these cards correspond to the terms in the "plan" column of the lesson plan.  I will show each card to the class, and they'll repeat the word on the card.  They'll also see the meaning underneath.  Then I'll place the cards on the side of the board, so it's always visible in class.  This is so the students know exactly what's going on in class, and what's coming next for today.  As another RPA pointed out, this is also a great way for the teacher to keep track of class too, and not get lost.</p><p>I do this every time.  During this part, many of my students have memorized all of these words and want to guess my plan. So, they start yelling out what they think the next card is.</p><div class='title'><b>The Contents of the Plan</b></div><p>Then we'll go through the plan set on the board.  And actually, my following description of this plan is almost exactly how I describe the plan to the homeroom teacher of the class.</p><p>First is reviewing lowercase, which was the contents of the first two lessons.  And it's quick quiz, showing them the letters and asking, "What's this?"  I'm doing this with the whole class, but it would probably be better if I quizzed individual students.  But I don't want to spend too much time doing it, because it won't be used in the rest of the lesson.</p><p>For Today's Aim, I will write that aim on the board, and then ask students to try and read it.  Some students can, but most can't.  I'll ask them to repeat after me, and then we'll try and translate it as a class.  All of my aims begin with "Let's", so all my students know what that means.  Some students can figure out other words, and closely guess the Japanese meaning.  But eventually, I'll just tell them what it means.</p><p>It took me a long time to get comfortable using Japanese in class, or really even knowing enough Japanese to be used in this way.  This is the kind of thing that your homeroom teachers should be doing in class, so if you don't really know Japanese, or aren't comfortable with it, please ask the teacher to help explain any English you want to students to know.</p><p>My students know how bad my Japanese is, so they correct me a lot when I mistakes in class.  But they can almost always understand what I'm trying to get across.  Though, as a rule, you aren't supposed to use Japanese with students, since they're learning English.  But...  that's another topic, we can talk about later.</p><p>Anyway, next on the plan, I'm passing out the homework sheet to students with all of the flags I intend to teach, along with the English name written next to it, and space for them to practice writing.  This is not for them to practice writing in class, it's for them to try and read the English name written on the sheet.  Writing practice is for homework.  Again, there's another rule that says elementary schools are to focus on communication in class, never on writing since that comes later in junior high.  Again another topic we can argue about later.</p><p>And then the HRT and I introduce the flags to the students, and I ask them for the English name.  They can try to read, but I eventually tell them what it is.  And then they repeat it after me.  The book only teaches 10 countries, but I bumped that up to 18 because it was too easy otherwise.  Most students already know the names.  Also, for some students that have problems at English, I mention to them that they can write the Katakana pronunciation on their worksheet, if they can't remember the words.  Doing this is yet another debated topic for another time, but really only a few of my students actually do it, and it does help them quite a bit.  I never do it for them.</p><p>After all these flashcards are on the board, then we practice them again all at once.</p><p>For the grammar, I write the English on the board, and ask them to try and read it.  Some can.  Then we practice speaking the grammar as a class.  I will ask them what they think it means in Japanese.  And then write the Japanese on the board, explaining each of the parts.</p><div class='title'><b>Activity - Keyword Game</b></div><p>For the activity, we'll do the keyword game.  This is another one of my go-to games that the students really enjoy.  You can read the description on the plan, but let's go through the setup.  First, students make pairs with their partners, and place an eraser between them.  For each round, I will choose a keyword from the vocabulary.  Students will try and listen for that word.  When they hear it, they'll try to grab the eraser faster than their opponent.</p><p>I modified this game a little bit to have more grammar, and be a bit more complex.  First the students will ask the question, "Where do you want to go?"  I will reply with "I want to go to ____."  If they don't hear the keyword, then they'll repeat that phrase.  And then ask the question again, and continue the round until they heard the keyword.</p><p>Let's Play!</p><p>As you can see on the sheet, first we'll explain the game, though I frequently do this game, so some students know it by name already.  Then we play the game.  This game and others with similar setups are extremely great.  They have very little setup, and you can finish them at any time.  But even though, they're great to fill time, they are extremely repetitive, so you don't want them to go on long.</p><div class='title'><b>Finishing Class</b></div><p>Finally, to close class, I have evaluation.  Many teachers have their own goofy names for this.  The first teacher I worked with called it "Good Job Time" so I've been sticking with that since.  There's probably a better name for it, but whatever. It's fine.  During evaluation, I will choose a student who I thought did really well.  And then the homeroom teacher will choose another student.</p><p>The student I choose is someone who could complete goal, and could also accomplish the 3 points I have listed on the side.  The student had a <b>good smile</b>.  The student made good <b>eye contact</b> with their partner during conversation.  And they used a <b>clear or loud voice</b> that was easy to understand.  </p><p>This lesson kinda sucks for that because the students didn't really communicate with each other.  It was all repeating and listening.  For this class, I would probably choose a student was paying close attention to what I was saying, and really tried to get the pronunciation correct for the countries.  Or used a really clear loud voice during the game.  Or perhaps, I'll choose a student terrible at English, but who really tried their best, and made some small improvement.</p><p>Whatever the reason, I make sure to clearly say why I choose this student, and what they did during class do deserve today's honor.  There's really no point in doing evaluation if you randomly choose a student, and the class has no idea why they were chosen.</p><div class='title'><b>Taking and Assigning Leads</b></div><p>One last thing about this plan.</p><p>If you take a look at the plan, I have these certain sections marked with an asterisk.  That is to indicate the lead for that part of the lesson.  So, for passing out the homework, I will take lead.  Then the homeroom teacher will take the lead introducing and explain the country flags.  Then I will lead the repeating part of the lesson.  And then it will go back to the homeroom teacher, and they'll take over introducing and explaining the grammar I want them to learn.</p><p>In theory, this is how I want to class to work, but in practice it never really works that way.  Again, this comes back to communicating with your teacher.  A lot of teachers are quite shy about the English that they know.  I'm sure many of you can relate with your Japanese skills.  For example, when I first came to Japan, I knew some Japanese, but I was not comfortable at all with what I knew.  I would never speak in public with it because I was way too shy and self-conscious about it.</p><p>So understand that the homeroom teachers are in the same situation.  They have to help teach students in a subject they barely even know themselves.</p><p>My supervisor has instructed me to actually push these teachers into using their English more, but in a lot of cases, I end up doing most of the asterisk points, and the homeroom teacher hangs back, and helps out with any Japanese.</p><p>So anyways, that's the whole plan.  Any questions?</p><div class='title'><b>Having a Goal or Purpose</b></div><p>Having a Goal or Purpose is an essential part of any lesson plan.  This is for you to explain why you are doing what you are doing.  And this can help you get rid of non-essential crap that might just be wasting class time.  </p><p>This will also help you design an overall idea and plan not just for this single class, but for the entire lesson as a whole.  Again, this is class #1 for this lesson.  All other classes for this lesson to follow will build upon what I teach in this class.  Likewise, the things I teach in class #2 will continue being used in the lessons after.</p><p>I think the technical term for this is called <b>scaffolding</b>.  First, you need to clearly establish the basics.  Then expand on those basic concepts, by adding in the necessary complexity, a little at a time.  Once you have established everything, you need to use these concepts, and end the lesson in a meaningful and satisfying way.</p><p>When I think about planning lessons in this way, it reminds me of basic storytelling where you have a beginning, middle, and end.  In the beginning, you're introduced to the characters and everything is laid out in a simple way.  In the middle, shit happens.  This is where things start to get a little complicated, but interesting.  And the end is where all the complications come together in a meaningful and satisfying way.</p><p>The Departed is a fantastic example of this.  Same with Fight Club, Breaking Bad, and Lost (maybe).</p><p>As a concrete example of this, you may have noticed that even though this is my third class for my sixth graders, I'm already doing Lesson 5.  This is because my end goal for this lesson, or it's <b>ultimate activity</b>, so to speak, was to interview foreigners during their school trip at the end of May.  I wanted to get them interested in other countries in the world, and then come face to face with those people.  And I wanted them to learn questions they could ask these foreigners, and use those communicative skills in real life, rather than confines of their classroom.</p><p>I actually have another document that partially describes this arc.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><div class="noImage"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74McG1kLXZ2WF83TGc/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150819_lessons/h27-sixth-syllabus-page1.webp" /></a></div></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These are my first 5 lesson for the sixth graders.  First we did the lowercase letters, and then we have the countries.  Here is #3.  There's a quick review of letters, then introducing the countries.  Quickly introducing some grammar, then practicing it.  Next class, #4, review countries, introduce more grammar, and then practice that grammar.  But here, they're also learning about the countries.  Last one, #5, review countries, review grammar.  There's a quick listening activity.  And then we're doing a full interview, where students each other, "Where do you want to go?" and the other stuff.</p><p>Before their trip, I had 3 more classes which taught them more specific words and phrases they could use with foreigners.  First class was the teaching.  Second class was practicing.  And the third class, some students pretended to be foreigners, and the others interviewed them.  And then they switched.</p><p>For two of my schools, it was a huge success.  They took a lot of photos of themselves with the foreigners they met.  For the next 3 lessons after that, we talked about the kinds of people they met, and then they made posters about their favorite countries, and presented them to the class.</p><p>Overall, we spent 9 classes for Lesson 5...  which is a lot.  But it was worth it.</p><p>Anyway, that is the single most important thing I've about learning planning from my experience so far.  Think about your lessons like a good story.  Have a beginning, middle, and end.  Start simple, and build on that to a meaningful ultimate end.</p><p>Any questions?</p><div class='title'><b>ESA - Straight Arrow</b></div><p>But, the most important thing I learned from that TEFL course is how to do that within a single class.  And that is ESA.  ESA stands for Engage, Study, and Activate.</p><p>- E - Engage - S - Study - A - Activate</p><p>Shane is an education major, and he has fancier terms for these things, but I think these are easier to remember.  If you look at my lesson plan, those sections are renamed to Review, "Today's Aim", and Activity.  </p><p>The Engage stage gets the students active and involved in the lesson.  Many homeroom teachers that do the lesson planning use something called "ALT Time" where the ALT just talks about something referring to the lesson.  For example, today's class is about numbers, so please say numbers 1 through 10 in different languages.  Or, today's topic is about gestures, so show the students some gestures from your country.</p><p>I use the Engage stage for students to remember and use the contents of previous lessons, especially contents that we will build on and use in today's class.  Then we're all on the same page, and can continue to the next phase: Study.</p><p>The Study stage is the part of the lesson that teaches new things to the students.  For this part, I will write "Today's Aim" on the board in English, and explain the goal of today's class.  I will teach new words, or new grammar, or new ways to use the words or grammar they already should know.  I will explain things, and we will practice together as a class.  If we have time, I'll have them practice with their partner, too.</p><p>Next is the Activate stage.  This is where students get to use the language that has been taught to them.  I plan some kind of activity that allows for that.  Like for class #1, we're doing the keyword game where students practice speaking the vocabulary and some quick grammar, as well as listening and identifying vocabulary words.  Class #2 that activity is also more practicing and repeating.  Though, I think that activity is still within the Study phase, as it's teaching them about various countries.  My third class activity with very much an Activate Stage, though, as students interviewed each other, and they answered where they wanted to go, what they wanted to see, and what they wanted to eat.  Students could answer whatever they wanted, or chose from a list.</p><div class='title'><b>Predictability v Consistency</b></div><p>I would say 95% to 99% of all my classes use the straight arrow, Review-Study-Activity pattern.  Using the same pattern over and over again provides the students with a consistent model for class.  Consistency provides a safe and comfortable model for the class that the students and teachers subconsciously learn and expect.  They know exactly what your classes are about, and no longer have to worry, on any level, about the structure of class.  They can focus purely on the contents of what you actually want them to learn.</p><p>Predictability and Consistency are really just two sides of the same coin.  Though, it's always a good idea to change some things around to keep the students active, and test their abilities in different circumstances.  Don't feel constrained by any structure you've built. </p><div class='title'><b>Why I write lesson plans this way</b></div><p>There are numerous benefits to writing such detailed plans for your classes.</p><p>Back in the "Taking with the Teacher" section I mentioned that it's a great way to completely think through all the details of your lessons.  This irons out any problems you might think will happen during class, or during your activity.  You can think about how you will explain things to students, and the exact steps you think you'll need to accomplish your goals.  How will I do this?  What materials will I need?   What do I need the HRT to do to help me?  What do I need from the HRT to do this?  It's best to think about all these before class, rather than during.</p><p>Additionally, writing plans like this make you look more professional.  It brings you credibility, and makes you more of an equal among the teachers you will work with.  When they see the amount of work you've done planning and preparing a class, they will definitely listen to you more, and trust you with what's going on.  It shows that you're taking your job seriously and aren't slacking off, or doing the minimal amount of work to get by.  It shows that you're part of their team, and really do care about the education of your students.</p><p>And, also, writing plans this way is a great way of putting down all your thoughts on the lesson into one place, so you don't have to remember every detail about every lesson yourself.  I teach about 12 elementary school classes each week, and my schedule can be all over the place.  There's no way I can keep all those details in my head at a time.  Every morning, I can look at my plans for that day, grab all the materials I need from the list on the plan, and read everything over to make sure I don't forget a thing.  I can double check things during class, too.</p><p>It's the same case for the HRT, too.  They can look over their copies of the plan, and remember their role, and everything they need to do.</p><div class='title'><b>Conclusion</b></div><p>This is how I write my lesson plans, and my entire thought process about doing all of this.  It's the structure I've built to bring more meaning, and structure to my life as an ALT, and I've received many benefits from it.  I hope you able to take some pointers from the way I do things, and find your own structure that works for you.</p><p>Again, most ALTs don't do things this way at all.  This whole construct is something that is very much "me" so I don't expect anyone to look at this, and do things exactly this way.  It's important to find your own structure, and your own patterns, build them, perfect them, and share them with other ALTs.</p><p>I hope I was able to point in a direction that works for you.  Thanks. :D<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Event Party" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-adobe-max-event-party">Adobe Max Event Party</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Fully catered with food and beer!  The doors opened up around 6:30 or 7:00pm.</p><p>Inside the doors, you were escorted through a tunnel of light.  On the other side, you emerged within the 80s</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" /></p><p>You were inside of a massive hall that was sectioned into 3 separated eras of our past: the 80s, 90s and 00s.  In the air were the annoying sounds of the 80s.  In the middle of the hall, was a curtain that projected Ferris Beuler, and Back to the Future.  There were 8 flat panel screens setup playing Super Mario Brothers, Elevator Action, and several other Wii Virtual Console Titles.</p><p>Several other trinkets were placed all over the place too.  In the corner, they setup a retro arcade with Pacman, Tetris, Centipede, and Air Hockey.  You could also find a Delorion, Karaoke, Picture Booths and a couple other weird 80s things.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" /></p><p>There were plenty of things to eat as well.  You had your choice between hot dogs and macaroni & cheese.</p><p>The flow of the room forced you to go counter-clockwise, which brought you into the 90s.  That's pretty backward, actually.  If they had you move clockwise as the decade progressed, it would've made more sense.</p><p>In the 90s, the curtain displayed Britney spears, and off to the side were BMX bikers doing a bunch of tricks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" /></p><p>Caterers offered pizza and mini-burgers.  More Wii were setup as well, which offered Super Nintendo and Genesis titles for play.</p><p>Continuing along brought you into today.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" /></p><p>Immediately you were brought into the Texas Hold 'em den, where it was completely packed.  All the tables were full with adobe maxers betting fake cash against each other.  More flat panel TVs were setup, this time with Xbox 360s playing lanned Halo 3.  They also had a Segway obstacle course!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" /></p><p>For food, they offered mostly Asian buffet foods.</p><p>No matter which decade you were in, all the beers table offered the same variety, so, thank god, you didn't have to go searching for what you wanted.  I think it would've been different to pull off beers from the past two decades though, so maybe it was more of a limitation than a convenience.</p><p>Anyways, after grabbing a couple beers and some tasty food, I played some Halo 3 for a little while.  Unlike playing Halo online, most of the convention goers weren't die-hard fans, so I was actually able to hold my own for the majority of the time.</p><p>After a game or two, my co-workers caught up with me, so I joined in some more group oriented activities.  We played some air hockey, Super Mario, took some pictures in the photo booth, went back to Halo.  It was a great time, and the beer kept flowing ^_^</p><p>They eventually began kicking people out of the place, so the good times came to an end.  Not for too long though..  once we returned to our hotel, we parked ourselves in the hotel lobby's bar and continued the night.</p><div class='title'><b>Day Two in general</b></div><p>Sooo....  this is the main reason, why all these blog entries took so long to get up on the internet.  Day Two was completely jam-packed full of events from start to finish that I really didn't have a chance to start writing anything until later.</p><p>Overall, it was a great day, full of great sessions and great fun with great people.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - AdverGaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-advergaming">Adobe Max - AdverGaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>AdverGaming was all about how interactive gaming has spilled into online advertising and how you can catch the new wave. This session covers design and technical challenges inherent to making games for advertising campaigns. This discussion was lead by Sam Rivello, who is the director of Multimedia Development at NeoPets inc. He has designed over 400 flash and shockwave games developed for a youth oriented audience.</p><div class='title'><b>Casual Gaming</b></div><p>Rivello first stating what type of games are advergames. They are 100% casual games that require no long term commitment or special skills from the User. Casual games are meant for a mass audience and continue very few, and simple rules in order to play. Your game should lie within the 5-10 minute attention span of your audience.</p><p>Like all advertising, it should grab the User and keep them playing as long as possible, which means don't push details and information on the user. When a user thinks fun, they don't think about reading or something informational. Gaming is an immersive experience, so capture that.</p><div class='title'><b>Making an advergame</b></div><p>Rivello had 4 things that make an advergame an advergame.</p><p><i>Objective</i><br/>The main objective is to generate buzz and/or influence a purchase. An advergame is really an advertisement, so if you don't successful advertise your product, you have failed at making a successful advergame.</p><p><i>Target Audience</i><br/>The target audience of an advergame are teens between the ages of 12 and 17, so be sure to create your game for that audience. Teens are very active, so if your game is boring, then you're done. Capture the User and compel them to continue with your game.</p><p><i>Success Metrics</i></p><p><i>Timing</i><br/>An advergame is always timely and will always have strict deadlines that are along-side the product you're advertising. Being late with your game is unacceptable. Contrary to that, the lifespan of an advergame is incredibly short. Most of these games stay in the market between 1 and 6 months, so budget your time accordingly. Learn best practices and build an engine that you can switch out new characters and products with easily.</p><div class='title'><b>Proposal</b></div><p>Next, how do you sneak the idea of an advergame into your advertising proposal?</p><p>This was the part of the presentation where I simple nodded off.. This really didn't apply to me at all and it sounded a lot like a technical writing lecture than anything development related. Of course, designers and developers have to write, but this isn't helpful to me at the moment one bit.</p><p>I'm sure it's great information for those Flash developers that are trying to pull their animations into games, but I'm not a flash developer. I really don't care.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>and unfortunately, that's how this whole session ended for me. I was hoping to get inspired or learn some insight, but I gained neither from this presentation. I should have taken something more applicable and useful. Oh well.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Best Practices for Great Experiences" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-best-practices-for-great-web-experiences">Adobe Max - Best Practices for Great Experiences</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This was one of the premiere sessions hosted by the experience design, XD, team at Adobe, originally formed at Macromedia.  Andrew Lin lead this session and was a co-founder of this group.  "<em>As senior lead of XD, Lin drives the experience vision of next-generation of Creative Suite, namely Photoshop and Illustrator.  Working with engineering and product management teams, he is defining the Adobe Experience Model, a content-first interface approach for Adobe's desktop applications,</em>" says the Adobe Max website.</p><p>This session was all about what worked well for the XD team, and useful tips on how to improve the workflow of your own development team.</p><div class='title'><b>Team</b></div><p>After a bit of introductions, Lin went into what makes their team work and had 4 solid concepts they always think about for their staff.</p><p><em>Emphasis on making</em><br/>One of their main goals is to create great products, so they want their staff to have that natural inhibition to create something.</p><p><em>Generalists over specialists</em><br/>Their staff must have the overall vision of what they wish to achieve and not be bogged down by the details.  In order to reach the general audience, you must think in general terms.</p><p><em>Promote Trust and Freedom</em><br/>Innovation doesn't come by following orders, or coloring in the lines.  Real innovation comes from outside the box, and learning to trust your staff by giving them the freedom to go wild on a project is key in building an amazing product.</p><p><em>Have fun</em><br/>One of the biggest parts of their community is to have fun people to work with.  Being in a warm, playful environment is key to having a productive cohesive environment.  When choosing new members of the team, a candidate's personality outweighs their talent.</p><div class='title'><b>Process</b></div><p>Now that you've met the team, Lin went on to describe how they worked together.  Communication is crucial.  Your team needs to know what's going on with the project, and need to know they can get answers from anyone.  Having an open office without secrets and open communication promotes cohesion between everything you're working on.</p><p>Having an overall process is not that important.  Following a rigid structure only promotes stress and doesn't give your staff the flexibility and freedom to do what they want.  When you are free to be absorbed in your work, you'll get the best results ^_^</p><p>But that doesn't mean everyone can just screw around.  You must be very goal-oriented and always have focus on the end goal of your project.  With everyone working within your goals, your end user's goals will easily be met.</p><p>With these three concepts in mind, Lin gave us 5 rules for promoting a great working atmosphere.</p><p>1. <em>Simplify the problem</em>.  Never be too focused on one task that you lose sight of your real goal.  Learn to generalize and shrink the scope of your problem into steps.  Make it easy. ^_^</p><p>2. <em>Trust your instincts</em>.  Real experience cannot be read or taught, it is things you've found throughout the years, and with that knowledge you've surely encountered similar problems in the past.  If you think you're onto something, go with it.</p><p>3. <em>Share everything</em>.  The more other people know about your problem, the more knowledge you bring into the situation.  Having more eyes on a problem can find that solution you've been looking for.  Also, sharing your solutions with everybody will increase their knowledge on your overall project.</p><p>4. <em>Fail fast (to succeed sooner)</em>.  Always good advice.  If you're doing something wrong, it's best to know about it as soon as possible so you can correct the problem as soon as possible.</p><p>5. <em>We are all peers before the object</em>.  No one owns the project.  You are part of a team and as part of a team it is your responsibility to contribute to the project.  It's all about team work. ^_^</p><p>Before he finished up his tips, he stressed the importance of prototyping, prototyping, prototyping.  Always have a something to show your engineers and your customers to get the most amount of feedback possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Principles</b></div><p>This is the third component of their team:  How do they design.  Lin had 4 well organized principles they always keep in mind when designing their products.</p><p><em>What's your point?</em><br/>Having a <b>clear design objective</b> when beginning your project.  Know where you are going with it and what you hope to achieve by the end of your process.  Complete your <b>main tasks first</b>, before adding on any features.  That also goes along with <b>keeping it simple</b>.  Don't add a lot of unnecessary crap to your design.  (and) <b>Focus and emphasize</b> your main goals of your design.</p><p><em>Content is King</em><br/>Your design should be emphasize on your client's needs.  <b>Content before Chrome</b>.  <b>Provide flexibility</b> for the User to achieve their own goals with the product, while still adhering to the goals of your client.  Also, <b>enable direct manipulation</b>.. let the user do what they want.</p><p><em>Create an experience, not an interface</em><br/><b>Make it personal</b> for the user to give them a unique experience that they can take with them after using your product.  You've heard the expression 'less is more', but in practice <b>'just enough is more'</b>.  Adding in some key extras can put your design into excellence.  And be sure to <b>respond to your user</b>, rather than dictate.  Don't boss the user around, but guide them to their goals.</p><p><em>Choreograph sequence and flow</em><br/><b>Design as a whole</b>.  Be consist throughout your design and be sure to leave a trail for the User to follow.  <b>Establish a hierarchy</b> to let the user know the organization of your product.</p><p>(yeah, i kinda jammed everything together into paragraphs..)</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Like all presentations at this conference, Lin was running out of time so he tried to squish everything in as fast as possible toward the end (much like this blog post).</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, his concepts were quite sound and very helpful to everyone that attended.  It was boring as hell though, as Lin's persona really didn't seem to carry in his speech.  From the pictures he showed and practices he talked about, it sounded like it'd be a blast to work there, but a lot of his talk did seem to drag on.</p><p>It may have dragged on a bit because he was preaching to the choir on most of these points.  I found it rather amazing that nearly everything he recommended other teams to do, we had already done these things in my own development team at Widen.  As he went from point to point, I was mentally checking off things in my head, "yep, we do that..  yep, we do that, too"</p><p>Having a very cohesive team promotes a great environment that you can accomplish many goals both personal, professional, and for the company as well.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - What Makes Interfaces feel Intuitive?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-what-makes-an-interface-feel-intuitive">Adobe Max - What Makes Interfaces feel Intuitive?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Jared Spool is one of the most knowledgable people on the subject of User Interface.  According to the adobe max website, he's been working in the field of usability and design since 1978, before the term "usability" was ever associated with computers.  In 1988, Spool founded the <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">User Interface Engineering</a>, a firm that leads the world in research, training and consulting for website and product usability.  Check 'em out at <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">uie.com</a>.</p><p>Spool began his presentation with a simple example.  He presented that crowd with a simple request form for some hotel.  The form was quite standard, but two fields on this form were optional.  The company marked these with an asterisk with a comment above stating that the asterisk marked fields were optional.</p><p>However, Users that visited the site would have a very difficult time filling out this form.  Why did they have difficulty?  Because in our everyday visits to filling out forms, the asterisk implies 'mandatory', not 'optional'.  Nearly every registration or information form we fill out on the internet has this norm.  It was unintuitive to do it any other way.</p><p>Spool asks the crowd, "Who decided what an asterisk meant?  When did it become 'unintuitive' to do it differently?"  Most things in our life are done a very specific way and have been for some day, but who decided this?  This was Spool's opening statement, and the lecture to come would help to answer this.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>As a disclaimer, Spool begins setting straight a little bit of terminology.  The term 'design' is not something that can be intuitive.  Designs don't intuit anything, people do.  So calling a design "intuitive" is a shortcut.  He just wanted to get that out there, so during the rest of his lecture he could refer to the intuitiveness of a design, without causing confusion.</p><p>So, when is a design intuitive?  Well, we defintely know when a design is unintuitive.  This happens when we look at something and have no idea what to do.  Tasks take too long, and we grow increasingly frustrated with it.  We feel its the design's fault for our shortcomings.</p><div class='title'><b>The User</b></div><p>Being intuitive means beings personal.  To make a design we need to know our user.  What does the User currently know when coming into our design?  What previous experience does the User have with this kind of process?  Here's a little graph of the User's knowledge:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" /></p><p>The current knowledge is what the user already knows when coming into your design, and the target knowledge is what they need to know in order to fully understand your product.  In between these two points is the knowledge..  this is the leg-work you must provide your User to understand your system.  This is where the design happens.</p><div class='title'><b>Intuitive Design</b></div><p>Intuitive design is evolutionary.  Designer's first build the technology.  Over time more features are added to help the User and make things easier.  Changes in the design are made over time as well, which reduce complexity.  Throughout time as you tweak and perfect your design, it will become more and more intuitive to the User and you'll bring that target knowledge closer to the User's current knowledge.</p><p>So, when is design intuitive?  It's when one of two things are achieved.  Either (1) the current knowledge of your User is equal to the target knowledge required for your product.  In this case, the User already knows exactly what to do.  Or (2) the knowledge gap is very small.  The user can figure out the design of your product that they don't even know that they're learning.</p><div class='title'><b>Information Gathering</b></div><p>Spool gave us a couple common practices in getting to know your user better and understanding what they know.</p><p><em>Field Studies</em><br/>Surveying your Users can give you a good estimate on your audience's current knowledge.</p><p><em>Usability Studies</em><br/>Setting up focus groups and test sessions can help you identify your knowledge gap and give you good pointers on how you can reduce it early on.</p><p><em>Personas</em><br/>Identifying who your User is can put them in a familiar atmosphere when using your product.</p><p><em>Patterns</em><br/>Studying your user's patterns and current work flows will help you communicate knowledge to the user and shrink the knowledge gap.</p><div class='title'><b>Making things intuitive</b></div><p>Making things more intuitive is all about reducing the target knowledge and placing clues in your interface to steadilly increase your User's current knowledge.  One example he gave was to use error messages that actually help your user identify the problem!</p><p>Another example is the magic of wizards.  A wizard is a piece of your program that guides your user.  When done right, wizards instantly reduce the target knowledge of your product.  It supplements knowledge with technology, but never actually teaches the User.</p><p>When using a wizard, the target knowledge of the wizard must lie within the knowledge gap of your program.  Other wise, the User would be much better off without it.</p><p>Also think about reducing some of your workflow.  Figure out what is really necessary in your design and what isn't.  If you have a bunch of unneccesary features or steps, get rid of them.  Makes things as simple for the user as possible.  Make sure your program matches the user's goals.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Unfortunately, Spool began to run out of time and was hurried up towards the end but he left us with some main points he wanted us to take away.</p><p>Intuitive is personal.<br/>Intuitive happens when the knowledge gap is minimized.<br/>and just because you know how to work your program, doesn't mean the user does.</p><p>Always remember that last one.  You've built this program, you've designed and know all about it.  Everything in the program is obvious to you, so don't think that it's completely obvious to the average user.  You current knowledge of your program is far beyond the current knowledge of your user.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Out of the conference, this session belongs in my top 3 favorite moments from Adobe Max.  Not only was this session full of rich information, but Jared Spool is a hilarious guy.  It's rather interesting that his well placed humor throughout the lecture was really what engaged the audience into all the information he presented, much like well placed hints and tool tips within your program will engage your user.</p><p>You couldn't help but learn, and I felt I left this session learning quite a bit.  Definitely look for this guy at any designer or developer conference you should find yourself at.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day 2 Keynote by Kevin Lynch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch">Adobe Max Day 2 Keynote by Kevin Lynch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After the first session of day two, everyone came back to the General Session room for a the second half of Adobe's keynote to the attendees. This was more of the previous day's self serving adobe update for everyone. The first day's keynote was about what we've done with Adobe, and today was about what Adobe is doing for us.</p><div class='title'><b>Bruce Chizen speaks</b></div><p>As a huge surprise, current CEO of Adobe, Bruce Chizen, took the stage and addressed the crowd. He began to talk about how hard is to be mister big bad CEO of a large company. Yeah.. poor him and his million dollar salary. But his speech ended on a good note. The whole slogan of Adobe Max is to Connect, Discover and Inspire. He thought it was great to see so many people inspired by the works of others and to connect with each and spread the word of Adobe.</p><p>Chizen explained that even though their job was to Inspire, it is truly us.. the designers and developers that inspire Adobe to make these products in the first place. Adobe is our instrument to create, and in turn, we are their instrument to create.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest..</b></div><p>The rest of the speech talked about Servers, Services and Tools of current Adobe. The only service that was truly amazing was Scene 7. This is a Image Server that converts images in realtime. You host an image on this server, and you can send it any number of parameters that will change the image on the fly. Extremely helpful for generating previews and being able to zoom in on online photos.</p><p>The other interesting thing in the rest of the speech was a new tool called <b>Thermo</b>. Thermo is a new Adobe program that will generate a running Flex application from importing a Photoshop document.</p><p>In this day and age, nearly all websites are mocked up in Photoshop. Once the design is done, you begin coding this thing in HTML and CSS to make it move and work the way you'd like. Thermo cuts out this step by creating the page for you. Simply import that Photoshop document and the page is creating. Of course, you'll need to do a little bit of editing to make things work.</p><p>Textbox? If you've mocked up a text box on your page, right click your input box and sample text and click on 'convert to textbox'. BAM, you've got a textbox that's completely operational and retains the text information from the sample text.</p><p>Next up was a List View complete with scroll bar and sample data. He had one of these all mocked up on his page, but with a simple right click with the sample images selected.. BAM, you've got a list of objects. You can adjust the margins of these images, and use a time-line to create roll over effects. Pretty snazzy! All using the UI.</p><p>Next up was the scroll bar. He had one of those mocked up underneath these images. With more right clicking on those components, BAM.. you've got a scroll bar. You have to specify which object is the scroll bar, the arrows, and the container though. But wait.. how does the scroll bar know which data it's looking at? Simply move a little handle over to the list and BAM. The scrollbar now works with the list!</p><p>In 20 minutes, you've already mocked up all the basic functionality of the website with actual Flex code behind it. You can easily deploy this thing for client, no problem..</p><p>Well, i'm sure you've already seen the problem with this.. The code generated by this program has got to be the most god awful, unmaintainable code in existence. Do you remember when Dreamweaver first came out? All the CSS was inline and it did not tear down any tags it created. A coder would shoot himself before ever trying to make a change on that pile of shit.</p><p>Way to go Thermo! Let's usher in a new age of horrible web code that will create more problems than it solves.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>That was about all I got out of that session. Scene 7 is bad ass, Thermo is ass bad. Of course, all the designers shit their pants when they did anything with Thermo. The gasps in the audience were really disheartening..</p><p>It reminds me of a quote said by Ted Neward of Java fame.. "You should always under stand one level of abstraction below of where you are working" Meaning, if you design a webpage, you better be damn sure you know HTML and CSS. If you develop JavaScript, you better be damn sure you know about DOM objects and Browser differences. If you don't know the abstract you're building on top of, then you have no right to develop on it.</p><p>So, if you're using Thermo and you don't know Flex.. don't even touch the thing. Learn Flex concepts and some syntax, and then begin developing your UI in Thermo. You'll probably see just how horrible a program it is and thank yourself in the end.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Take the Web to the next Dimension" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-take-the-web-to-the-next-dimension">Adobe Max - Take the Web to the next Dimension</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

He grew to be a lead developer at Psygnosis during the mid-90s before they were completely absorbed by Sony in 1999. Carlos went on to do Flash development with several advertising companies until he eventually started his own company built on Flash that came off the ground with Papervision 3d.</p><p>Carlos and his pals are responsible for creating this wonderful open source Flash library which makes 3d development in Flash quite understandable and easy for those familar with using 3d tools such as Maya and 3ds max, and easy for those that know Flash too.</p><p>Let me say.. I accomplished another one of my life goals that day when I shook the hand of a man responsible for Wipeout XL and Wipeout 3. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Realtime v. Pre-rendered</b></div><p>Interaction is the base of an engaging experience. These are the moments that make a User's experience unique. You engage a medium and that results in a reward. In other terms, interaction will result in content. To make an engaging experience you must use input to render an output in realtime. That's where we're at today.</p><p>A Realtime experience is active, responsive, flexible, customizable, and different every time. It's exciting compared to the previous step in motion graphics: Prerendered movies or pictures. A prerendered experience is passive, unresponsive, rigid, static, and repetitive. Overall, it's boring. You want to make something unique, and video games has really been at the cutting edge of making a unique experience.</p><p>Video Games lead computing innovation both in Hardware and Software. As video games began to mature we saw the advent of Full Motion video. CD-Roms were developed to hold this full-motion video as floppy disks simply could not contain that amount of data.</p><p>Realtime 3d was next. The Playstation revolutionized gaming designing their hardware specifically for rendering 3d imagery on the fly. Once 3d took the gaming world by storm, Prerendered movies were a thing of the past. "Skip Intro" began a coined phrase in most games.</p><p>Throughout the past 12 years of the Playstation, we're finally getting to the point where prerendered backgrounds ARE a thing of the past. Realtime rendered 3d can look just as good as any prerendered intro sequence, so most games don't even do them anymore. These two paths of motion graphics are finally converging to a single point.</p><div class='title'><b>The Web</b></div><p>Interactivity of the Internet is lead by Flash development. Flash player 9 in the standard of internet gaming with new features such as ActionScript 3, multi-threading, optimized rendering, and full screen modes that don't degrade your flash file. Flash has a very healthy open source community that is by flash developers, for flash developers.</p><p>That's like another 'duh' statement, isn't it? What he means by a flash open source community by devs for devs, is that most Flash open source projects are entirely independent. Many other open source community for other programming languages can be heavily commercialized with their funding provided by certain companies pushing their open source product.</p><p>At this point he unveiled his own open source project, Papervision 3d. Papervision 3d is an open source realtime 3d engine for Flash. It supports ActionScript versions 2 and 3. It is extremely powerful in terms of performance, flexibility, and expandability. It's very easy to use since ActionScript 3 has made many strides in ease as well. It has built-in Asset management. (and) Papervision also uses COLLADA which will allow you to import your models and textures from Maya, 3ds Max and other 3d programs.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Practices</b></div><p>Carlos went on to describe how development is changing with the current trends of motion graphics. The old model of software development is very time-line.. this is where you start off Designing everything. During the design phase you begin production. Production would be.. i dunno. I don't quite remember. Once you're done designing, then you begin developing, and once you're done developing that when the artists come in and make up the prerender video to fill in the gaps between levels.</p><p>This process doesn't seem very efficient at all.. It doesn't really make much sense to me either :/.. Next up he unveiled how the trends will shape this software development model.</p><p>Designing and developing will start from the very beginning. Production will still take part in the middle, however development will last throughout the whole time-line. Once Design ends, the artists will take control and work with the developers up through the end.</p><p>His whole point from these development models is that artists are becoming essential to the development of your game. You need artists creating models and levels, while your development team is working on the engine and physics. Both need to flow together to make an cohesive experience.</p><div class='title'><b>Budgeting</b></div><p>He continued on to discuss how budgeting for games have been to see a renaissance. Last generation, Art would find itself taking up 50% of the budget, with 30% for design and 20% for development. With 3d development, you needed people creating all the 3d models in the game, the levels, and making up for lack of technology like lighting effects. Artists had their work cut out for them to make 3d look believable..</p><p>These days, development is on the rise again. We have the technology to build renderable engines to make shadows and lighting effects look very believable without clever texturing tricks. Development, Design, and Art will grow to have an equal slice of the budget pie.</p><div class='title'><b>Use of 3d</b></div><p>Next, Carlos went on to describe the 4 most common uses of 3d in any medium.</p><p><i>Transitions</i> are moving from one 2d space to another through 3d.<br/><i>Navigation</i> is moving around a 3d space until arriving at a 2d space.<br/><i>Exploration</i> is moving around in 3d.<br/><i>Customization</i> is changing textures on 3d objects.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next for Papervision?</b></div><p>For the next version of papervision there are trying to include Full environments and skeletons. Full environments would include composition and camera work, compared to using the one-camera-centric stage that Flash begins with. With skeletons, they're looking at including Inverse Kinematics or Motion Capture for movement of human models. Also ASCOLLADA to import skeletons and animations from Maya and 3ds Max.</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>To conclude, he discussed where he gets his inspiration from. Games can inspire you into making a game, menu, or UI. Demos can inspire you into Special Effects. Motion Graphics can inspire composition and camera work. (and) Film and TV can inspire classic film making concepts. All these concepts are vital to creating 3d, so don't be adverse to sampling everything out there.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I thought this was a great presentation, but it really wasn't in my field of work. Papervision is a very powerful tool and hopefully more Flash developers will begin to adopt it so we can see more amazing things in the future ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/conferences/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (35)
