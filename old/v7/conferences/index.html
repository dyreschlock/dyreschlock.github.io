Fully catered with food and beer!  The doors opened up around 6:30 or 7:00pm.</p><p>Inside the doors, you were escorted through a tunnel of light.  On the other side, you emerged within the 80s</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" /></p><p>You were inside of a massive hall that was sectioned into 3 separated eras of our past: the 80s, 90s and 00s.  In the air were the annoying sounds of the 80s.  In the middle of the hall, was a curtain that projected Ferris Beuler, and Back to the Future.  There were 8 flat panel screens setup playing Super Mario Brothers, Elevator Action, and several other Wii Virtual Console Titles.</p><p>Several other trinkets were placed all over the place too.  In the corner, they setup a retro arcade with Pacman, Tetris, Centipede, and Air Hockey.  You could also find a Delorion, Karaoke, Picture Booths and a couple other weird 80s things.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" /></p><p>There were plenty of things to eat as well.  You had your choice between hot dogs and macaroni & cheese.</p><p>The flow of the room forced you to go counter-clockwise, which brought you into the 90s.  That's pretty backward, actually.  If they had you move clockwise as the decade progressed, it would've made more sense.</p><p>In the 90s, the curtain displayed Britney spears, and off to the side were BMX bikers doing a bunch of tricks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" /></p><p>Caterers offered pizza and mini-burgers.  More Wii were setup as well, which offered Super Nintendo and Genesis titles for play.</p><p>Continuing along brought you into today.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0568.webp" /></p><p>Immediately you were brought into the Texas Hold 'em den, where it was completely packed.  All the tables were full with adobe maxers betting fake cash against each other.  More flat panel TVs were setup, this time with Xbox 360s playing lanned Halo 3.  They also had a Segway obstacle course!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" /></p><p>For food, they offered mostly Asian buffet foods.</p><p>No matter which decade you were in, all the beers table offered the same variety, so, thank god, you didn't have to go searching for what you wanted.  I think it would've been different to pull off beers from the past two decades though, so maybe it was more of a limitation than a convenience.</p><p>Anyways, after grabbing a couple beers and some tasty food, I played some Halo 3 for a little while.  Unlike playing Halo online, most of the convention goers weren't die-hard fans, so I was actually able to hold my own for the majority of the time.</p><p>After a game or two, my co-workers caught up with me, so I joined in some more group oriented activities.  We played some air hockey, Super Mario, took some pictures in the photo booth, went back to Halo.  It was a great time, and the beer kept flowing ^_^</p><p>They eventually began kicking people out of the place, so the good times came to an end.  Not for too long though..  once we returned to our hotel, we parked ourselves in the hotel lobby's bar and continued the night.</p><div class='title'><b>Day Two in general</b></div><p>Sooo....  this is the main reason, why all these blog entries took so long to get up on the internet.  Day Two was completely jam-packed full of events from start to finish that I really didn't have a chance to start writing anything until later.</p><p>Overall, it was a great day, full of great sessions and great fun with great people.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day Two - AdverGaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-advergaming">Adobe Max Day Two - AdverGaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>AdverGaming was all about how interactive gaming has spilled into online advertising and how you can catch the new wave. This session covers design and technical challenges inherent to making games for advertising campaigns. This discussion was lead by Sam Rivello, who is the director of Multimedia Development at NeoPets inc. He has designed over 400 flash and shockwave games developed for a youth oriented audience.</p><div class='title'><b>Casual Gaming</b></div><p>Rivello first stating what type of games are advergames. They are 100% casual games that require no long term commitment or special skills from the User. Casual games are meant for a mass audience and continue very few, and simple rules in order to play. Your game should lie within the 5-10 minute attention span of your audience.</p><p>Like all advertising, it should grab the User and keep them playing as long as possible, which means don't push details and information on the user. When a user thinks fun, they don't think about reading or something informational. Gaming is an immersive experience, so capture that.</p><div class='title'><b>Making an advergame</b></div><p>Rivello had 4 things that make an advergame an advergame.</p><p><i>Objective</i><br/>The main objective is to generate buzz and/or influence a purchase. An advergame is really an advertisement, so if you don't successful advertise your product, you have failed at making a successful advergame.</p><p><i>Target Audience</i><br/>The target audience of an advergame are teens between the ages of 12 and 17, so be sure to create your game for that audience. Teens are very active, so if your game is boring, then you're done. Capture the User and compel them to continue with your game.</p><p><i>Success Metrics</i></p><p><i>Timing</i><br/>An advergame is always timely and will always have strict deadlines that are along-side the product you're advertising. Being late with your game is unacceptable. Contrary to that, the lifespan of an advergame is incredibly short. Most of these games stay in the market between 1 and 6 months, so budget your time accordingly. Learn best practices and build an engine that you can switch out new characters and products with easily.</p><div class='title'><b>Proposal</b></div><p>Next, how do you sneak the idea of an advergame into your advertising proposal?</p><p>This was the part of the presentation where I simple nodded off.. This really didn't apply to me at all and it sounded a lot like a technical writing lecture than anything development related. Of course, designers and developers have to write, but this isn't helpful to me at the moment one bit.</p><p>I'm sure it's great information for those Flash developers that are trying to pull their animations into games, but I'm not a flash developer. I really don't care.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>and unfortunately, that's how this whole session ended for me. I was hoping to get inspired or learn some insight, but I gained neither from this presentation. I should have taken something more applicable and useful. Oh well.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day Two - Best Practices for Great Web Experiences" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-best-practices-for-great-web-experiences">Adobe Max Day Two - Best Practices for Great Web Experiences</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This was one of the premiere sessions hosted by the experience design, XD, team at Adobe, originally formed at Macromedia.  Andrew Lin lead this session and was a co-founder of this group.  "<em>As senior lead of XD, Lin drives the experience vision of next-generation of Creative Suite, namely Photoshop and Illustrator.  Working with engineering and product management teams, he is defining the Adobe Experience Model, a content-first interface approach for Adobe's desktop applications,</em>" says the Adobe Max website.</p><p>This session was all about what worked well for the XD team, and useful tips on how to improve the workflow of your own development team.</p><div class='title'><b>Team</b></div><p>After a bit of introductions, Lin went into what makes their team work and had 4 solid concepts they always think about for their staff.</p><p><em>Emphasis on making</em><br/>One of their main goals is to create great products, so they want their staff to have that natural inhibition to create something.</p><p><em>Generalists over specialists</em><br/>Their staff must have the overall vision of what they wish to achieve and not be bogged down by the details.  In order to reach the general audience, you must think in general terms.</p><p><em>Promote Trust and Freedom</em><br/>Innovation doesn't come by following orders, or coloring in the lines.  Real innovation comes from outside the box, and learning to trust your staff by giving them the freedom to go wild on a project is key in building an amazing product.</p><p><em>Have fun</em><br/>One of the biggest parts of their community is to have fun people to work with.  Being in a warm, playful environment is key to having a productive cohesive environment.  When choosing new members of the team, a candidate's personality outweighs their talent.</p><div class='title'><b>Process</b></div><p>Now that you've met the team, Lin went on to describe how they worked together.  Communication is crucial.  Your team needs to know what's going on with the project, and need to know they can get answers from anyone.  Having an open office without secrets and open communication promotes cohesion between everything you're working on.</p><p>Having an overall process is not that important.  Following a rigid structure only promotes stress and doesn't give your staff the flexibility and freedom to do what they want.  When you are free to be absorbed in your work, you'll get the best results ^_^</p><p>But that doesn't mean everyone can just screw around.  You must be very goal-oriented and always have focus on the end goal of your project.  With everyone working within your goals, your end user's goals will easily be met.</p><p>With these three concepts in mind, Lin gave us 5 rules for promoting a great working atmosphere.</p><p>1. <em>Simplify the problem</em>.  Never be too focused on one task that you lose sight of your real goal.  Learn to generalize and shrink the scope of your problem into steps.  Make it easy. ^_^</p><p>2. <em>Trust your instincts</em>.  Real experience cannot be read or taught, it is things you've found throughout the years, and with that knowledge you've surely encountered similar problems in the past.  If you think you're onto something, go with it.</p><p>3. <em>Share everything</em>.  The more other people know about your problem, the more knowledge you bring into the situation.  Having more eyes on a problem can find that solution you've been looking for.  Also, sharing your solutions with everybody will increase their knowledge on your overall project.</p><p>4. <em>Fail fast (to succeed sooner)</em>.  Always good advice.  If you're doing something wrong, it's best to know about it as soon as possible so you can correct the problem as soon as possible.</p><p>5. <em>We are all peers before the object</em>.  No one owns the project.  You are part of a team and as part of a team it is your responsibility to contribute to the project.  It's all about team work. ^_^</p><p>Before he finished up his tips, he stressed the importance of prototyping, prototyping, prototyping.  Always have a something to show your engineers and your customers to get the most amount of feedback possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Principles</b></div><p>This is the third component of their team:  How do they design.  Lin had 4 well organized principles they always keep in mind when designing their products.</p><p><em>What's your point?</em><br/>Having a <b>clear design objective</b> when beginning your project.  Know where you are going with it and what you hope to achieve by the end of your process.  Complete your <b>main tasks first</b>, before adding on any features.  That also goes along with <b>keeping it simple</b>.  Don't add a lot of unnecessary crap to your design.  (and) <b>Focus and emphasize</b> your main goals of your design.</p><p><em>Content is King</em><br/>Your design should be emphasize on your client's needs.  <b>Content before Chrome</b>.  <b>Provide flexibility</b> for the User to achieve their own goals with the product, while still adhering to the goals of your client.  Also, <b>enable direct manipulation</b>.. let the user do what they want.</p><p><em>Create an experience, not an interface</em><br/><b>Make it personal</b> for the user to give them a unique experience that they can take with them after using your product.  You've heard the expression 'less is more', but in practice <b>'just enough is more'</b>.  Adding in some key extras can put your design into excellence.  And be sure to <b>respond to your user</b>, rather than dictate.  Don't boss the user around, but guide them to their goals.</p><p><em>Choreograph sequence and flow</em><br/><b>Design as a whole</b>.  Be consist throughout your design and be sure to leave a trail for the User to follow.  <b>Establish a hierarchy</b> to let the user know the organization of your product.</p><p>(yeah, i kinda jammed everything together into paragraphs..)</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Like all presentations at this conference, Lin was running out of time so he tried to squish everything in as fast as possible toward the end (much like this blog post).</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, his concepts were quite sound and very helpful to everyone that attended.  It was boring as hell though, as Lin's persona really didn't seem to carry in his speech.  From the pictures he showed and practices he talked about, it sounded like it'd be a blast to work there, but a lot of his talk did seem to drag on.</p><p>It may have dragged on a bit because he was preaching to the choir on most of these points.  I found it rather amazing that nearly everything he recommended other teams to do, we had already done these things in my own development team at Widen.  As he went from point to point, I was mentally checking off things in my head, "yep, we do that..  yep, we do that, too"</p><p>Having a very cohesive team promotes a great environment that you can accomplish many goals both personal, professional, and for the company as well.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day Two - What Makes an Interface feel Intuitive?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-what-makes-an-interface-feel-intuitive">Adobe Max Day Two - What Makes an Interface feel Intuitive?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Jared Spool is one of the most knowledgable people on the subject of User Interface.  According to the adobe max website, he's been working in the field of usability and design since 1978, before the term "usability" was ever associated with computers.  In 1988, Spool founded the <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">User Interface Engineering</a>, a firm that leads the world in research, training and consulting for website and product usability.  Check 'em out at <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">uie.com</a>.</p><p>Spool began his presentation with a simple example.  He presented that crowd with a simple request form for some hotel.  The form was quite standard, but two fields on this form were optional.  The company marked these with an asterisk with a comment above stating that the asterisk marked fields were optional.</p><p>However, Users that visited the site would have a very difficult time filling out this form.  Why did they have difficulty?  Because in our everyday visits to filling out forms, the asterisk implies 'mandatory', not 'optional'.  Nearly every registration or information form we fill out on the internet has this norm.  It was unintuitive to do it any other way.</p><p>Spool asks the crowd, "Who decided what an asterisk meant?  When did it become 'unintuitive' to do it differently?"  Most things in our life are done a very specific way and have been for some day, but who decided this?  This was Spool's opening statement, and the lecture to come would help to answer this.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>As a disclaimer, Spool begins setting straight a little bit of terminology.  The term 'design' is not something that can be intuitive.  Designs don't intuit anything, people do.  So calling a design "intuitive" is a shortcut.  He just wanted to get that out there, so during the rest of his lecture he could refer to the intuitiveness of a design, without causing confusion.</p><p>So, when is a design intuitive?  Well, we defintely know when a design is unintuitive.  This happens when we look at something and have no idea what to do.  Tasks take too long, and we grow increasingly frustrated with it.  We feel its the design's fault for our shortcomings.</p><div class='title'><b>The User</b></div><p>Being intuitive means beings personal.  To make a design we need to know our user.  What does the User currently know when coming into our design?  What previous experience does the User have with this kind of process?  Here's a little graph of the User's knowledge:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" /></p><p>The current knowledge is what the user already knows when coming into your design, and the target knowledge is what they need to know in order to fully understand your product.  In between these two points is the knowledge..  this is the leg-work you must provide your User to understand your system.  This is where the design happens.</p><div class='title'><b>Intuitive Design</b></div><p>Intuitive design is evolutionary.  Designer's first build the technology.  Over time more features are added to help the User and make things easier.  Changes in the design are made over time as well, which reduce complexity.  Throughout time as you tweak and perfect your design, it will become more and more intuitive to the User and you'll bring that target knowledge closer to the User's current knowledge.</p><p>So, when is design intuitive?  It's when one of two things are achieved.  Either (1) the current knowledge of your User is equal to the target knowledge required for your product.  In this case, the User already knows exactly what to do.  Or (2) the knowledge gap is very small.  The user can figure out the design of your product that they don't even know that they're learning.</p><div class='title'><b>Information Gathering</b></div><p>Spool gave us a couple common practices in getting to know your user better and understanding what they know.</p><p><em>Field Studies</em><br/>Surveying your Users can give you a good estimate on your audience's current knowledge.</p><p><em>Usability Studies</em><br/>Setting up focus groups and test sessions can help you identify your knowledge gap and give you good pointers on how you can reduce it early on.</p><p><em>Personas</em><br/>Identifying who your User is can put them in a familiar atmosphere when using your product.</p><p><em>Patterns</em><br/>Studying your user's patterns and current work flows will help you communicate knowledge to the user and shrink the knowledge gap.</p><div class='title'><b>Making things intuitive</b></div><p>Making things more intuitive is all about reducing the target knowledge and placing clues in your interface to steadilly increase your User's current knowledge.  One example he gave was to use error messages that actually help your user identify the problem!</p><p>Another example is the magic of wizards.  A wizard is a piece of your program that guides your user.  When done right, wizards instantly reduce the target knowledge of your product.  It supplements knowledge with technology, but never actually teaches the User.</p><p>When using a wizard, the target knowledge of the wizard must lie within the knowledge gap of your program.  Other wise, the User would be much better off without it.</p><p>Also think about reducing some of your workflow.  Figure out what is really necessary in your design and what isn't.  If you have a bunch of unneccesary features or steps, get rid of them.  Makes things as simple for the user as possible.  Make sure your program matches the user's goals.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Unfortunately, Spool began to run out of time and was hurried up towards the end but he left us with some main points he wanted us to take away.</p><p>Intuitive is personal.<br/>Intuitive happens when the knowledge gap is minimized.<br/>and just because you know how to work your program, doesn't mean the user does.</p><p>Always remember that last one.  You've built this program, you've designed and know all about it.  Everything in the program is obvious to you, so don't think that it's completely obvious to the average user.  You current knowledge of your program is far beyond the current knowledge of your user.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Out of the conference, this session belongs in my top 3 favorite moments from Adobe Max.  Not only was this session full of rich information, but Jared Spool is a hilarious guy.  It's rather interesting that his well placed humor throughout the lecture was really what engaged the audience into all the information he presented, much like well placed hints and tool tips within your program will engage your user.</p><p>You couldn't help but learn, and I felt I left this session learning quite a bit.  Definitely look for this guy at any designer or developer conference you should find yourself at.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day Two - General Session Keynote by Kevin Lynch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch">Adobe Max Day Two - General Session Keynote by Kevin Lynch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>After the first session of day two, everyone came back to the General Session room for a the second half of Adobe's keynote to the attendees. This was more of the previous day's self serving adobe update for everyone. The first day's keynote was about what we've done with Adobe, and today was about what Adobe is doing for us.</p><div class='title'><b>Bruce Chizen speaks</b></div><p>As a huge surprise, current CEO of Adobe, Bruce Chizen, took the stage and addressed the crowd. He began to talk about how hard is to be mister big bad CEO of a large company. Yeah.. poor him and his million dollar salary. But his speech ended on a good note. The whole slogan of Adobe Max is to Connect, Discover and Inspire. He thought it was great to see so many people inspired by the works of others and to connect with each and spread the word of Adobe.</p><p>Chizen explained that even though their job was to Inspire, it is truly us.. the designers and developers that inspire Adobe to make these products in the first place. Adobe is our instrument to create, and in turn, we are their instrument to create.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest..</b></div><p>The rest of the speech talked about Servers, Services and Tools of current Adobe. The only service that was truly amazing was Scene 7. This is a Image Server that converts images in realtime. You host an image on this server, and you can send it any number of parameters that will change the image on the fly. Extremely helpful for generating previews and being able to zoom in on online photos.</p><p>The other interesting thing in the rest of the speech was a new tool called <b>Thermo</b>. Thermo is a new Adobe program that will generate a running Flex application from importing a Photoshop document.</p><p>In this day and age, nearly all websites are mocked up in Photoshop. Once the design is done, you begin coding this thing in HTML and CSS to make it move and work the way you'd like. Thermo cuts out this step by creating the page for you. Simply import that Photoshop document and the page is creating. Of course, you'll need to do a little bit of editing to make things work.</p><p>Textbox? If you've mocked up a text box on your page, right click your input box and sample text and click on 'convert to textbox'. BAM, you've got a textbox that's completely operational and retains the text information from the sample text.</p><p>Next up was a List View complete with scroll bar and sample data. He had one of these all mocked up on his page, but with a simple right click with the sample images selected.. BAM, you've got a list of objects. You can adjust the margins of these images, and use a time-line to create roll over effects. Pretty snazzy! All using the UI.</p><p>Next up was the scroll bar. He had one of those mocked up underneath these images. With more right clicking on those components, BAM.. you've got a scroll bar. You have to specify which object is the scroll bar, the arrows, and the container though. But wait.. how does the scroll bar know which data it's looking at? Simply move a little handle over to the list and BAM. The scrollbar now works with the list!</p><p>In 20 minutes, you've already mocked up all the basic functionality of the website with actual Flex code behind it. You can easily deploy this thing for client, no problem..</p><p>Well, i'm sure you've already seen the problem with this.. The code generated by this program has got to be the most god awful, unmaintainable code in existence. Do you remember when Dreamweaver first came out? All the CSS was inline and it did not tear down any tags it created. A coder would shoot himself before ever trying to make a change on that pile of shit.</p><p>Way to go Thermo! Let's usher in a new age of horrible web code that will create more problems than it solves.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>That was about all I got out of that session. Scene 7 is bad ass, Thermo is ass bad. Of course, all the designers shit their pants when they did anything with Thermo. The gasps in the audience were really disheartening..</p><p>It reminds me of a quote said by Ted Neward of Java fame.. "You should always under stand one level of abstraction below of where you are working" Meaning, if you design a webpage, you better be damn sure you know HTML and CSS. If you develop JavaScript, you better be damn sure you know about DOM objects and Browser differences. If you don't know the abstract you're building on top of, then you have no right to develop on it.</p><p>So, if you're using Thermo and you don't know Flex.. don't even touch the thing. Learn Flex concepts and some syntax, and then begin developing your UI in Thermo. You'll probably see just how horrible a program it is and thank yourself in the end.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day Two - Take the Web to the next Dimension" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-two-take-the-web-to-the-next-dimension">Adobe Max Day Two - Take the Web to the next Dimension</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Carlos Ulloa is seasoned developer. He grew to be a lead developer at Psygnosis during the mid-90s before they were completely absorbed by Sony in 1999. Carlos went on to do Flash development with several advertising companies until he eventually started his own company built on Flash that came off the ground with Papervision 3d.</p><p>Carlos and his pals are responsible for creating this wonderful open source Flash library which makes 3d development in Flash quite understandable and easy for those familar with using 3d tools such as Maya and 3ds max, and easy for those that know Flash too.</p><p>Let me say.. I accomplished another one of my life goals that day when I shook the hand of a man responsible for Wipeout XL and Wipeout 3. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Realtime v. Pre-rendered</b></div><p>Interaction is the base of an engaging experience. These are the moments that make a User's experience unique. You engage a medium and that results in a reward. In other terms, interaction will result in content. To make an engaging experience you must use input to render an output in realtime. That's where we're at today.</p><p>A Realtime experience is active, responsive, flexible, customizable, and different every time. It's exciting compared to the previous step in motion graphics: Prerendered movies or pictures. A prerendered experience is passive, unresponsive, rigid, static, and repetitive. Overall, it's boring. You want to make something unique, and video games has really been at the cutting edge of making a unique experience.</p><p>Video Games lead computing innovation both in Hardware and Software. As video games began to mature we saw the advent of Full Motion video. CD-Roms were developed to hold this full-motion video as floppy disks simply could not contain that amount of data.</p><p>Realtime 3d was next. The Playstation revolutionized gaming designing their hardware specifically for rendering 3d imagery on the fly. Once 3d took the gaming world by storm, Prerendered movies were a thing of the past. "Skip Intro" began a coined phrase in most games.</p><p>Throughout the past 12 years of the Playstation, we're finally getting to the point where prerendered backgrounds ARE a thing of the past. Realtime rendered 3d can look just as good as any prerendered intro sequence, so most games don't even do them anymore. These two paths of motion graphics are finally converging to a single point.</p><div class='title'><b>The Web</b></div><p>Interactivity of the Internet is lead by Flash development. Flash player 9 in the standard of internet gaming with new features such as ActionScript 3, multi-threading, optimized rendering, and full screen modes that don't degrade your flash file. Flash has a very healthy open source community that is by flash developers, for flash developers.</p><p>That's like another 'duh' statement, isn't it? What he means by a flash open source community by devs for devs, is that most Flash open source projects are entirely independent. Many other open source community for other programming languages can be heavily commercialized with their funding provided by certain companies pushing their open source product.</p><p>At this point he unveiled his own open source project, Papervision 3d. Papervision 3d is an open source realtime 3d engine for Flash. It supports ActionScript versions 2 and 3. It is extremely powerful in terms of performance, flexibility, and expandability. It's very easy to use since ActionScript 3 has made many strides in ease as well. It has built-in Asset management. (and) Papervision also uses COLLADA which will allow you to import your models and textures from Maya, 3ds Max and other 3d programs.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Practices</b></div><p>Carlos went on to describe how development is changing with the current trends of motion graphics. The old model of software development is very time-line.. this is where you start off Designing everything. During the design phase you begin production. Production would be.. i dunno. I don't quite remember. Once you're done designing, then you begin developing, and once you're done developing that when the artists come in and make up the prerender video to fill in the gaps between levels.</p><p>This process doesn't seem very efficient at all.. It doesn't really make much sense to me either :/.. Next up he unveiled how the trends will shape this software development model.</p><p>Designing and developing will start from the very beginning. Production will still take part in the middle, however development will last throughout the whole time-line. Once Design ends, the artists will take control and work with the developers up through the end.</p><p>His whole point from these development models is that artists are becoming essential to the development of your game. You need artists creating models and levels, while your development team is working on the engine and physics. Both need to flow together to make an cohesive experience.</p><div class='title'><b>Budgeting</b></div><p>He continued on to discuss how budgeting for games have been to see a renaissance. Last generation, Art would find itself taking up 50% of the budget, with 30% for design and 20% for development. With 3d development, you needed people creating all the 3d models in the game, the levels, and making up for lack of technology like lighting effects. Artists had their work cut out for them to make 3d look believable..</p><p>These days, development is on the rise again. We have the technology to build renderable engines to make shadows and lighting effects look very believable without clever texturing tricks. Development, Design, and Art will grow to have an equal slice of the budget pie.</p><div class='title'><b>Use of 3d</b></div><p>Next, Carlos went on to describe the 4 most common uses of 3d in any medium.</p><p><i>Transitions</i> are moving from one 2d space to another through 3d.<br/><i>Navigation</i> is moving around a 3d space until arriving at a 2d space.<br/><i>Exploration</i> is moving around in 3d.<br/><i>Customization</i> is changing textures on 3d objects.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next for Papervision?</b></div><p>For the next version of papervision there are trying to include Full environments and skeletons. Full environments would include composition and camera work, compared to using the one-camera-centric stage that Flash begins with. With skeletons, they're looking at including Inverse Kinematics or Motion Capture for movement of human models. Also ASCOLLADA to import skeletons and animations from Maya and 3ds Max.</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>To conclude, he discussed where he gets his inspiration from. Games can inspire you into making a game, menu, or UI. Demos can inspire you into Special Effects. Motion Graphics can inspire composition and camera work. (and) Film and TV can inspire classic film making concepts. All these concepts are vital to creating 3d, so don't be adverse to sampling everything out there.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I thought this was a great presentation, but it really wasn't in my field of work. Papervision is a very powerful tool and hopefully more Flash developers will begin to adopt it so we can see more amazing things in the future ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day One" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one">Adobe Max Day One</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been to plenty of conventions before, but this would be my second work-related one.</p><p>This conference was huge.  Attended by 4300 people, across 60 or 70 sessions 4 or 5 times a day.  They packed so much information into this 3 day event, there's no way even a couple people could experience it all.  On the third my brain was so fired from constantly spinning and collecting information, I really needed a day to collect my thoughts and get everything down on 'paper'.</p><p>It was a fantastic time, though.  We stayed at the Chicago Hilton at night.  In the morning, they rented out big busses to shuttle people back and forth between their hotel and the convention center that held Max.</p><p>Breakfast was the first event of the day and was massively attended.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" /></p><p>One thing Adobe did expertly well was provide a very vegetarian based meal.

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Creativity Conducted, or Holographic Flash Projections with WiiMotes Deconstructed was lead by team BLITZ.  A company that is world-renowned for developing interactive advertising campaigns, rich internet applications and user interfaces.  So world-renowned, in fact, that they don't even have a wikipedia article....</p><p>This talk was lead by co-founders Ivan Todorov and Ken Martin as they discussed the trials and tribulations of developing the Creativity Conducted interactive WiiMote display at the Adobe Max party on Tuesday Night.</p><p>Going into this session, I really had no idea what they were going to talk about.  The title had the word WiiMote in it, so that shot my interest all the way up, but the description didn't say what they were using them for, or how they were using them, or what the hell was going on.  I thought that they may have been using these things with Flash or something..</p><p>What it was: BLITZ had built this massive 16 foot by 9 foot widescreen display that you can paint the timeline of Adobe onto using a WiiMote, and this session was discussing how they went about doing that.</p><div class='title'><b>Concept</b></div><p>Adobe approaches BLITZ and asks them to develop a big ass display for their Adobe Max Event.  The theme of the event is 3 decades of Adobe, so incorporate that in your product.</p><p>Ken Martin took the stage and discussed how they came up with the concept.  Adobe reaches out to everyone..  Nearly everyone on the planet has used an Adobe product in their life, and maybe not even realizing it..  I mean, if you've seen a YouTube video, you've used an Adobe product as YouTube videos use the Flash player.  Big to small, everyone has been touched by Adobe.</p><p>But how do you incorporate the creativity used with Adobe into a Chronology sequence.  Typically, the word Chronological implies "bored off your ass".  Time-lines are very static and full of information..  How can we make this fun?</p><p><em>Interaction</em><br/>Well, letting the User interact with the time-line is a good start.  Adding dynamic components to a very static concept is always a step in the right direction.</p><p><em>Paintbrushes</em><br/>Let the User paint their own time-line of events.  As the time-line becomes full of life, events in Adobe's lifetime will begin to tell their own story and begin to grow with the User's composition.</p><p><em>Save and Share</em><br/>Part of making a beautiful art piece is showing it off to the world.  Being able to save this image was a key feature to this project that needed to be included from the start.</p><div class='title'><b>Finding technology</b></div><p>So we want interaction..  Interaction how?  Everyone can use a mouse, but that's boring to do for a massive display.  Trackballs are great for a display as well, but how can someone paint with a track ball?  Being able to gesture the paint strokes would be great but we'd need a tool..</p><p>Why not the WiiMote?  With a swoosh of your hand, you'll be able to paint onto the screen, like you were conducting a symphony.  WiiMote are easy to find as well, we could add in a multiplayer component to this composition to make it very interactive and physical.</p><p>Now that we've got our input device, how are we going to make the thing?  Martin explained that they wanted to build this thing with 100% Adobe driven development.  The application will be made in Flash 9, using some open source Flash products.</p><p><a href="http://wiiflash.org/" title="http://wiiflash.org/" title="http://wiiflash.org/">Wii Flash</a>: To interpret the bluetooth signals from the WiiMote.<br/><a href="http://www.papervision3d.org/" title="http://www.papervision3d.org/" title="http://www.papervision3d.org/">Papervision 3D</a> For developing 3D graphics with flash.<br/><a href="http://bytearray.org/" title="http://bytearray.org/" title="http://bytearray.org/">Export to JPG</a>: To export the final composition to JPG.</p><p>Now:  How are we going to display this thing?  They wanted something big!  Something and in widescreen format.  Hell, why not 16 feet by 9 feet?  That's pretty easy to measure.  They ended up making the display with a DIY projector, a mesh fabric background, and a dimly lit room.</p><div class='title'><b>User Experience</b></div><p>This display is all about the User.  What are our goals when developing this User's experience and how do we want them to interact with the display?</p><p><em>Intuitive and Simple</em><br/>They want something very simple the User could pick up and play right away.  This meant simple instructions, and a very easy interact that didn't take much for the User to feel at home and ready to create.</p><p><em>Animated Brushes</em><br/>Let their design bloom.  When a User makes a stroke, the painting should bloom and come alive..  kind of like when you use very course paper, the strokes bleed into the page and it feels alive.</p><p><em>Illustrators</em><br/>To create these animated brushes, BLITZ hired 5 illustrators to design 5 different styles independently from each other from the 3 decades of adobe (the 80s, 90s, and 00s).</p><p>Since BLITZ would have 5 independent illustrations, they needed to design a plug-and-play importing system for their application to add and swap these brushes at will.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Flash for WiiMotes</b></div><p>With all the concepts covered for the project, Martin handed the mic over to Todorov to talk about Implementation.</p><p>The primary challenge with using the WiiMote is that the values it emits are mostly relative to it's position.  It knows the pitch, acceleration, and points relative to the IR sensor bar..  BUT the WiiMote does not know it's exact position on the screen.  Your application must interpret that data and figure out where's it's pointing.</p><p>Besides screen location, they also wanted to utilize distance to and from the screen to draw depth into the image.  On screen, that's where using Papervision was key.  Papervision is wonderful for 3D developers because their models can be directly imported from 3ds max or Maya.</p><p>Another challenge that cropped up with how to actually paint?  The WiiMote knew what buttons were being pressed, but how would they tell Flash about the depresses?  They used a Virtual Mouse program to reprogram their computer to use the WiiMote buttons as mouse clicks.</p><p><em>Pleasant Expectations</em><br/>Some things did go precisely as planned.  Adding a second WiiMote into the mix was dirt simple.  Using open source technologies through bytearray.org were great.  Papervision is fricken awesome.</p><p><em>Pleasant Surprises</em><br/>Throughout the course of development, they were surprised a few things.  Flash Player 9 is damn fast..  They were able to push and push the new flash player with very minimal lag.  Also, the WiiFlash community is very healthy.  Any problems that came up with WiiFlash were easily resolved with the help of the community.  And they even gave back by finding some bugs too.</p><p><em>Unpleasant Surprises</em><br/>With any project, you'll come across things that are a pain in the ass.  Limitations with the WiiMote were very annoying, as they can't interpret depth as well as they'd like.  You have a limited range you can use a WiiMote, and when you break that distance, it'll think you're pointing off screen.  Also, all their vector imagery had to be converted into rasterized images when outputting on screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Display</b></div><p>Once Todorov was done talking about Flash, Martin came back on stage to talk about creating the display they were going to use for this thing.  They needed a really fricken bright lens in their projector for a 16 foot by 9 foot display, so they went through several different bulbs before finding something bright enough.  The lens had 10,000 Lumens, for those that know whatever that means.</p><p>Google Sketch-up was incredibly helpful for placing everything into space.  It was good to see of sketch of how far the user will be from the screen relative to the size of the screen, and the placement of the IR sensor bar, and all that.</p><p>And he went through other boring construction type stuff that I didn't take notes on.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This session was pretty fun.  It was neat the see the creation of a very non-conventional piece of interactivity using state-of-the-art and very current technologies.  Always think outside the box ^_^.</p><p>Was it practical for me?  Not really.. I suck at flash.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day One - Effective Website Redesign" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-effective-website-redesign">Adobe Max Day One - Effective Website Redesign</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Neil Straghalis is one of the major players for the web team at Adobe.com. He has lead Seve website redesigns in the past years, and in this session he discusses what he has found to be the best techniques and design practices when redesigning a major website.</p><div class='title'><b>Strategy</b></div><p>He first asks.. Why? Why redesign your website? I mean, if something isn't broken, doen't fix it, right? Times change.. styles change, focus changes.. everything changes, and you must keep current. If you have a stale design, people will notice right away as being outdated, old.. You want to be on the cutting edge. Live in next year... not this year, and definitely not last year.</p><p>When you redesign your site, think about your goals. First off, have a goal in the first place.. You want to redesign your site because ______. Once you have your goal, make sure your entire team knows this goal. This is why we're redesigning the site, so keep this in mind with everything you do. Divide this goal into sub goals.. What are you business goals? What are your client's goals? What are your design goals?</p><p>Being goal oriented will make it easy to figure out where you are in the design process and if you correct in making your decisions. Basic software engineering stuff.. Have you list of requirements and adhere to it absolutely.</p><p>Another bit of strategy is Data or Content. Now that you have your goals, what content do you really need and what can you ditch. Do you really need a detailed account of Adobe's History on the front page of Adobe.com? Do you really need it on the site at all? If so, where should it go so it's not in the way of pushing your product line?</p><div class='title'><b>Redesign v. Reskin</b></div><p>When redesigning your site.. do you really need to completely overall the entire thing? Maybe a fresh coat of paint will accomplish your goals.</p><p>Skinning is an easy way to design what you already have in a different way. If the company changes focus from a family friendly environment to something with a more business oriented approach, switching out the graphics and redoing the CSS would probably be the best result, if they didn't want the content to change at all.</p><p>If skinning just won't do, then you should keep a few things in mind.. First off, What are you redesigning? What doesn't work with the site?.. What does work with the site? Also, define the scope of your redesign. Are you completely redoing all the pages of the entire site, or just the front couple of pages? Back to content and data.. what do you need? what don't you need?</p><p>Another thing you may not think about is Priority. What do you want the User to see on your site? What isn't so important on your site that you shouldn't spend too much time on?</p><p>Remember that the overall goal of a redesign is to make your site as good or better than the previous version, so if something simply isn't working, maybe you should rethink your decision and revisit your previous version.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Once you've developed your goals, and begun to form an idea of your redesign.. Design it! Start drawing mock-ups and coding prototypes. As you start building your website keep a few things in mind...</p><p><i>Build with a redesign in mind</i><br/>You're already begun to build your website, but experience tells us that everything can and will change. You will be redesigning what you're working on now, so build this new design with that in mind. Don't make things difficult for you in the future.</p><p><i>Generic Naming</i><br/>Part of that is naming things generic. You want to clearly label your CSS classes and ID tags so you have a general idea of what they do, and then reuse them all over your site. Don't be too specific or you'll get bogged down with thousands of IDs that you just cannot maintain.</p><p><i>Semantic Markup</i><br/>Speaking of CSS, Use it! Use it alot. This is rather obvious. CSS is there to make designing, skinning and the web experience as editable and customizable as possible. If you aren't using CSS, then you have fallen way behind of the times.</p><p><i>Separate Presentation from Content</i><br/>Build templates, and reuse CSS and JavaScript. Don't put too many details into each of your pages when you have an entire sites to build. Templates are a great way of reusing code throughout the site. When making a single change to your site, you don't want to make that change in a thousand places.</p><div class='title'><b>Design and Develop</b></div><p>Now we've gotten to the fun part ^_^. Bringing your design to life with all you have. Again.. be sure to use CSS, Templates, and Shared Assets. Shared Assets meaning.. use the same images, javascript files throughout the site rather than making them page specific. Reduce and Reuse!</p><p>Other methods of re-development can be Scripting, Find and Replace, Hand Coding, Application code updates, and XML... duh, right? The whole concept of a redesign is to generalize everything, but sometimes you do need a little bit of Hand Coding on a single page..</p><div class='title'><b>Adobe Developer Connection</b></div><p>At this point, Straghalis went through the steps his team took with Adobe.com and merging the Macromedia together. Currently his team is working on redesigning the current Adobe.com into something very customizable and personal to the User.</p><div class='title'><b>Summary</b></div><p>So.. to summarize, ask yourself Why redesign? When you know why you're redesigning, ask yourself What are you redesigning? When you know the scope, start doing something prototypes, and ALWAYS build with a redesign in mind.</p><p>Then once you're done, it's time for vacation!</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, I thought this was a great presentation full of rich practical information that really does work. Most of this stuff is rather obvious, but sometimes you just need to be reminded of it in a very organized way. ^_^ Great stuff.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day One - Online Ads that Attract" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-online-ads-that-attract">Adobe Max Day One - Online Ads that Attract</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Eric Natzke is an artist whose experience with Flash have been self-taught.  But throughout his career as a Flash developer and designer he continues to push the envelope of current trends and best practices when making his Flash movies.</p><p>Natzke's passion for art and animation and his goals have been facilitated by seeking out advertising jobs and taking each task as a completely new challenge.  "Ok, I've done ads for these guys before..  how can I do them better?" He would ask himself with each job that came his way.</p><p>This session was really self serving, so i didn't really get a whole lot out of it.  Especially since I suck at Flash.  I dunno, maybe it's easier these days, but the little I've played around with it and done tutorials simple result in ass, or work except for some bug I cannot solve.</p><p>Anywho, check out Natzke at <a href="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/" title="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/" title="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/">http://jot.eriknatzke.com/</a> and most of his work can be found at <a href="http://play.natzke.com/" title="http://play.natzke.com/" title="http://play.natzke.com/">http://play.natzke.com/</a>.
