I've been to plenty of conventions before, but this would be my second work-related one.</p><p>This conference was huge.  Attended by 4300 people, across 60 or 70 sessions 4 or 5 times a day.  They packed so much information into this 3 day event, there's no way even a couple people could experience it all.  On the third my brain was so fired from constantly spinning and collecting information, I really needed a day to collect my thoughts and get everything down on 'paper'.</p><p>It was a fantastic time, though.  We stayed at the Chicago Hilton at night.  In the morning, they rented out big busses to shuttle people back and forth between their hotel and the convention center that held Max.</p><p>Breakfast was the first event of the day and was massively attended.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" /></p><p>One thing Adobe did expertly well was provide a very vegetarian based meal.  It was great, nearly all their entrees and food was 100% vegetarian, so us non-meat eaters had plenty to eat.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0533.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0533.webp" /></p><p>After breakfast, was the first general session of the conference.

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Creativity Conducted, or Holographic Flash Projections with WiiMotes Deconstructed was lead by team BLITZ.  A company that is world-renowned for developing interactive advertising campaigns, rich internet applications and user interfaces.  So world-renowned, in fact, that they don't even have a wikipedia article....</p><p>This talk was lead by co-founders Ivan Todorov and Ken Martin as they discussed the trials and tribulations of developing the Creativity Conducted interactive WiiMote display at the Adobe Max party on Tuesday Night.</p><p>Going into this session, I really had no idea what they were going to talk about.  The title had the word WiiMote in it, so that shot my interest all the way up, but the description didn't say what they were using them for, or how they were using them, or what the hell was going on.  I thought that they may have been using these things with Flash or something..</p><p>What it was: BLITZ had built this massive 16 foot by 9 foot widescreen display that you can paint the timeline of Adobe onto using a WiiMote, and this session was discussing how they went about doing that.</p><div class='title'><b>Concept</b></div><p>Adobe approaches BLITZ and asks them to develop a big ass display for their Adobe Max Event.  The theme of the event is 3 decades of Adobe, so incorporate that in your product.</p><p>Ken Martin took the stage and discussed how they came up with the concept.  Adobe reaches out to everyone..  Nearly everyone on the planet has used an Adobe product in their life, and maybe not even realizing it..  I mean, if you've seen a YouTube video, you've used an Adobe product as YouTube videos use the Flash player.  Big to small, everyone has been touched by Adobe.</p><p>But how do you incorporate the creativity used with Adobe into a Chronology sequence.  Typically, the word Chronological implies "bored off your ass".  Time-lines are very static and full of information..  How can we make this fun?</p><p><em>Interaction</em><br/>Well, letting the User interact with the time-line is a good start.  Adding dynamic components to a very static concept is always a step in the right direction.</p><p><em>Paintbrushes</em><br/>Let the User paint their own time-line of events.  As the time-line becomes full of life, events in Adobe's lifetime will begin to tell their own story and begin to grow with the User's composition.</p><p><em>Save and Share</em><br/>Part of making a beautiful art piece is showing it off to the world.  Being able to save this image was a key feature to this project that needed to be included from the start.</p><div class='title'><b>Finding technology</b></div><p>So we want interaction..  Interaction how?  Everyone can use a mouse, but that's boring to do for a massive display.  Trackballs are great for a display as well, but how can someone paint with a track ball?  Being able to gesture the paint strokes would be great but we'd need a tool..</p><p>Why not the WiiMote?  With a swoosh of your hand, you'll be able to paint onto the screen, like you were conducting a symphony.  WiiMote are easy to find as well, we could add in a multiplayer component to this composition to make it very interactive and physical.</p><p>Now that we've got our input device, how are we going to make the thing?  Martin explained that they wanted to build this thing with 100% Adobe driven development.  The application will be made in Flash 9, using some open source Flash products.</p><p><a href="http://wiiflash.org/" title="http://wiiflash.org/">Wii Flash</a>: To interpret the bluetooth signals from the WiiMote.<br/><a href="http://www.papervision3d.org/" title="http://www.papervision3d.org/">Papervision 3D</a> For developing 3D graphics with flash.<br/><a href="http://bytearray.org/" title="http://bytearray.org/">Export to JPG</a>: To export the final composition to JPG.</p><p>Now:  How are we going to display this thing?  They wanted something big!  Something and in widescreen format.  Hell, why not 16 feet by 9 feet?  That's pretty easy to measure.  They ended up making the display with a DIY projector, a mesh fabric background, and a dimly lit room.</p><div class='title'><b>User Experience</b></div><p>This display is all about the User.  What are our goals when developing this User's experience and how do we want them to interact with the display?</p><p><em>Intuitive and Simple</em><br/>They want something very simple the User could pick up and play right away.  This meant simple instructions, and a very easy interact that didn't take much for the User to feel at home and ready to create.</p><p><em>Animated Brushes</em><br/>Let their design bloom.  When a User makes a stroke, the painting should bloom and come alive..  kind of like when you use very course paper, the strokes bleed into the page and it feels alive.</p><p><em>Illustrators</em><br/>To create these animated brushes, BLITZ hired 5 illustrators to design 5 different styles independently from each other from the 3 decades of adobe (the 80s, 90s, and 00s).</p><p>Since BLITZ would have 5 independent illustrations, they needed to design a plug-and-play importing system for their application to add and swap these brushes at will.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Flash for WiiMotes</b></div><p>With all the concepts covered for the project, Martin handed the mic over to Todorov to talk about Implementation.</p><p>The primary challenge with using the WiiMote is that the values it emits are mostly relative to it's position.  It knows the pitch, acceleration, and points relative to the IR sensor bar..  BUT the WiiMote does not know it's exact position on the screen.  Your application must interpret that data and figure out where's it's pointing.</p><p>Besides screen location, they also wanted to utilize distance to and from the screen to draw depth into the image.  On screen, that's where using Papervision was key.  Papervision is wonderful for 3D developers because their models can be directly imported from 3ds max or Maya.</p><p>Another challenge that cropped up with how to actually paint?  The WiiMote knew what buttons were being pressed, but how would they tell Flash about the depresses?  They used a Virtual Mouse program to reprogram their computer to use the WiiMote buttons as mouse clicks.</p><p><em>Pleasant Expectations</em><br/>Some things did go precisely as planned.  Adding a second WiiMote into the mix was dirt simple.  Using open source technologies through bytearray.org were great.  Papervision is fricken awesome.</p><p><em>Pleasant Surprises</em><br/>Throughout the course of development, they were surprised a few things.  Flash Player 9 is damn fast..  They were able to push and push the new flash player with very minimal lag.  Also, the WiiFlash community is very healthy.  Any problems that came up with WiiFlash were easily resolved with the help of the community.  And they even gave back by finding some bugs too.</p><p><em>Unpleasant Surprises</em><br/>With any project, you'll come across things that are a pain in the ass.  Limitations with the WiiMote were very annoying, as they can't interpret depth as well as they'd like.  You have a limited range you can use a WiiMote, and when you break that distance, it'll think you're pointing off screen.  Also, all their vector imagery had to be converted into rasterized images when outputting on screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Display</b></div><p>Once Todorov was done talking about Flash, Martin came back on stage to talk about creating the display they were going to use for this thing.  They needed a really fricken bright lens in their projector for a 16 foot by 9 foot display, so they went through several different bulbs before finding something bright enough.  The lens had 10,000 Lumens, for those that know whatever that means.</p><p>Google Sketch-up was incredibly helpful for placing everything into space.  It was good to see of sketch of how far the user will be from the screen relative to the size of the screen, and the placement of the IR sensor bar, and all that.</p><p>And he went through other boring construction type stuff that I didn't take notes on.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This session was pretty fun.  It was neat the see the creation of a very non-conventional piece of interactivity using state-of-the-art and very current technologies.  Always think outside the box ^_^.</p><p>Was it practical for me?  Not really.. I suck at flash.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Effective Website Redesign" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-effective-website-redesign">Adobe Max - Effective Website Redesign</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 5, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Neil Straghalis is one of the major players for the web team at Adobe.com. He has lead Seve website redesigns in the past years, and in this session he discusses what he has found to be the best techniques and design practices when redesigning a major website.</p><div class='title'><b>Strategy</b></div><p>He first asks.. Why? Why redesign your website? I mean, if something isn't broken, doen't fix it, right? Times change.. styles change, focus changes.. everything changes, and you must keep current. If you have a stale design, people will notice right away as being outdated, old.. You want to be on the cutting edge. Live in next year... not this year, and definitely not last year.</p><p>When you redesign your site, think about your goals. First off, have a goal in the first place.. You want to redesign your site because ______. Once you have your goal, make sure your entire team knows this goal. This is why we're redesigning the site, so keep this in mind with everything you do. Divide this goal into sub goals.. What are you business goals? What are your client's goals? What are your design goals?</p><p>Being goal oriented will make it easy to figure out where you are in the design process and if you correct in making your decisions. Basic software engineering stuff.. Have you list of requirements and adhere to it absolutely.</p><p>Another bit of strategy is Data or Content. Now that you have your goals, what content do you really need and what can you ditch. Do you really need a detailed account of Adobe's History on the front page of Adobe.com? Do you really need it on the site at all? If so, where should it go so it's not in the way of pushing your product line?</p><div class='title'><b>Redesign v. Reskin</b></div><p>When redesigning your site.. do you really need to completely overall the entire thing? Maybe a fresh coat of paint will accomplish your goals.</p><p>Skinning is an easy way to design what you already have in a different way. If the company changes focus from a family friendly environment to something with a more business oriented approach, switching out the graphics and redoing the CSS would probably be the best result, if they didn't want the content to change at all.</p><p>If skinning just won't do, then you should keep a few things in mind.. First off, What are you redesigning? What doesn't work with the site?.. What does work with the site? Also, define the scope of your redesign. Are you completely redoing all the pages of the entire site, or just the front couple of pages? Back to content and data.. what do you need? what don't you need?</p><p>Another thing you may not think about is Priority. What do you want the User to see on your site? What isn't so important on your site that you shouldn't spend too much time on?</p><p>Remember that the overall goal of a redesign is to make your site as good or better than the previous version, so if something simply isn't working, maybe you should rethink your decision and revisit your previous version.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Once you've developed your goals, and begun to form an idea of your redesign.. Design it! Start drawing mock-ups and coding prototypes. As you start building your website keep a few things in mind...</p><p><i>Build with a redesign in mind</i><br/>You're already begun to build your website, but experience tells us that everything can and will change. You will be redesigning what you're working on now, so build this new design with that in mind. Don't make things difficult for you in the future.</p><p><i>Generic Naming</i><br/>Part of that is naming things generic. You want to clearly label your CSS classes and ID tags so you have a general idea of what they do, and then reuse them all over your site. Don't be too specific or you'll get bogged down with thousands of IDs that you just cannot maintain.</p><p><i>Semantic Markup</i><br/>Speaking of CSS, Use it! Use it alot. This is rather obvious. CSS is there to make designing, skinning and the web experience as editable and customizable as possible. If you aren't using CSS, then you have fallen way behind of the times.</p><p><i>Separate Presentation from Content</i><br/>Build templates, and reuse CSS and JavaScript. Don't put too many details into each of your pages when you have an entire sites to build. Templates are a great way of reusing code throughout the site. When making a single change to your site, you don't want to make that change in a thousand places.</p><div class='title'><b>Design and Develop</b></div><p>Now we've gotten to the fun part ^_^. Bringing your design to life with all you have. Again.. be sure to use CSS, Templates, and Shared Assets. Shared Assets meaning.. use the same images, javascript files throughout the site rather than making them page specific. Reduce and Reuse!</p><p>Other methods of re-development can be Scripting, Find and Replace, Hand Coding, Application code updates, and XML... duh, right? The whole concept of a redesign is to generalize everything, but sometimes you do need a little bit of Hand Coding on a single page..</p><div class='title'><b>Adobe Developer Connection</b></div><p>At this point, Straghalis went through the steps his team took with Adobe.com and merging the Macromedia together. Currently his team is working on redesigning the current Adobe.com into something very customizable and personal to the User.</p><div class='title'><b>Summary</b></div><p>So.. to summarize, ask yourself Why redesign? When you know why you're redesigning, ask yourself What are you redesigning? When you know the scope, start doing something prototypes, and ALWAYS build with a redesign in mind.</p><p>Then once you're done, it's time for vacation!</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, I thought this was a great presentation full of rich practical information that really does work. Most of this stuff is rather obvious, but sometimes you just need to be reminded of it in a very organized way. ^_^ Great stuff.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max - Online Ads that Attract" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-online-ads-that-attract">Adobe Max - Online Ads that Attract</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Eric Natzke is an artist whose experience with Flash have been self-taught.  But throughout his career as a Flash developer and designer he continues to push the envelope of current trends and best practices when making his Flash movies.</p><p>Natzke's passion for art and animation and his goals have been facilitated by seeking out advertising jobs and taking each task as a completely new challenge.  "Ok, I've done ads for these guys before..  how can I do them better?" He would ask himself with each job that came his way.</p><p>This session was really self serving, so i didn't really get a whole lot out of it.  Especially since I suck at Flash.  I dunno, maybe it's easier these days, but the little I've played around with it and done tutorials simple result in ass, or work except for some bug I cannot solve.</p><p>Anywho, check out Natzke at <a href="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/" title="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/">http://jot.eriknatzke.com/</a> and most of his work can be found at <a href="http://play.natzke.com/" title="http://play.natzke.com/">http://play.natzke.com/</a>.

The session was all about getting started using AIR and writing an AIR application using simple HTML and JavaScript.</p><p>This session was lead by Jeff Tapper, a web consultant with clients including Harley Davidson, Toys R Us, IBM, Dow Jones, American Express, and so forth.  He is an Adobe certified instructor teaching about Flex, ColdFusion, and Flash.  He's also written and edited a few books too, including <em>Flex 2: Training from the Source</em> and <em>OO Programming with ActionScript 2.0</em>.  This guy has quite a bit of credentials, but he apologized that this session really didn't do anything with Flex.</p><p>Since this was a Hands On session, the room was full of PCs ready for messin' with.  Tapper lead us through 5 examples he had setup and ready to go.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" /></p><p>Even though this was the first session I had attended at MAX, the focus of this whole conference was very clear: AIR.  AIR is an acronym for Adobe's Integrated Runtime environment.  It's their desktop VM you can run Adobe's web based programming languages against.  It's rather revolutionary really.. being able to develop and deploy desktop applications with your knowledge of web development is quite an idea.</p><p>I was quite excited to dive into this stuff since it had been crammed down my throat all morning.  I mean, how do you do this stuff?</p><p>All the computers were setup with <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a>, an Eclipse based IDE specifically developed for AIR development, which is free for download on <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana's Website</a>.  You just create a new project, type out some HTML and some Javascript and BAM.. you've got an AIR app.</p><p>The five examples he brought us through were <b>Copy and Paste</b>, <b>Drag and Drop</b>, <b>Network Connectability</b>, and two others I don't really remember.  This was all done in JavaScript calling methods from the AIR API.  Pretty slick stuff.</p><p>Again, check out <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a> and play around with it for yourself. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adobe Max Day 1 Keynote by Kevin Lynch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adobe-max-day-one-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch">Adobe Max Day 1 Keynote by Kevin Lynch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In fact, it really wasn't a keynote at all..  It was an hour and a half long commercial about Adobe, about MAX, and about what you can do with Adobe.  Kevin Lynch traded off with several other developers and designers who would give a run down of what was new with their product or how Adobe was the perfect solution for them.</p><p>There was one piece of technology that was very exciting out of all this.  That was that flash now supports the H.264 HD video format.  So, now you can publish video in flash up to 1080p and it will work seemlessly across multiple platforms that support the H.264 format, like Flash Player 9 on the web, mobile phones, TVs, and the Playstation 3.</p><p>One of the presenters Lynch brought up on a stage did have some useful information we all could use.  He discussed 5 ways to give you User a great experience with your product.</p><div class='title'><b>Content is King</b></div><p>Websites should not prevent the User from getting at what they want.  They are at the website to view content..  Your design must be subtle and helpful for the User to achieve their goals as effortlessly as possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Make it Personal</b></div><p>Adding that personal touch for the User will make them feel more at home and provide an atmosphere that is efficient for them.  This involves skinning and customability of design and workflow for your website.</p><div class='title'><b>Less is (still) more</b></div><p>This goes back to the idea of being subtle.  Your design should not get in the way of the User and should accent the User's experience, not inhibit.</p><div class='title'><b>Movement has meaning</b></div><p>Add movement and animation to transitions between navigation.  What the User feel like they are actually moving through the UI rather than just one page to the next.  This gives a sense of depth into the content and provides the User with information of what they've done to reach their current destination.</p><div class='title'><b>Create an Experience, not a UI.</b></div><p>Pulling all these concepts together will give the User a unique experience that will stay with them and will keep them coming back and bringing other Users to your site.  The Internet is the most interactive medium the average person has at their finger tips, so WOW them.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-3">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><b>Java 6 Features</b> w/ Venkat Subranium</p><p>On this third day of christmas I started of in Venkat's Java 6 features talk, which was rather enlightening.  He talked about how Java 6 has integrated the use of scripting languages into the java language and how scripting languages can use the java libraries on their own.  You can also pull in script files into your java code, run them, and play around with the results of the run code.</p><p>Something that peeked my curiosity a little more was the next feature he talked about: instantiated an instance of the compiler and being able to compile and run new code at runtime.  That's freakin' awesome.  You could do some pretty fun AI functionality by setting up some program that would write, compile and run code all on its own.  I think about having just a simple Body class sitting on a server somewhere.  It doesn't have much... just one method that takes in a filepath.  I'll send that sucker an Arm class..  The body reads and runs that Arm class and instantly makes it its own.  Pretty handy.</p><p>Eventually if you quite giving more intelligent body parts it might be able to start writing up code for making its own limbs and the code monster keeps growing...  Then the terminator would come back through time to kill me.</p><p><b>Advanced Selenium</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>Anywho...  the next panel I went to was Selenium which was also pretty slick.  Even though we use Selenium at work, i never really knew what it was about.  I thought it was just some JavaScript testing tool...  but i guess i got that backwards.  Selenium is a testing tool written in JavaScript.  You can, or write Java code to, fill out table information representing actions taken to traverse your website.  Stuff like..  fill in User text field with 'NameString', click on login, click on this and that, buy this, logout, all the while sticking in several asserts to make sure your system is doing what you want.</p><p>This is a fantastic way to test your webframe work.  Just input all your Use cases into Selenium, hit play, and it'll return all the infractions of your Use cases for you.  Huzzah..  No need to run through everything on your own.</p><p>You could also setup Selenium to run a bunch of macros that will get your within your system quicker..</p><p><b>Expert Panel</b> @ Lunch</p><p>After lunch was the expert panel discussion, which had 8 or 9 speakers take questions from the crowd.  The question of 'how should students be taught programming basics and lore when there are so many modern day languages and tools that remove the need to explicitly know about them?' was posed.  Problems are posed when teaching students only Java as language, because then they know nothing of garbage collection and memory leaks.  Problems are posed when teaching students a loosely typed language, because then type know nothing of type casting and such.  Where do teachers begin the learning process, yet still get them up to speed with the technologies of today.</p><p>Everyone on the panel said their peace about their thoughts..  Certainly, the consensus was don't tie them down to one language and CERTAINLY don't tie them down to one platform.  No one language is infinite.  One quote from the weekend was, "Don't think of software as gold bars sitting in a vault..  Software is more like lettuce.  If you let it sit, it will degrade and rot away.. "  This is true with all technologies in this field.  You have to keep current to be a valued member of this industry or else you'll be structurally unemployed sooner than you think.</p><p>This really extends further to almost all industries..  All industries evolve..</p><p>As an addendum, they added, that that's not to say forget about the past..  You don't need to know how to write code at the byte code level, but you should definitely know how that byte level code is used.  You should know the inner workings of the constructs you are building on.  Computers aren't MAGIC..  they are technological devices built on technologies built on technologies..  If you don't know how the technologies you are using as a foundation, then you have no business building on them.</p><p>Another topic brought up during this time was open source technologies with the slogan, "get your ass out there and help out"  Open source communities are the main driver's for developing these technologies, not just creators of the technologies..  The communities are the ones that pick up the left over parts, fix bugs and clean up the code which shapes and completes the projects..  Even if you needed a selfish reason to work on something, think of the scenario of coming into a job interview and being able to say that you worked on that open source technology that that company is currently using.  Dump that on your resume.</p><p><b>Reflection</b> w/ Ted</p><p>After such stirring lunch conversation, the sessions started up again.  I attended Ted ___'s guide to reflection.  Reflection is basically making an object that is the representation of a class.  This object has all the methods and fields, but this is not an instantiation of the class itself.  With reflection you can actual get to private data and methods..  Which is handy in some instances..</p><p>This is also how annotations are utilized.  When you grab the class, you can get the annotations from that class and process that information.  huzzah.  This was a repeat of Venkat's annotation talk the previous morning.</p><p><b>10 Ways to Improve your code</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>stuff to come...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-2">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 2, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, i'm at the No Fluff Just Stuff conference in beautiful 'Millwaukee'.  This whole conference seems to be very Jave development oriented and  showcases several brilliant developers of Java and Java-like technologies.  There is also a huge focus on thw web services side of Java development,  which makes this conference right up my own alley, as well as, Widen's alley.</p><p>It's pretty much like any convention except the people speaking are actual experts rather than amatuer fans of the product.  Case in point, the three speakers I attended today were actually developers of the framework they showcased.  David Gaery showcased JSF, Venkat Subramaniam showcased Grails, and Scott Davis showcased Atom, though Davis isn't really responsible for Atom.  It is really amazing to listen to these heavyweights of the Java community talk about their passion.</p><p>Atom certainly caught my eye today, but what i'm really shopping around for is a web framework I can use and implement for theschlock.com.</p><p>JSF was kinda fun, but it felt rather heavy duty for what I wish to accomplish.  Grails is simply amazing, but it seemed difficult to customize.</p><p>What I want to do with theschlock.com is quite simply.  I want to make it a navigatable portfolio of all my old art and other random crations i've had over the years.  An end all resource of all the crap I've done.</p><p>I want to use one of these crazy new technologies because it'll give me the experience of playing around with something new and cool, as well as demonstrate my proficency of applying said technology.</p><p>After thinking about a few things though: what I want to do is quite simply.  A ton of entries sorted by date and possibly by category.  This is easily accomplished using technologies i've been using for the past couple of years.  Hell, just build a javascript 'database' type file and have page javascript load and render all those elements and huzzah..  i've got my website.  :shrugs: I guess I could do it that way.  why make things more complicated then they have to be.</p><p>Maybe i'll just search for a technology to develop a beautiful photo navigator for all the 15,000 pictures i've taken over these last four years.</p><p>Anyways, Grails is pretty amazing.  I wouldn't mind playing around with that.  Much like its' initial model: rails, it utilizes Convention over Configuration, which means you do everything a specific way rather than write up a bunch of config files to tell he framework what the hell you are doing.  This type of framework lends itself extremely well to Agile development, since you can write code fast, rather than spending time configuring everything.</p><p>The highlight of the evening was Scott Davis' keynote speach, which confronted the question of choice...  basically.</p><p>ugh...  I'm typing this up on my phone and getting rather bored.  i'll finish this up later.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/conferences">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
