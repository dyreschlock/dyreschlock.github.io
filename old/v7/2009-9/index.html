| September 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>5 years ago (yesterday), Namco released Katamari Damacy on PlayStation 2 at a mere $20.  They weren't sure how well it would sell in the states, so they gave it a reduced "budget" price, and let the market take its course.  Sales were slow, but word of mouth spread quickly, and fastly became a cult classic.  In fact, the Katamari Damacy franchise is one of my favorite video games to date.</p><p>I don't think there's any game released in the last 5 years that's as upbeat and quirky as Katamari.  A smile comes across my face every time I start a game.  It's a very zen-like experience to roll around the world and pick up whatever you can.</p><p>There has seen been 4 sequels to Katamari Damacy.  We Love Katamari is the PlayStation 2 follow-up released 1 year later, which polished gameplay and graphics, added variety, and has become the definite Katamari title.  After We Love Katamari, creator <b>Keita Takahashi</b> said he was done with the franchise and started working on new stuff.  That didn't stop Namco, which released a PSP game and then an Xbox 360 game.  Both of which were rather lack luster.</p><p>Yesterday, on the 5th anniversary of Katamari in the US, Katamari finally returns home to the PlayStation console in Katamari Forever on PlayStation 3.  Katamari Forever is part compliation, part remix, and upscale of all the previous releases.  I think they said it was 10% or 20% new material, but it's all these levels in one disc!  Plus, all the levels run in 1080p.  Also, you can change the graphical representation of the levels with separate skins and models.</p><p>I'm a huge fan of Katamari, so it's already purchased and in the mail.  To commemorate the new release, here's my favorite pieces of Katamari fanart I've collected over the past 5 years.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Damashy</b></div><p>by Oekaki Pocket</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp"  /></p><p>After the release of Katamari Damacy in 2004, I came across this picture on the internet.  Katamari's graphics are rather abstract, so it was interesting seeing a realistic approach to what a Katamari ball might actually look like.  When I was doing the Katamari Tshirt design for <a href="http://spamm.org" title="http://spamm.org">SPAMM</a>, I modeled some of my object after this picture.</p><p>I found the Oekaki Pocket website, but I was unable to find a larger version of the picture.  He just has a bunch of loli drawings and sketches on his site now.  Here's the link: <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oekaki/pocket/opo/pocket.html" title="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oekaki/pocket/opo/pocket.html">Oekaki Pocket: Scribble Works Gallery</a></p><div class='title'><b>Papercraft Prince</b></div><p>by Yuuku</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp"  /></p><p>Papercraft was becoming rather popular with nerdy folks on the Internet around 2004 and 2005, so a papercraft version of The Prince became widely linked picture very quickly.  In Fall 2005, when carving a Katamari pumpkin, I finally printed, cut out, and glued together a papercraft Prince of my own, which has migrated from several computer monitors since.</p><p>Here's the original site for the papercraft Prince: <a href="http://fccafe.fc2web.com/ptamacy.html" title="http://fccafe.fc2web.com/ptamacy.html">å¡?é­?ï¼?ç??å­ï¼?ã®ã??ã?¼ã??ã?¼ã?¯ã?©ã??ã??</a> (Katamari Damacy Prince Papercraft)</p><div class='title'><b>"Auto Wash"</b></div><p>by Mac Hall</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp"  /></p><p>Many webcomics latched onto Katamari Damacy, the same way fan artists did.  I like the Mac Hall entry the best mainly for the art.  Mac Hall is a pretty damn good artist, and his comic doesn't overly shove the comedy of the game in your face that way almost every other comic did.  It's subtle and clean.</p><p>Here's the link to the original: <a href="http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2005-02-21" title="http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2005-02-21">MacHall - Feb 21st, 2005</a></p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Otaku Planet</b></div><p>by Sudori</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp"  /></p><p>Otaku Planet is a much better rendition of the "roll of anime shit" idea that I used for the SPAMM shirt.  The fun thing about Katamari fanart is the amount of detail and references put into the stuff already rolled up into the ball.  You can stare at the thing for a while and continue to pick out new stuff.  Otaku Planet is just that.  Pikachu, Sailor Moon, Rurouni Kenshin, Naruto, Bleach, Domo-kun, Full Metal Alchemist, Card Captor Sakura, Totoro, CLAMP, Final Fantasy, so on and so on...</p><p>Here's the link to Sudori's DeviantArt page: <a href="http://sudoru.deviantart.com/art/katamari-otaku-planet-35539619" title="http://sudoru.deviantart.com/art/katamari-otaku-planet-35539619">DeviantArt - Sudori</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Colossal Katamari</b></div><p>by Snake</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp"  /></p><p>Shadow of the Colossus is another cult classic Playstation 2 game that was released within the same month as the second Katamari game, We Love Katamari.  Artist Snake marries the two games together with the Prince rolling up the first two Colossi.</p><p>Here's the link to the original on Pixel Joint: <a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com/pixelart/17123.htm#" title="http://www.pixeljoint.com/pixelart/17123.htm#">Pixel Joint</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>That's how I Roll</b></div><p>by ???</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariTshirt.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariTshirt.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariTshirt.webp"  /></p><p>I love the clean, stenciled look of this design.  Unfortunately, I really don't know much about who actually made it.  Links point <a href="http://tcritic.com/archives/this-is-how-i-roll-katamari-damacy-t-shirt/" title="http://tcritic.com/archives/this-is-how-i-roll-katamari-damacy-t-shirt/">here</a> and there, but I came across this design way before I was ever able to find a Tshirt with the pattern.  And now you can't find this Tshirt at all.  Nor the original high quality picture of the artwork.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4">Dexter Season 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Like Seasons 2 and 3, the first episode of the new Season of Dexter was leaked to the Internet just a few weeks before its premiere.  It's almost like it's intentional.  It definitely seemed intentional with Seasons 2 and 3.  The quality of the DivX file was superb.  The file I have of Season 4 episode 1 is pretty crappy, so I don't think it was intentional this time.  But who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Where we've been</b></div><p>Dexter is a pretty great show.  Season 1 was an amazing introduction to Dexter.  It displayed Dexter's thoughts and reasoning.  The emergence of a rival serial killer offered mystery, and eventually unraveled into a mirror of himself, his past, and his future.</p><p>Season 2 lost the mystery, but masked it with constant suspense.  Season 2 builds on all the character development from the previous season and demonstrates how well rounded the characters and cast are.  Unfortunately, it is a shallow experience compared to the first Season.</p><p>The typecast, thin representation of the Dexter cast really shows its colors in Season 3.  Season 3 settles down the suspense and mystery and adds character plot after character plot.  Dexter starts to lose spotlight, and Debra, Angel, and Laguerta become essential characters.  I think the writers and producers have become to comfortable with their jobs after Dexter was renewed up through Season 5 given the success of Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>The acting and writing has become very much like a sitcom.  Each actor has their character and always operates in these roles.  The only person that brings any personality to their character is Michael C. Hall with Dexter, which is ironic as he plays an emotionally distanced character.  It's gotten so transparent that it's difficult to watch.</p><p>I'd stop watching the show if I wasn't so invested in these characters.  Plus, I hold hope that Dexter will eventually recapture what made Season 1 so fantastic.  But I think they've completely run Dexter's character dry for story.  Maybe that's why the other characters have become so prevalent.</p><p>Season 3 is a stain in this series and takes it further away from what made it great.  Though, after watching the first episode of Season 4 that gleaming shimmer of hope flickers in my eye.</p><div class='title'><b>New Beginnings</b></div><p>Once the news broke that <b>John Lithgow</b> was the villian in Season 4, I was immediately excited.  Finally, a REAL actor in this dying show.  Michael C. Hall is a pretty good actor, but his range is not nearly as vast as Lithgow.  I was excited to see what they had in store.  Plus, there hasn't been a serial killer villain worth his weight since Season 1.</p><p>Rudy (or whomever) was the perfect villain for Season 1.  But Season 2 and 3?  Technically both seasons had its share of minor villains that Dexter had to vex in order to come out on top.  The story was spread and became weak as a result.  Aside from John Lithgow, Season 4's focus of a single villain should make the story much tighter.</p><div class='title'><b>Or is it..?</b></div><p>Unfortunately, with all these characters and stories of their own, I feel that the serial killing aspect of the show will become less and less important.  The writers seem to care more about the supporting cast and Dexter's home life than what the show was about to begin with.</p><p>Dexter always killed people as an outward expression of dealing with his problems.  It helped him work shit out.  But now, it just seems like he would be better off if he didn't.  His problems are the result of his serial killing.  So give it up!  Dexter already proved that this is not an addiction, so why is he still killing if it's screwing things up?</p><div class='title'><b>Ramble Ramble</b></div><p>Even though I'm pretty negative about the show, I'm still optimistic that Season 4 will turn out alright.  I don't see how it could be worse than Season 3, but the writers have a knack for throwing ridiculous plot points into the mix (SPOILER: such as the end of this first episode), so who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Dexter Season 4 begins this weekend on Showtime!</b></div><p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Motivation to Run" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/motivation-to-run">Motivation to Run</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning I ran my 3rd Half Marathon.  I finished around the same time as previously, but just a little bit quicker.  In the Madison Half Marathon, I finished at 2 hours 50 minutes, but it was probably closer to <b>2 hours 48 minutes</b>, as it took 2 minutes to cross the starting line.  I finished the Madison Mini Marathon is <b>2 hours 45 minutes</b>.  And today, I finished the Fox Cities Marathon is <b>2 hours 43 minutes</b>.</p><p>After finishing my first Half Marathon, I wrote about why I <a href="/old/v7/run-run-run" title="/run-run-run">decided to Run</a>. Spoiler! I saw the movie, Run Fatboy Run, and thought it looked pretty easy.  And it wasn't too difficult.  That first half marathon beat the shit out of me, but it gave me perspective and motivation for fitness.</p><div class='title'><b>Motivation</b></div><p>Motivation is the reason I signed up for another 2 Half Marathon right after finishing the first.  Motivation to continue running on my own and exercise regularly.  Overall, I run to lose weight and keep fit.  I like to be light on my feet.  But running builds Motivation of its own.  The energy spent and built while running keeps the body in motion throughout the day.  It eases my lazy tendencies and lightens my mood.  The cycle of exercise and motivation to exercise is just as powerful as the cycle to sit there and not exercise.</p><p>During a marathon, that motivation is far greater because you're surrounded by thousands of other people that have the motivation to get out of bed on very early weekend morning and run for a few hours as the sunrises.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_0181.webp" /></p><p>Everyone is there for different reasons, but those reasons give them the same motivation that guides their feat across the pavement and eventually across the finish line.  And at the finish line you're given a medal for you hard work.  There are few exercises that will award with a medal on top of the health, fitness and perpetual motivation.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090920_marathon/IMG_4950.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>The daylight continues to escape the skies, the leaves have started to wither and rot, and the temperature is declining.  Fall is here and my weekends are rather busy, so I don't have the time to take in any more half marathons this year.  Though, I will probably do Gilda's Run on October 24th in Middleton, which is 5 miles.</p><p>I've been looking at Half Marathon dates next year and have a couple that look like fun.</p><p>Feb 28th // Gasparilla Half Marathon in Tampa, Florida<br/>May 1st // Door County Half Marathon in Pennisula Park, Wisconsin<br/>May 1st // Wisconsin Half Marathon is Kenosha, Wisconsin (one or the other, not both)<br/>May 30th // Madison Half Marathon in Madison, Wisconsin<br/>Jun 6th // Minneapolis Half Marathon in Minneapolis, Minnesota</p><p>Hopefully, that Florida Half Marathon will keep me running over the next 5 months.  I started "training" back in March this year, so the cold shouldn't keep me away.  Though, huge gaping breaths in cold tempatures could probably screw up my throat.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: SWAG and Purchases" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-swag-and-purchases">PAX 09: SWAG and Purchases</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Since the announcement of Star Wars The Old Republic and their lofty plans for a story-driven nature in an MMO, I was definitely intrigued and ready to purchase to see just how they planned on accomplishing that.  Though, Star Wars fan were more excited about the idea of a new Star Wars MMORPG that would probably not suck.</p><p>Star Trek fans had the same excitement early last year when Cryptic Studios announced <b>Star Trek Online</b>.  Cryptic Studios have been responsible for City of Heroes/Villains, a super hero oriented MMORPG that they sold to NCSoft after acquiring the Marvel MMO rights.  Unfortunately Marvel fell through, and they changed the game to Champions Online to directly compete with their previous MMO.</p><p>Cryptic had many demo stations of the recently released Champions Online, but reserved a couple units for Star Trek Online which Five gave a try.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Star Trek Canon</b></div><p>Between Star Wars and Star Trek, I'm totally a fan of Star Trek.  I watched Star Trek The Next Generation every night before going to bed in High School.  I've seen all the movies, watched almost all of Deep Space Nine and Voyager.  So, while Five tried to figure out the annoying controls, I talked with a demonstrator about the canon of Star Trek in Star Trek Online.</p><p><b>Me</b>: What time period does Star Trek Online cover?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Star Trek Online takes place 30 years after the destruction of Romulus.  If you've seen the most recent Star Trek film, the Murauder and future Spock had journeyed back in time because of those events.  So, Star Trek Online takes place further in time than any Star Trek series or movie.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Can you play as any Star Trek race?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, you can play as any race that has ever appeared in any Star Trek series or movie.  In fact, you can make up your own race if you'd like.</p><p><b>Me</b>: That's weird...</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Weird?!  We at Cryptic think it's pretty cool.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Are there different factions or something?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, in Star Trek Online, you can choose between the Federation and Klingon.  In the Star Trek timeline, the destruction of Romulus cast doubt in the Klingon high council that the Federation had any idea of what they were doing.  Harsh words were spoken, and the Klingon broke off from the Federation.  Many of the events in Star Trek Online focus on that conflict and you can choose your sides.</p><p><b>Me</b>: So, if you're Federation, you just fight Klingons?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Absolutely not, Star Trek Online goes into all the conflicts with a wide range of Alien races throughout the Star Trek Universe.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Okey Dokey, sounds like fun ^_^</p><p><b>Me thinking</b>: eh, not really.</p><div class='title'><b>Combat</b></div><p>The demo focused completely on Combat.  That's all you really do in an MMO anyways.  Five commanded an Away on a planet's surface and started fighting some Klingons.  The Klingons were pretty weak though :/  This was pretty boring, so he beamed back to the ship and warped to another planet.</p><p>While orbiting another planet, Klingons appeared!  What strife!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp"  /></p><p>Space combat is pretty interesting and much more involved than clicking on dudes and beating them down with swords or phasers.  Those circular bars around your ship indicate the strength of your shields in those areas.  Depending on where you're taking fire, only those shields will be affected.  So, if you start taking a lot of damage in the rear, you should turn around and take damage from the side or front to even it out.</p><p>Much like every combat in a recent Star Trek, you can totally change the amount of energy put into the shields, or life support, or weapons on the fly!  "Full power to forward weapons!"  That's another thing, depending on the direction you're facing you can only fire aft torpedoes or forward phasers.  It's pretty damn sweet how they integrated very fundamental concepts from Space Battles in the movies or series into the game.</p><p>That being said, it's incredibly annoying to keep everything straight.  At least, it was in the first 5 minutes of the fight.  The races you choose also have an effect on evasive maneuvers and other things.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This game is pretty stupid.  I don't really see any point to it at all unless you're an absolute fan of Star Trek.  Creating your own race would be fun to fill in the gaps that Cryptic missed, but overall it's just a level grind.  The story sounds boring as crap with scrolling text relaying anything important.  I'm not going to pay attention to that.</p><p>The Space Combat was kinda neat though, but that's the only positive I got from the demo and it's really only a novelty to recreate battles from episode of Next Generation.</p><p>Star Trek Online releases for the PC sometime next year, if not 2011.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Split Second Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-split-second-hands-on">PAX 09: Split Second Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While in Seattle, I stayed with some of my college friends, Ace and Jess.  Returning home on Saturday, Ace asked a pretty important question regarding the nature of PAX.  <b>Were there any games you saw or played that you had no intention of buying until after you saw or played them?</b> Every company exhibiting games at PAX was there for the sole purpose of selling their game.  They weren't there for fun.</p><p>This has happened a couple times in the past.  In 2007, after seeing Mass Effect in action, I was sold.  Last year, Castle Crashers completely changed my mind and I bought it on the spot.</p><p>This year, that game would have to be Split Second.  Though, I wouldn't say it put me in a buying mood.  It definitely caught my eye and I totally want to play more of it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Racing!</b></div><p><b>Split Second</b> is a racing game, but has some elements that reminds me of the Burnout series.  In your effort to finish first, you can knock out your opponents by causing explosions and considerably changing the environment of the racetrack.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp"  /></p><p>Throughout the race you build up that blue/red meter underneath your car.  It'll build up fast when you knock out opponents, catch some air, drift around corners, and any other fancy driving.  As the Blue meter fills up, icons will flicker in the surrounding environments when you can cause explosions to take out your opponents.</p><p>Once you fill two Blue meters, the third meter is Red.  Once the red meter is complete full, you can cause some serious explosions.  Like blowing up the flight control tower and crash it onto the race track.  Or blow up the road underneath your opponents exposing an underground promenade.  Or summon a 747 airliner crashing while trying to land on the runway.</p><p>The environmental effects of a Red explosion are huge and cause the landscape of the racetrack to change.  When you blow up the control tower, it blocks the track and racers need to go through hangers.  When you blow up road, you fall into a lower version of the track.  The changes create shortcuts, and more difficult areas.</p><p>Also, all the racers can blow up shit in the environment, not just you.  Things are blowing up all over the place once the computers think you're winning too much.</p><div class='title'><b>No HUD</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp"  /></p><p>One other very interesting thing about Split Second is the absence of a HUD (or Heads-up User Display).  There's no information on the corners of the screen.  As you can see from the screen shot, the place, laps, and explosion bar are tapered on the back of your car, which gives a very different driving experience than any other racer out there.</p><p>It's actually a pretty smart move since you need to pay attention to the environment around you, just as much as the cars in front of you.  The HUD would just get in the way.  And now you can see everything quite clearly.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Split Second is brought to you by Black Rock Studio, whose previous titles include Moto GP, Pure, and Hot Wheels Stunt Track.  Their past includes all racing games, but none of which have really made a name for them.  Split Second is definitely different, but could get repetitive very fast.</p><p>It was announced earlier this year, and should be release sometime in 2010.  Even though, it surprised me and I played it several times throughout the weekend, I don't plan on buying it.  It'll be at the top of my GameFly list, but I am skeptical the amount of enjoyment I'll get out of Split Second after playing it for 2 or 3 weeks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-the-brodeo-live-reunion">PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One year ago in two weeks, my favorite podcast recorded it's final episode, and did not return to the Internet.  The Brodeo starred 1up staffers Sean Malloy, Ryan Scott, Sean Elliot, Jeff Green, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.  On September 11th, 2008, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and on September 18th, Sean Elliot did the same.  I wrote a little bit about it on that day: <a href="/old/v7/the-brodeo-is-over" title="/the-brodeo-is-over">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=491</a>.</p><p>It was my favorite because they had the perfect blend of serious game discussion and deconstruction, mixed with clever humor and ridiculous bizarre stories.  Jeff Green spoke very candidly and honestly about his life and thoughts on games.  Shawn Eliott would regale ridiculous stories from the past, while going into depth about ideas and game design.  Robert Ashley would provide great commentary and further insight into the conversation.  Ryan Scott...  wouldn't say much.  Anthony Gallegos was a goof ball.</p><p>This round table always made the conversation revolve in the right direction that was entertaining and thought provoking.  If you haven't listened to GFW Radio, definitely check out all the previous episodes.  Yes, it's a PC podcast, but PC gaming is a very small component of what makes the podcast so great.  All the podcasts are still hosted at 1up.com's <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397">GFW podcast page</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>The Fans</b></div><p>Being at The Brodeo reunion was a reunion for everyone in the room.  It wasn't just a reunion for the Brodeo members, but all the fans, too.  All the fans listened, laughed, and thought in unison while The Brodeo talked about Diapered Anime fans, working in Game Development, playing games no longer being Journalists, Smoking poop, and the Truth behind GFW Magazine's end.</p><p>The Brodeo crew have a very unique voice, but the fans really bring out the best in them.  In fact, it was fan Aaron Simmer who contacted all the Brodeo members, raised money to fly them to PAX, created the Panel, reserved the room, and organized the entire event for them.  It was Bill Mudron who created this excellent Graphic for the reunion, printed out 200 poster sized copies, and sold them at the Panel for $2 to cover the cost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_brodeo/IMG_4935.webp"  /></p><p>(I was able to get all 5 Brodeo member signatures on my poster, too!)</p><p>And it was all the fans that showed up and gave their attention, their laughter and their questions that brought out the familiarity and comfort of being with like minds and friends.</p><div class='title'><b>The Reunion</b></div><p>Much like every episode of The Brodeo, they talked well past their allotted 1 hour mark.  And continued for an entire 2 hours and 15 minutes, complete with questions.

| September 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At PAX 07, Bioshock wasn't really that big of a thing.  The demo had been out for quite a while, and the game just came out that week.  It didn't really need advertising or a large presence.  There was a life-sized Big Daddy statue and several demo units, but that was about it.</p><p>This year, Bioshock 2 had a pretty small presence, but what they had was rather unique.  2k Game hired a chalk artist to sketch a poster in front of the main halls.  Throughout the entire weekend, the artist worked on transposing the tiny print into a massive 8 foot mural.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Jhonen Vasquez</b></div><p>Earlier in the year, Jhonen Vasquez, creator of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Squee, and Invader Zim, drew a picture that captured the twisted essence of the little sisters and their bigger guardians.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp"  /></p><p>2k Games brought Vasquez to Comic-Con in July (even though he would already be there for Slave Labor Graphics), and they did the same with PAX.  On Saturday, from 2pm to 4pm, Vasquez sat in Andrew Ryan's office signing these prints.  The one above is the one I got. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, Vasquez was only signing these prints and was not signing personal items. That's fine, since I didn't have any of that with me anyways.  I would love his signature on the side of my Invader Zim box set, or on the inside cover of Johnny or Squee.  Someday, but unfortunately, not today.</p><p>I did get my photograph taken with him...  sort of.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp"  /></p><p>In the background is his handler.  I did ask him if Vasquez could sign anything else, but he was the one that kindly told me, "no, sorry."  I chatted with him a little bit about when I might be able to get his signature and he suggested Comic Con next year.  Bahh...</p><p>If you were to guess what Vasquez's handler's voice sounded like, would you think it would be a deep rough lumberjack of a voice?  Perhaps a strong authoritative dialogue?  I'm afraid not.  His voice was straight out of Suburban Commando.  Semi-high pitched, with a very rich English accent, recanted with an apologetic smile.  Is that a typical voice for such a burly man in England?</p><p>I wonder if Vasquez attends comic conventions other than Comic Con.  Comic Con sounds like a shit load of lines, and huge price guaging.  I'm not even sure I would buy anything there, as I already have all the comics I need.  Plus, I hate Superhero comics, so it probably wouldn't be fun for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Bioshock errata</b></div><p>Those two events were really the only presence of Bioshock 2 at PAX.  There was a room in teh back that showed the E3 trailer over and over.  Those that watched the trailer were rewarded with a Bioshock 2 posters draw by Gabe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp"  /></p><p>It's hilarious comparing Gabe's drawing to Jhonen Vasquez's print.  Cute v. Creepy.  Calm v. Twisted.  <b>The ying and yang of Bioshock 2 art.</b><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Behemoth and Game 3 Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-behemoth-and-game-3-hands-on">PAX 09: Behemoth and Game 3 Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The revenue generated from their booth at PAX directly funds their upcoming games.  It's win/win.</p><div class='title'><b>Castle Crashers</b></div><p>Last year, having just released Castle Crashers, their merchandise was almost all focused on Castle Crashers.  They were selling shirts, figures, and the game.  I bought the full game from them last year that came with a fancy pewter medallion and a code for the game.  It was certainly more tangible that simply buying it through Xbox live.</p><p>Castle Crashers was definitely my favorite downloadable game last year.  After buying the game at PAX 08, we played it so much that I missed my flight home!  <a href="/old/v7/pax-castle-crashers" title="/pax-castle-crashers">Read all about it</a>.  This year I continued my patronage and purchased a statue of my favorite Castle Crashers character (for sale): The Red Knight.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp"  /></p><p>Steam Knight is actually my favorite, but they haven't made a figure for him.  Dan Paladin was at the Behemoth booth, so I asking him if he would sign my spiffy figure.  And he did!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp"  /></p><p>Also, there was a Castle Crashers cosplayer at the booth.  I'm pretty sure it was one of their friends or wives and not just a random fan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Game 3</b></div><p>The Behemoth booth had 4 stations setup.  One had PS3 Castle Crashers, and the other one had Game 3 setup on the Xbox.  I gave it a try and it seems like it might be fun.</p><p>Each game developed by Behemoth has been in a different genre, mostly in the retro realm.  Alien Hominid was a 2D sidescrolling shooter, ala Contra or Metal Slug.  Castle Crashers was a brawler ala Final Fight and TMNT.  But, Game 3 doesn't fall into a specific genre.</p><p>It's very much a multiplayer action game.  Again, it seems like it'll be fun, but I didn't really have that much fun with it at PAX.  The game mode we played had a floating whale that gave out coins.  You pick up as many coins at possible and deposit them in a floating bank.  The opposing team can knock you out and steal your coins, so be careful!  It was simple, and didn't have much more to it other than jumping around.</p><p>I love the art, though.  You can choose your head, face and weapon.  The faces range from stern to excited to intense.  The weapons can be defensive or offensive.  I played with a fan, which repeled most projectile weapons.</p><p>The Behemoth's Development Video #1 shows exactly how the game is played.  I didn't get much more out of the game having already seen this video.

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mass Effect has been the only RPG in recent years that actually hooked me.  Fallout 3 I found boring and dismal.  Fable II was ugly and too ridiculous.  JRPGs (except Final Fantasy XII) haven't had a unique or different story for quite a while.  But Mass Effect was a little different.  It was a fully realized NEW Sci Fi universe, much like Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, etc, etc.</p><p>There are very few games that create an in-depth detailed universe for their game that aren't in the MMO space.  There are even less that have a decent story that unravels through a decent plot and utilizes many aspects of that lore.  There's a lot of lore fluff that doesn't matter for the story of Jonathon Shepherd, but I find myself more interested in reading about these alien races, than some ancient Orcs v. Human battle in the WOW lore.  I think alien races have always intrigued me because they are so different from us, but still have the capacity for intelligence.</p><p>I'm quite excited for the sequel, so I was glad to get the chance to check it out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>One thing that was goofy about Mass Effect 1 were the dialogue scenes.  The dialogue wasn't goofy, but the way in which it presented always had a profile shot of who was talking.  That was the only shot they ever used, and it got boring fast.</p><p>The dialogue in Mass Effect 2 has a lot going on in the background.  The shots are more dynamic and have more interaction that just conversation.  For example: At the beginning of the demo, you hold a conversation in a car while flying to your destination.  The only interaction you have is conversation, but the shots change from a close-up in-car to a wide shot of the city's traffic, to a closer shot outside the car with character visible through the windows.  It's a varied and shows off how beautiful the environments are.  It's far more interesting that two people standing side-by-side holding a conversation.</p><p>The conversations towards the end of the demo has a whole lot of body movement and gestures that really enhance the actually dialogue.  It's like an actual movie now!</p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>Another "gamey" thing about the dialogue that has been altered is that the conversation choices are not so black and white.  After a while of playing Mass Effect 1, you'll realize that the 3 conversation choices on the right go in order of Good, Neutral, and Evil.  If you want to be good in the game, you'll most likely always say the top choice.  For evil, the bottom choice.  Why ever choose the middle?</p><p>It wasn't so easy to tell if the top choice was actually the "Good" choice towards the end of the demo.  In fact, choosing the top choice invoked a battle that I found out could have been avoided.  Maybe it was the Good choice and I appeared weak?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Other Thoughts</b></div><p>The demo was very very pretty.  It was pretty dark, but featured a rich color palette the made areas look very dynamic and cool.  A very Sci Fi style that is much more prevalent than the first game.  It looks great. ^_^</p><p>The action sequence also felt much different than Mass Effect 1.  I actually needed precision and strategy when fighting all the enemies, rather than blowing them all away with my sniper rifle or using my team as decoys.  It was kinda difficult.  I should've checked which class I was playing.</p><p>But overall, the game is pretty sweet.  It takes what made the original special and takes it to the next level and other box quotes.</p><p>Mass Effect 2 releases for Xbox 360 and PC in "Early 2010".</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/2009-9/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
