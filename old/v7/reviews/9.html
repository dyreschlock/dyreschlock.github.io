| July 31, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The other night, i simply had the itch to download and play some game on the Virtual Console.  I wanted to go back to the past and unearth an old game that i loved playing.  I wanted something with a lot of meat, that I could devote a couple hours towards and actually build something out of my time...  which pretty much eliminated all systems except for the Super Nintendo.</p><p>I perused the selections.  I had a real hankerin' to play Super Metriod, but the Virtual Console had a very surprising few games for the Super Nintendo and even less good ones to choose from.  Actraiser just happened to be at the top of the list (it was alphabetical).  Hot damn do I love this game.  So, in went $8 to virtual land.</p><div class='title'><b>Actraiser, you say..?</b></div><p>Actraiser was either a launch title or a near-launch title for the Super Nintendo here in America.  You basically play god and rid the world of evil monsters giving humanity a chance to develop and grow throughout the land.</p><p>The game is split up into 2 forms of gameplay.  On one hand, your spirit descends to earth and inhabits a Valkyrie statue which you control in side-scroller fashion killing monsters and an ending boss.  After that, on the other hand, your cherub partner floats above the surface as you direct the humans on which direction to expand their city.</p><p>Your level increases when the world reaches certain population milestones.  As the human grow and evolve, they invent tools and things, such as bridges, music, warm clothes, medicines..  You can bring these inventions to other parts of the land which desperately needs advancement.</p><div class='title'><b>Bliss</b></div><p>Actraiser is an absolute pure joy...  and part of what makes it so amazing is the wonderful soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who got his start composing music for the Ys game series.  Looking through his list of soundtracks, I think his most notable soundtrack just happens to be Actraiser.  The music is quite powerful and engaging.</p><p>Other wonderful little tidbits of Actraiser is the sense of advancement in the humans.  Once you initial expel monsters from a region, 2 humans are made and live in the main temple.  When you direct them to build their town, they start off building little tents and huts.  When they become slightly more advanced, they start building little houses out of wood and logs.  When they reach their highest advancement, their homes are quite suited to the environment they live in.  The desert region has stone houses capable of standing up against heavy winds and sands.  The more forest regions have stronger brick houses.</p><p>A lot of love went into this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Overall...</b></div><p>If you have 800 wii points to spend and are looking for a game with a little bit of action, but a lot of building.  Definitely check out Actraiser.  It is truly a gem of the past.</p><p>___</p><div class='title'><b>Elsewise...</b></div><p>After playing Actraiser, I remembered that it was published by Enix, which is now Square Enix, which has openly said that they will NOT be releasing any Virtual Console games.  Maybe they just changed their mind on Enix's properties during the 16-bit era and possibly other titles without the words Final or Fantasy in the title.</p><p>After playing this beautiful Enix title, I actually wanted to get my hands on Illusion of Gaia.  Another game developed by the same team.  I started looking some of this stuff up and Illusion of Gaia actually has several games in the series.</p><p>Apparently Illusion of Gaia is the second game of the series.  Soul Blazer is the first game of the series and appears to present a fantastic link between Actraiser and Illusion of Gaia.  I've never really heard of any of this before, so I'm quite exciting to see that Soul Blazer has the town building aspect of Actraiser, with the top-down action-rpg perspective of Illusion of Gaia.  That's fricken amazing.</p><p>I've never played Soul Blazer before, but if this comes out on Virtual Console, I will buy it that Monday.  I'm somewhat saddened that I hadn't heard of this game until now.</p><div class='title'><b>Wishlist..</b></div><p>Other games that I want to play on Virtual Console include: Illusion of Gaia (SNES), Super Metriod (SNES), Star Tropics (NES), Crusader of the Centy (Genesis), and Snatcher (Sega CD).</p><p>I'd also love to check out Terranigma, which is the sequel to Illusion of Gaia.  Unfortunately, Enix lost its company in America before they were able to bring it over, or else we would have had it.</p><p>Also, I'll probably pick up Zelda: A Link to the Past and Castlevania 4 at some point.  I'll probably make a stupid decision at some point and buy Super Mario Bros, as well.</p><p><em>Edit</em>: Actually, i thought of 2 others games I'd like on Virtual Console: Secret of Mana (SNES) and SD Snatcher (MSX)</p><div class='title'><b>By the way..</b></div><p>In case you're wondering, I have 3 Virtual Console games with the recent purchase of Actraiser.  My other two games are Gunstar Heroes and Sonic the Hedgehog 2<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Condemned" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/condemned">Condemned</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Condemned was one of those premiere games on the 360.  There was other more prominent first person games such as Perfect Dark Zero and Call of Duty, but Condemned was the one that really showcased the 360 graphically.  It was graphically superior to all other launch titles, had a very dark setting, and included its fair share of gore.  My roommate, Tyson, picked it up and I watched him play through the first couple chapters and it seemed like that's all this game was.  Your typical dark, gory first-person game that showcased the 360.</p><p>Today, some people still regard it as one of the 360's top 10 games.  "Is this the same game?" I thought.  "The same game that tries to be scary and edgy, but is really just a hodge-podge of sew together predictable plot devices we've seen in so movies B movies..  This game is a top 10 360 title?"  Well, it just so happens that this launch title was on clearance at Target for a mere $15.  Eh.. why the hell not.</p><p>Well, unfortunately Target didn't have any copies..  In fact, I don't think any of the Targets in Madison actually have any clearance games at all.  I remembered that Gamestop had some sort of sale back in May or June where this game was $20, so I went over there.</p><p>I remember correctly, but they, too, were out of new copies of Condemned.  They had plenty of used copies though for $25.  "What the..?  Is this right?" I asked a nearby employee.  "Yes actually.  We're out of new copies of Condemned, which we sold for $20.  However, we have plenty of used copies..  In fact..  10.. 11.. 12..  We have about 12 copies used for the low low price of $25.  It's really kind of odd.  Apparently suckers, i mean, gamers tend to buy used copies of 360 games more than new copies, so we try to keep a good stock of used games.  In fact, occasionally we open up new copies and mark them as used."</p><p>O_o..  "maybe it's because new copies of most 360 games are $60 which is entirely too high to ask your average gamer to pay for games..  why would i pay $25 for a used copy of the game, when i can buy a new copy of the game for $20?"</p><p>"well..  we're out of new copies of the game."</p><p>"ugh.. whatever, i don't really care.  I just want to give the game a chance."  For some reason, that little voice in head that calls me an idiot took a break.  I could have just rented the game for $8 at blockbuster, or possibly even bought an extremely cheap copy of the game from there too.  Oh well..  my completest collector instincts took over and thought that i'd probably end up liking this game, so i probably want to own it.  (and) Gamestop used copies (which are probably new copies opened up to look like used copies) are in much better condition than a worn out Blockbuster used copy which has had countless diseased hands touching and groping it throughout the past year and a half.</p><p>Well, i suppose i am pretty glad i picked up the game because it's not all bad..  it actually has some very nice points to it, but is riddled with too many annoying things.</p><div class='title'><b>It begins..</b></div><p>You are Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent sent into investigate another serial killing in the futuristic damp dreary setting of Metro City.  The city, itself, is overrun by jacked up thugs whose only release of sweet sweet violence, which has escalated 28 percent in the last year.</p><p>In the abandoned Weisman Office Building, there has been another killing in the Match Maker case.  During the investigation, it just so happens that the killer is still in the building.  In fact, you catch him escaping to the upper floors.  You and your partner take off in opposite directions to capture him.</p><p>This is all going on during the first chapter of the game by the way, so technically these would be spoilers.  Everything in the first chapters sets the story for the rest of the game when the chapters concludes.  You corner the killer, but he over powers you.  Takes your gun.  Kills your partner and a police man.  Then throws you out the window down 4 or 5 stories into a dumpster.</p><p>Bad luck, huh?  Well the bureau happens to think the killer was never present in the building.  They pin the murders of your partner and police officer on you, and you must escape from the law, while solving the crime and catching the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>How to play..</b></div><p>Condemned is your typical first-person shooter-like game, except guns are not your primary weapon of attack.  Melee weapons you can find all over the environment are your main sources of attack.</p><p>Grip #1: You can only have one weapon at a time.</p><p>Most things you can find lying around, you can walk up to and grab using the A button.  (a little icon will appear when you can do this.)  Some weapons are better than others, which you can compare in a little tool tip box that appears in the upper right hand corner.  However, there are some weapons you need in order to progress through the level.  You need a fire-ax to chop through some wooden doors.  A crobar can pry open weapon cabinets.  A shovel can destroy panels of electrically locked doors.  And the good 'ol fashion sledgehammer will break off pad locked doors.</p><p>When you get to a point where you need one of these weapons, you need to drop whatever kickass weapon you may already have.  So i need to drop my sub-machine gun with 20 bullets, to pick up a slow-ass shovel that'll get me into a room with 4 or 5 more enemies.  This is a good idea.  I usually end up running back and picking up the weapon i had before.</p><p>Anyways..</p><p>Combat really isn't all that in-depth.  You have a block and you have an attack.  Blocking attacks give you the opportunity to land quick counter-blows.</p><p>You also have a very handy taser, which conviently stuns enemies long enough to render dead with a shovel and not even have to worry about blocking or combat in general.  Your taser takes a little while to power up though, so you cannot spam enemies with it.</p><p>I usually taser an enemy, grab their weapon from them, and kill them on the next blow with their own weapon.  Then pick up the weapon I dropped and continue on my merry fugitive way.</p><div class='title'><b>Evidence tracking and gathering..</b></div><p>Something Condemned does have going for it is finding and examining evidence.  Hell.. you are a forensics officer.  You have equipment to track blood, take blood samples, look for other clues and take photographs.  You send all this stuff back to your friend at the bureau's lab.  Luckily, she trusts that you are innocent.</p><p>Going around tracking clues is fairly linear though.  There are no side quests where you might find another murder, or solve another crime.  Everything you find builds your case proving your innocence and tracking the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>Graphics..</b></div><p>The other thing condemned actually does have going for it are the overly detailed graphics.  You can really tell that this was the #1 priority for Condemned.  It is certainly one of the prettiest games I have seen on the 360.</p><div class='title'><b>Why do people love this game?</b></div><p>Ultimately though, what really makes this game great is the creepy dark setting.  You never once see daylight in Metro City.  Everything either takes place underground with the absence of light, or outside during nightfall.  Never once does your character experience the sun.</p><p>Hmmm... come to think of it.. this is actually a pretty clever trick to make the graphics artificially feel better.  The game has an incredible amount of detail, but there's no way you could pack this detail in a wide landscape.  I don't think you ever see any more than 40 feet in front of you.</p><p>Anyways, the darkness plays trick on you.  I mean, how is walking around in the dark with a bunch of jacked-up creeps with a taste for blood NOT scary?  And they love to jump out at you when you least expect.  It really keeps you on the edge of your seat and quite entertained, much like Silent Hill or Resident Evil.</p><p>One of the best scenes of the game is the abandoned mall.  by the way, every place that you go to in Condemned is some abandoned building.  An office building, the library, a school, subway station, the mall...  It wouldn't be creepy and full of hostiles if they weren't abandoned, right?</p><p>Anyways, the mall is all decked out for Christmas, but probably last year's Christmas.. or maybe the year before.  Various presents are found across the floor.  Piles of garbage collect in the corner.  Many displays have been shattered with the Mannequins inside beginning to decay.  All the while, you can make out a faint scratchy Christmas song over the intercom to wish you a Merry Christmas.</p><p>This is the fifth chapter in the game, so you've gotten to the point where you are really into the game.  You know how to play and what to expect from the game, but this brings the whole level up a notch.  Especially when you finally come across the enemies.  I won't spoil that..</p><div class='title'><b>The story..</b></div><p>The story itself is alright, but hardly pays off.  It reminds me of Zone of the Enders 1, where this game was meant to start off a whole franchise of story-concluding properties in the future.  I suppose, Matrix 1 was the same way.  "Well crap, we have way too much story to cram into one game.  We can't possibly introduce this world, create a compelling story, and conclude everything we start in one shot.  Let's put out what we have and create the definite game of the series at a later date.  We just need to get this one out now."</p><p>There's something to be said about this style of production.  I mean, how can you cram the entire story of a world into a game and still make it suspenseful and compact?  RPGs have been doing it quite well, but developers are under the impression that the average games does NOT want to spend 40, 60, or 80 hours on a single game.  You think maybe that's because you've stereotyped gamers into ADD children that want nothing but action?</p><p>It does make for a nice compact property though.  One game here, one game there.  Two stories in the same environment.  One that introduces us to the world, and one later that tears down that world and ties up all the lose ends.</p><p>Of course, I feel sorry for the sucker that pays $60 for each game in the series.</p><p>#1 Grip: The biggest absolute worst thing about the game is it's attempt to be linear at the very end.  <em>Spoiler: when you reach the end you are presented with the choice of killing the real killer, or not killing him. </em>  Its a tough decision that the game gives you 5 seconds to make up your mind.  Don't worry though.  Whether you kill him or not, does not change the actual ending.  Stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall, though..</b></div><p>.. Condemned is semi-short game that has some unique characteristics in a very very overdone style.  Do we really need another first person game on the xbox platform?  Is this game good enough that I can say it was well worth it to even produce in the first place?</p><p>Yeah, I guess so.  It definitely has its moments.  But there are so many other better first person games out there I probably should have played first.  I still haven't played Doom 3, or Half-life 2.</p><p>I guess the real test will be the sequel coming out this fall, which was another reason why I wanted to play this game sooner rather than later.</p><p>If Condemned 2 fixes the really annoying things about Condemned 1 and fully explains why the birds were dying and puts closure on the madness that engulfs Metro City..  and its not some stupid retarded explanation..  Then I would say that playing these games isn't a waste of time.</p><p>Condemned, on its own, is okay.  If you like first person games, you'd probably like this.  If you like spooky scary games, you'd probably like this.  If you don't like either of these types of games, then you probably won't like this.</p><p>Overall, i like it..  pretty much for the same reason explained in the 'why people like this game' section of this article.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I finally spent the chance to play more of Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, which came out about a month ago.  Some regard Resident Evil 4 as the best game of the last generation and I definitely agree that it's quite amazing.  With the Wii controls, better graphics than previous versions, and all the Extra bonus content, the Wii Edition proves itself as the definitive copy of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>About a month ago...</b></div><p>Man, I remember it like yesterday..  I had just moved into the new place, I made frequent posts on my blog..  That Tuesday, I stopped by Shopko looking for Resident Evil, but it was no where to be seen.  I got to my car and called a few places, all which indicated they would receive the game the next day.</p><p>After work the next day, I wasn't really in any rush.  I went out to Token Creek and played a round before stopped off at East Towne's Best Buy where I came into quite a shock.  "Hey my friend, do you guys get in Resident Evil 4 on the Wii?"  "We certainly did, consumer.  We had this entire rack over here filled up," the blue shirted employee explained as he gestured over to the now empty rack in the Wii section.  "guh!?  You guys are sold out?"  "undoubtedly"..</p><p>Crap..  I didn't take into account the popularity of this game.  It must've been advertised well.  "ummm...  well, does your West Towne store have any copies?"  A few brief moments of checking the computer revealed 3 copies remaining at the Best Buy near my house.  "Hot damn!  Thanks for the tip," as i rushed out of the store and into my car.</p><p>I guess this is what passes for adrenaline pumping, emotion driven task completion in my somewhat mundane boring life.</p><p>Thanks to the excruciating slow and dumb driving by the good people of Madison, WI, I did eventually reach the West Best Buy.  I frantically searched on the game shelves but found nothing until I checked one of the end-caps.  Huzzah..  It would seem that I have acquired the last copy at this location.  Ahhh.. that's a good feeling.</p><p>Anywho.. I spent the rest of the night playing it.  And also a good chunk of the weekend.  I beat the game once, and then proceeded through a second time earning money for the infinite rocket launcher.  I stopped at the point when I finally got it.</p><p>But as the week began, I got caught up in other things, and never really got back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Wii Gameplay</b></div><p>Resident Evil 4 is quite an amazing game and makes brilliant use of the Wii controls.  I find myself comparing this port against the other greatest game on the gamecube to receive a Wii port: Zelda - Twilight Princess.  I hated the Wii port of Twilight Princess.  The two things I absolutely hate about the Zelda Wii controls is un-precise sword controls and no camera control.  Both these are absolute non-issues for Resident Evil 4.</p><p>The Wii Controls add an amazing amount of attacking precise you use guns, rather than a sword.  Shooting a "Zombie" in the head could not be simpler.</p><p>The lack of camera is a non-issue because the game operate on a fixed camera to begin with, which lends itself perfectly for aiming and firing.</p><p>The gameplay was quite solid to begin with, but adding the extra precision of the Wii mote aiming brings it to a whole new level.  It's tough going back to FPSes on the 360 after playing Resident Evil 4.</p><div class='title'><b>Confession</b></div><p>This is the first time i've played Resident Evil 4, so it's not easy to draw the distinction between liking the game in the first place, or liking the game on the Wii.  So many people out there love Zelda on the Wii, but I think thats because they never got a chance to play the gamecube version.  When you fall in love with something, you grow loyalty towards that first initial experience and alike subsequent experiences won't measure up.</p><p>Some CAGers say they're in love with the Wii version of Resident Evil, despite playing through the Gamecube or Playstation 2 versions, but I'm not so sure I would be.  I have enough games I haven't played yet, to start playing a new version of something i had.</p><p>In that respect, I'm quite glad to have put off RE4 until now.  I'm also glad I played through Gamecube Twilight Princess before the Wii version.  Twilight Princess Wii is so gimmicky.</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>I do love this game quite a bit, and as mentioned earlier, I'm not the only one.  There are several things that bug me about the actual game design that would never have me saying, "greatest game ever"..  or even "greatest resident evil ever"</p><p>The gameplay, itself, is top notch.  Maybe that's why everyone is all about this game.  Resident Evil was in serious need of a gameplay revamp.  How stupid is a game where you can't even tell what exactly you're aiming at.  This problem reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 1.  For MGS2, they added in a first person view when firing your gun.  MGS1 did have some first person views, which is easily accomplished when all of your levels are 3D.  Resident Evil held onto the pre-rendered backgrounds a little too long, and in typical Capcom fashion pumped out a good 2 or 3 sequels before thinking about what they were doing.</p><p>That's all water under the bridge now, right?  Resident Evil 4 feels like a completely new game.  So much so, in fact, it doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game.  They made an action game out of an adventure series.  They even split up the game into bite-sized level and sub-level chunks.  It's kinda like mario, you begin on stage 1-1.</p><p>Instead of finding yourself in an expansive area with some doors locked and other doors unlocked and you find keys to these doors, and solve puzzles to open others...  You find yourself on a linear path for point A to point B with very little exploration..  it's all about killing the zombies.</p><p>For a Resident Evil standpoint, it is disappointing.  You can't really take it at face value either with the number 4 in the title.  It's part of a series.  Being so, it should follow more than just the overall story, it should follow the feel as well.</p><p>Honestly, I still think the best Resident Evil is #2, with #1 as second.  Resident Evil 4 is amazing, but it's a Leon side-story.</p><div class='title'><b>Speaking of story...</b></div><p>Why are Resident Evil games getting more ridiculous?  Code Veronica made Claire into some kind of super hero, and the main boss was a cross-dressing psychopath.  In Resident Evil 4, Leon is also some kind of super hero was precise knife-handling skills and fast reflexes.  Does initial contact with Zombies make you that much better?  I suppose, you'd probably work out quite a bit for fear of the next impending Zombie disaster.</p><p>meh..</p><p>Part of what makes Resident Evil 1 and 2 so eerie is how down to earth you feel.  You feel like regular people trying to survive.  Regular people with guns, of course.</p><p>I hope Resident Evil 5 really brings back what it means to find yourself in a weird mysterious place in the heart of a Zombie outbreak.  An actual entire town would be fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>Segway</b></div><p>Now don't get me wrong..  if you haven't played Resident Evil 4, definitely pick it up.  It is one of best games of the last generation, and, currently, is the best game on the Wii.  You will not find a better, more affordable complement to your Wii library.</p><p>In fact, you probably won't find it because Stores have been sold out since that initial release.</p><p>Thanks to Resident Evil 4, I cannot wait for Metriod Prime ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Earth Defense Force" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-earth-defense-force">The Earth Defense Force</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Finally, the reason to own a 360 is here.  I picked this game up about a month and a half ago, and haven't really put it down since.</p><p>In EDF, the alien invasion has begun, and they've unleashed hordes of mutated gigantic ants, spiders and massive mechanical robots.  Luckily, a few years prior to the alien invasion earth setup a defense force just in case such things would occur.</p><p>You play a lowly pion in the army, and choose from over 150 unlockable weapons to completely eradicate every enemy in sight.  There's really no story, no plot twists or character plots to get in the way of blowing the shit out of robots, gigantic insects and UFOs.</p><p>It's fricken awesome.  "Oh my god.. Ants are crawling up the sides of Tokyo. Blow them the fuck up.  Oh shit, here comes more.  Damn!  Spiders.  Holy crap!  Robots shooting lazers up my ass..  reload reload goddammit..  blow it up..  die!"  Building are completely destructible as well, so firing a rocket into a horde of ants 5 stories up with demolish that business.</p><p>It's really nicely detailed too..   Most large buildings has convenience stores on them actually modeled after REAL convenience stores.  There's a Lawsons, Daily Yamazaki, and others!  Rad-tastic</p><p>____</p><p>Something I just noticed today, though, is that this is actually a remake of the PS2 game which came out back in 2003.  Simple Series Number 31.</p><p>Luckily, Japan never frowns on bad games being made..  they actually encourage it.  Simple Series is a publisher that pretty much publishes games on concept alone, regardless of the end product, and releases it at a budgeted price tag.  Concepts like "a maid versus the mafia", "a bikini clad warrior out to kill zombies", "collecting infected humans in an ambulance before they turn into zombies", or simply.. "defending the earth against gigantic ants and spiders"</p><p>The Simple Series can be found on PS2, PSP and DS..  maybe PS1 as well.  Though, some of these games actually sell pretty good and get sequels and ports to next-gen machines.  Such as the case with EDF.</p><p>Something else I learned today is that 2 years ago, Sandlot made Earth Defense Force 2 (Simple Series #81) and one year ago, they made Earth Defense Force Tactics (Simple Series #103)..  Both these two games come out in Europe today.</p><p>____</p><p>Anyways.. if you own a 360, you owe it to yourself to play Earth Defense Force.  It was released as a budgeted title at $40, but you could rent it just the same. ^_^</p><p>Here's hoping we'll be seeing Earth Defense Force 2 on the 360 in the future.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Big Brain Academy impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/big-brain-academy-impressions">Big Brain Academy impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And much like Cooking Mama and Trauma Center, it is identical to the DS title with minor tweaks, changes and multi-player modes added.</p><p>Today I finally broke down and picked it up.  Knowing that $50 is way too damn much for this game..  Knowing there are only 15 mini-games in this whole package..  After checking blockbuster each day hoping they'd have it..  After keeping myself away from Best Buy, Shopko, and all those other places where I'd be tempted to purchase it..  Even after telling myself over and over again that I can just wait a week and Resident Evil 4 will be out on the Wii..  After all that..  I caught a thread on Cheap Ass Gamer, stating it was $40 this week at Circuit City.  and.. I came across an article which said I could get a free Wii-mote keychain.  So whatever..  I picked it up.</p><p>Bad Choice.</p><p>Big Brain Academy boasts its depth in bulking up and building your brain, but offers the most shallow presentation, gameplay, and overall quality on the Wii alongside Wii Play.</p><p>For single player modes you have training and practice.  With training, you delve through 5 areas of focus with 10 puzzles each.  For each area a weight is calculated to determine how massive your brain is.  These are totaled up and kept track of.  Sounds like fun eh?  As some of my old roommates said, "wow..  it's like they made a game based off of school that's actually as boring as school."</p><p>You also have practice mode where you can go through each area one by one, on any difficulty and get bronze, silver, gold or platinum medals for your successes.</p><p>Multiplayer has 3 different modes that use all these same games.</p><p>And... that's it.  I'm already fricken bored of it.  It does have a little connectivity online, but that's only to compare your brain's weight to others in your Wii address book.</p><p>Much like the DS titles, it seems like this is the type of game you play for 15 to 30 minutes a day and improve your brain's capacity.  That works great for the DS because it's a portable system.  It's designed for pick-up, play and put-away type games like this.  The Wii is a home console..  people don't spend full price on a snack size game when they expect a full meal.</p><p>Honestly, so far the Wii library has done a horrible job at making an actual compelling game to sink time into..  Luckily they ported Twilight Princess, so you can throw that argument back in my face.</p><p>Anyways, why didn't they just forget about the multiplayer, beef up the online connectivity, and release this as a $20 downloadable channel in Shop Channel?  It seems like such a waste to have this tiny game on an entire disc..  If I'm only going to spend 10 or 15 minutes playing it, I don't want to have to switch discs every single time.  I want it easily accessible like the 'Everyone Votes' channel.  Would you spend $50 for that?</p><p>If you really want to play this game, I suggest you rent it..  If you really want to buy it, though..  wait until it's $20.. or hell..  you could just buy it off me.  I already registered it for the Wii-mote key chain though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Indigo Prophecy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/indigo-prophecy">Indigo Prophecy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Graphics</b></div><p>New York is the center stage for the end of humanity.  Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast-2">End Gen Dreamcast (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Karous</b></div><p>Karous was released in February 2007. I found this game on my latest trek back to Japan in my local new/used gaming store. They actually had a couple copies of the game, and one copy used for $45. I did think it over long and hard whether i should buy this game.. It is developed and self-published by Milestone, who also made Radilgy and Chaos Field. Chaos Field was actually a rather fun game, and Radilgy looked pretty crazy.. so, by association, i laid down my 4500 yen.</p><p>Karous is a very minimalist styled shooter through and through.  The graphics are cell-shaded and drenched in deep dark blues, greens and greys, but complemented with other over-used bright white.  It probably looked like a good idea on paper, but in execution looks very unfinished.  When you use cell-shading, you must be very aware of shapes and forms and how shadows well bring out the simplistic complexity of your subject.  I think cell-shading is a horrible medium for shooters because you have no time to soak in the subtleties and models are going to be too tiny to see any detail.</p><p>Unfortunately they carry this throughout each level like a dead horse.  I don't know if they re-use the same environments, but each stage looks exactly the same..  I really can't tell the difference.  All the enemies have the same grayscaled colors, so the bosses really can't be distinguished from each other easily.</p><p>The game does not scale very well either.  I can hardly see what the hell is going on with the game on my TV.  In Yoko mode, you can't even see what level your weapons are at.  Tate mode really isn't all that much better either.  Aliasing abound!</p><p>Anyways, the minimalistic theme continues into the music.  The soundtrack features plenty of broken drumming, chimes, and lack of melody that produces very experimental sounds.  It's a very different approach to a shooter OST and i'm not really sure that it works out for them.  You have no sense of suspense or thrill when playing levels..  It really ends up bothering me more than pulling me in.</p><p>The gameplay works very similar to Chaos Field.  You have 3 buttons..  One for shoot, one for bombs, and one for sword.  Also, when you stop shooting you have a shield which is automatically deployed.  Each of these attacks have a separate color.  (Green for sword, Blue for shot, Red for bomb, and Yellow for Shield.)  When you hit an enemies, they'll shimmer in the color of which weapon they are weakest against.  Most shimmer in Red, but you'll get the occasional green or yellow.</p><p>Each of your weapons can be powered up through use or grabbing power-ups.  These power-ups usually come from drones of like enemies, or big ass enemies.  You'll usually get a little blue triangle which you can smack a couple times with your sword to power-up.  Also, i think just general firing and killing powers up your bomb.</p><p>Overall, this game is challenging, but i'd only recommend it as a last resort.  The graphics are actually pretty bad, and the music doesn't complement the gameplay well.  It's actually kind of annoying to play..  I guess i now know the reason why Tom Sawyer had so many copies of the game..  Oh well...  the gameplay does have some redeeming qualities.</p><div class='title'><b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b></div><p>Exelica is the most recent Dreamcast game which came up March 2007. Purple Godzilla in Seattle, WA showcased this game at Sakura-Con and had it for a very fair price of $65, considering it was nearly identical to the Japanese price of 6500 yen. I had seen Exelica in Japanese arcades before, and #five actually played a bit too. The gameplay looked very different than your normal shmup, so i figured, hell, i'd give it a shot.</p><p>In Trigger Heart Exelica, you play Exelica or Crueltear, two anime girls out to save or defeat their friend or foe.  You wage war against an onslaught of futuristic space ships in your flying power armor.  The game reminds me a lot of Shikigami no Shiro for some reason, even though the two games are completely different.  Massive points are obtained through collecting gold pieces from destroyed enemies and fire.</p><p>You have 3 attacks: normal fire, bombs and grapple.  Exelica and Crueltear have different shoot waves..  Exelica is rather spread out, while Crueltear's is straight on.  Bombs are as standard as ever.</p><p>The grapple technique is what makes this game so unique.  You can grapple nearly any enemy on the screen.  Bigger enemies will take a little longer..  Once you've captured them, they will shield you from oncoming bullets, and you can also smash them into enemies for massive points and damage.  When you move back and forth while holding an enemy, you'll swing back and forth..  swinging the enemy all the way around you will put you into a spin that'll almost shield you completely against enemy fire.  When you let go, the enemy goes flying and it's explosion destroys everything in the immediate area.</p><p>This makes some impossible to dodge areas essential for using the grapple technique.  There's one particular part in Stage 3 where the entire screen is jam packed with enemies..  you can't even get around them.  Not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of bullets..  Grappling one enemy and tossing him in the center of all that mess will clean out a lot of your obstacles.</p><p>The graphics are pretty decent.  They aren't crazy mind blowing graphics, but they are certainly don't suck.  The music also compliments the game quite well.  Unfortunately the sounds could use a lot more bass.  Blowing up things is MUCH more satisfying with a sound that you can feel in your body.</p><p>Overall, this game is pretty fun, albeit spinning around while grappling an enemy can be difficult to get the hang of.  A little nick picky thing that i don't really like is that you start off with infinite credits, rather than eventually unlocking more over time.  Starting off with only a set amount of credits will inspire you to get better at the game, and eventually push yourself to greatness.  Having the whole game laid out to you on your first sitting is very unrewarding.</p><p>$65 is a very steep price for this game though.  That money would be better spent on Under Defeat.  If you came across this game in an arcade, i'd definitely recommend a few coins of play to see if you like it.</p><div class='title'><b>The tears of the ages...</b></div><p>Unfortunately, this is the end of the Dreamcast.  As of February this year, Sega has officially stopped all production of the GD-Rom medium, and 2 week ago, declared that on September 28th, 2007, Dreamcast Repair Services will cease completely.  The Dreamcast lasted nearly 9 years in the marketplace...  not too many consoles can say that.  Of course, those companies have bigger better projects to focus on.</p><p>This doesn't spell demise for the Naomi boards..  In fact, Triangle Service is currently developing their latest shmup, Exzeal, for the Naomi cabinets and set to be released this year.  Triangle Service had previous released Trizeal in 2005 for the Dreamcast.  This doesn't guarantee a Dreamcast release though..  Trizeal has been ported over to Ps2 for a wider audience.</p><p>G.rev's most recent game, Senko no Ronde, was also Naomi GD-Rom, but was remade and updated for home release on the Xbox 360, which is coming to the US next month thanks to Ubi Soft.  Senko no Ronde is shmup fighter hybrid type game.</p><div class='title'><b>Since Naomi<br/></b></div><p>Though Naomi development still goes on with 3rd party Arcade developers, Sega has moved on.  Not that long after Naomi originally debuted, Sega released the Naomi 2 in 2000.  Naomi 2 was a beefed up Naomi board with more better everything.  Though, with the pending death of the Dreamcast, Sega began focusing on other hardware.</p><p>Namco had already taken a cue from Sega, and had partnered with Sony to release Playstation-like hardware in the Arcades..  With console sales heading the gaming industry, Sega looked to the other consoles for Arcade hardware.</p><p>In 2002, Sega released the Chihiro hardware based on the Xbox.  Sega made a few changes though by scrapping the DVD-Rom drive for a GD-Rom drive, and make the RAM expandable for upgrades.  They also made full use of the communication capabilities of the Xbox and developed a slew of networkable titles.  These games you could play against anyone else in an Arcade across Japan.</p><p>Sega continued with their idea of making porting games easy from Arcade to Xbox and Xbox to Arcade.. Unfortunately, the Memory upgrades were used heavily in the Arcade which made scaling games to the home unit difficult.  Wikipedia points out that Outrun 2 used 512mb memory in the arcade, while the Xbox had only 64mb to work with.</p><p>Also in 2002, Sega has teamed up with Namco and Nintendo to release the Triforce Arcade hardware.  Partnership and development centered around the Nintendo Gamecube hardware and the release of F-Zero AX/GX, one of my favorite games of all time.  This was also a good opportunity for Nintendo to get some market share in the Arcades again..  Aside from F-Zero, Mario Kart GP is the other notable release for this hardware.  Mario Kart 2 was released early this year.</p><p>I guess the Sega, Namco, Nintendo Triforce partership was the middle ground for all big-name console and arcade hardware developers..  Sega w/ Microsoft, Namco w/ Sony, and Sega/Namco in the middle with Nintendo.</p><div class='title'><b>Turning to the future, PC in 2004</b></div><p>In 2004, Sega released their current Arcade hardware, the Lindbergh.  It was originally going to be based on the Xbox 360, but eventually became PC based instead.  In fact, also in 2004, Taito released their current arcade hardware which is also PC based..  PC based machines offered far more extensibility for upgrades and stacking processors..</p><p>That's kind of the same direction the shmup community has been going as well.  Independently developed PC shmups have really caught the eyes of many circles.  Especially the Toho Project, responsible for Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night.  I haven't played any of these though, unfortunately.</p><p>Anywho.. i guess we'll see where Shmups will find their home in this new generation.  Senko no Ronde is on the 360, Gradius VI is coming out on PS3..  all while the Wii might be the best home with low publishing costs and a very retro community fanbase.  Most shmups these past years have found themselves on the PS2 because of how popular it is, rather than how identical the hardware is to its' original.  I'm sure that'll be the same in the coming years.</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming American Shmup Releases</b></div><p>April 17th.  Raiden III on Playstation 2 for $30<br/>April 27th.  Radilgy (Radio Allergy) on Gamecube for $30<br/>May 22nd.  Senko no Ronde (WarTech) on Xbox 360 for $60 ...  ugh :/<br/>Soon.  Ikaruga on Xbox Live Marketplace.</p><p>... and probably some other ones too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast">End Gen Dreamcast</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On January 31st, 2001, Sega announced that they would discontinue the Dreamcast and would focus on 3rd Party support for other home consoles instead.  The Dreamcast had a very short life which began in November 1998 in Japan, and September 9th, 1999 in America.  In February 2002, NHL 2k2 was the last game released in America..  However, life continues to grow in small reaches thanks its initial purpose and devoted fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallel Arcade Development</b></div><p>The Sega Saturn was really the first instance of Sega developing their home console along-side arcade Hardware.  In 1994, Sega released the Saturn in Japan, alongside their ST-V arcade hardware.  Since the hardware was nearly identical, games arcade games developed for ST-V could be ported near exactly.  Fans could play exact copies of arcade games on their home console.  The other difference was that ST-V arcade units took huge clunky cartridges, while the Saturn took standard CDs.</p><p>The Saturn was initially flawed due to its emphasis on 2D graphics, and last minute 3D graphical additions.  2D games looked amazing, but the populous was captivated by the 3D marvels other consoles and arcade hardware provided.  Sega lost support, but they learned from their mistakes... sort of.</p><p>Sega began development of the Naomi arcade boards, to be far more versatile.  The <b>N</b>ew <b>A</b>rcade <b>O</b>peration <b>M</b>achine <b>I</b>dea was developed with both 2D and 3D in mind.  Boards were set up to process in parallel, so you could just add another board and increase processing power.  (and) Machines were fitted to read from GD-Roms, Sega's proprietary disc format.  GD-Roms were just normal CD-Roms except data was compacted together for optimal storage capacity.  A normal 700mb disc, could hold up to 1.2gb of data.</p><p>This was extremely flexible for the developers..  The could now produce discs to distribute their games, rather than cartridges..  something the console industry had already been doing at this time.</p><p>The Dreamcast is a lone Naomi board, squished into a plastic case, ready for sale to the mass public.  In 1998, Sega released both the Naomi boards and the Dreamcast in Japan.  (and then) The Dreamcast pretty much died in 2002.  Few games released, first party support dropped, and a very healthy alternative: Playstation 2.  However, it was their Naomi boards that continue to spur life on thanks to a healthy underground game genre.</p><div class='title'><b>Shmups</b></div><p>Shmups is an audible abbreviation for Shoot 'em ups, or Shooters.  Such famous shmups include 1941, Defender, Gallaga, Asteroids, Gradius..  Games that involve some sort of airplane or space ship, dodging enemy fire and other obstacles, while shooting up enemies.  Shmups were somewhat mainstream when gameplay and graphics were simply, but began to go underground when mainstream games began to offer more.</p><p>Anyways..  Shmup companies turned to the Naomi boards for their cheap development and production costs, as well as, ease of porting to a home console.  Shmup companies continued to develop Naomi games and subsequently release them on the Dreamcast even after the consoles death.  Since 2003, the Dreamcast has had 9 shmup releases: Shikigami no Shiro 2, Psyvariar 2, Border Down, Chaos Field, Trizeal, Radilgy, Under Defeat, Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica..  as well as some hentai releases.</p><p>These Dreamcast games would not have been possible if not for the Naomi boards and the devoted fans of the Shmup community.  In fact, such after death support began to reach enough demand for Sega to re-release some Dreamcast units in 2006, packaged with Radilgy.</p><p>Most of these after-death titles have been ported to other consoles, and thanks to O3 (Sega's unofficial private US publishing company) some have even come to the states.  Chaos Field was released in America in Feb 2005 on the Gamecube..  Currently, O3 is bringing over Radilgy on Gamecube posed to release at the end of April.  They renamed in Radio Allergy, though</p><div class='title'><b>The Dreamcast lives on..  kinda<br/></b></div><p>Man..  my Dreamcast has seen better days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" /></p><p>One day when I tried playing Crazy Taxi, the disc would scrape along the tray cover.  I took it upon myself to fix this problem..  so I took off the case, tightened some screws, and reassembled it.  Well...  the CD had plenty of room to spin around, but the Dreamcast always thought the tray was open.  When I reassembled it, the tray no longer hit the little lever in the back :/  Nothing a little tape won't fit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" /></p><p>To play import games on my Dreamcast, i need a boot disc.  Something that took about 5 minutes of googling, and another 5 minutes of burning to accomplish.  When completely screwed together, my Dreamcast thinks the tray is either closed or open..  It can't detect open/close functionality..  So i help it along..  no biggie.  Thus my Dreamcast looks like Dreamcastenstien.  It has life..!  I have given it life..!</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>Throughout my travels across the earth, across the country, and across the internet, I've found myself in the position of purchasing the 3 most recent Dreamcast games:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" /></p><p>Under Defeat, Karous, and Trigger Heart Exelica, in order of release date..  After the Dreamcast Rerelease in 2006, They began publishing games with DVD style cases rather than CD cases.</p><p>So...  Are these games actually worth it?  well... here's what i think:</p><div class='title'><b>Under Defeat (Limited)</b></div><p>Originally released in early 2006, I found this game from <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/" title="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</a>.  I wasn't really sure if i was seeing it correctly, but they actually had copies of the Limited Edition version which came with the soundtrack.  I had heard Under Defeat was an amazing game, so i decided to order it.  Also, i think someone said the Limited version was super crazy rare, so that was also a deciding factor.</p><p>Under Defeat is developed by G.rev, which was founded by several Taito employees who had developed G Darius.  G.rev's notable works include Border Down, also on Dreamcast after its death.  G.rev is also noted for working with Treasure on their development of Ikaruga and Gradius V, two of the best shooters ever made.</p><p>Under Defeat does not disappoint.  You pilot a German attack helicopter in a modern version of World War II.  The helicopter will rotate right and left when you move allowing you to fire at an angle rather than straight on the whole time.  You get 3 bombs to start off with that launch an air strike upon the ground..</p><p>The little bit of innovation comes into, what they call, an option.  When you hold your fire long enough, a little green bar will fill up in the lower left hand corner.  When it flashes OK, you can begin firing again, and you'll release a little pod which will fire upon your opponents.  You can grab other power-ups that will change its weapon: Vulcan, Cannon and Rocket (from weakest and frequent to strongest and less frequent).</p><p>All kills this little guy acquires will net you double points.. and Therein lies the secret to obtaining massive points: Have the option kill as many high point gainers as possible..  especially laying the final blow on bosses.</p><p>The gameplay is very easy to pick up since it is rather basic..  The sounds and graphics add that extra icing on the cake that makes this game great fun.  The game plays 2D, but the graphics are in full 3D featuring rich textures and distinguishable colors and models to make enemies noticable and prominent.  Bullets are pretty easy to spot too.</p><p>Stylistically, smoke and explosions plays a extra role..  Whenever you fire a bullet a little bit of smoke emits from your cannon.  The Bullet flies through the air and hit your target with a little bit of smoke residue.  When enemies die, there's a little bit of pause as its engulfed in flames and bursts from explosion.  The fiery orange sparks from the enemy but is sharply over powered by black smoke.  The smoke stays in the air, and eventually fades away from the sky..   Sometimes, if you aren't heavily shooting up an enemy it'll blow up a little and fall to the earth underneath emitting a smoke trailed descent.  Another explosion results in the impact, with more smoke.</p><p>Under Defeat is an amazing joy to play, albeit just a little bit difficult.  I would definitely recommend any casual fan of the shooter genre to check out this game.  Much like Border Down, it will most likely stay on the Dreamcast, so if you do find a copy online for around $50, that will probably be the cheapest you'll get it for.</p><p>Buy from import retailers who support these companies by buying their products in the first place.  With out community support, we wouldn't even have these games at all.  In fact, Ncsx still has copies of the LE version in stock: http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/T-46704M.html  .. if you're a fan and you have the money, i'd say it's worth it.  Then you can say, "Yes..  i am responsible for the Dreamcast refusing to die."</p><div class='title'><b>More to come...</b></div><p>I'll get my impression of the Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica up in the next couple of days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Trauma Center Wii" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/trauma-center-wii">Trauma Center Wii</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As indicated by the previous articles, a couple of weeks ago i purchased a Wii.  A thread on Cheap Ass Gamer stated that Wal*mart was holding on their shipment of Wii to be released on that coming Sunday.  So, that sunday, i woke up at stupid o'clock in the morning, put on my jacket and drove over to Wal*mart.  It was only 5 minutes away from my house anyways.</p><p>I got their 15 minutes before they opened, and received the number 17 to indicate my place in line.  Apparently, this was more well known than i thought.  They had plenty of Wii machines to go around, though.  I got home and went back to bed for a little while.  Later on that day, we hooked it up and started messing around with Wii Sports, but got bored of it.  I wanted something fun to play that took advantage of the Wii-mote's capabilities.</p><p>I went out and picked up Trauma Center as my first Wii title.  I thought this was rather nostalgic since Trauma Center was also the first title i purchased for my DS.  I got home, put it in, and started to play.</p><p>For some reason, i thought this was a brand new game.  Since the full title of the game is "Trauma Center: Second Opinion", i thought that meant this was Trauma Center 2.  They couldn't really make a sequel of Trauma Center DS, but they could've had more doctors in other parts of the Trauma Center universe.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trauma Center Wii is a port of the DS title.  The story, characters and surgeries are the same fun missions you tackled on the portable venue.  How disappointing..</p><p>They did add another character at the last minute.  When you complete a story arc, you unlock another story with another character.  These missions take full advantage of the Wii controller.  In the first mission, you twist the Wii-mote to place a shattered broken bone back together.</p><p>On its' own, Trauma Center really starves the player.  The gameplay really lends itself to an Arcade setting, but the bulk of time spent in game is reading character dialogue.  The player sits through boring text until they finally get to experience the action and fast-paced setting of the surgery gameplay.  As far as i know, you can't skip this dialogue..  i should look into that.  Unfortunately, if they removed all story and just had a bunch of surgeries, the game wouldn't have any depth.</p><p>The gameplay is where Trauma Center really shines.  You have several different tools that you switch back and forth through while performing the surgery as outlined in the dialogue.</p><p>I'm not really sure which version of Trauma Center i prefer.  In the DS version, you have the extra precision of pinpoint pen strokes on the touch screen, but with the Wii version you have the speed and agility of an extra controller to switch between instruments.</p><p>There are other little differences as well.  On the Wii version, you actually use the defibrillators rather than the nurse automatically doing it for you.  Using the healing touch i've found to be much more difficult, but i think i just need to get used to the timing.</p><p>Anywho, i do love Trauma Center, but there are many downfalls that make it difficult to recommend to people.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-3">Twilight Princess (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, i finally came across Twilight Princess on the Wii for a cheapy price tag, so i picked it up.  Thinking back, i'm not really sure why.  In the past two months i've started 6 games that i have not finished.  These games would be Portrait of Ruin on DS, Final Fantasy XII on PS2, Cooking Mama on DS, Hotel Dusk on DS, Trauma Center on Wii, and Picross DS on DS.  I've been playing Picross quite a bit, but the other games are becoming lost causes..  Starting ANOTHER game would be foolish right?</p><p>Whatever..  i want a fun Wii game that i can sink time into.  I like the Wii quite a bit, but i'm stuck in Trauma Center, and Wii Sports and Wii Play don't really hold my interest.  The only other game i play quite a bit on my Wii is Gunstar Heroes, but i'm getting my assed kicked on Level 5.</p><p>Anyways..  i bought Wii Twilight Princess and started playing it yesterday.  There's a pretty stunning difference between the gamecube version and the wii version of the game, which everyone already knows about.  Traditionally Link is a left-handed sword wielder, but the vast majority of earth's population are right-handed sword wielders.  Rather than re-code Link's physics or model, they decided to mirror the entire game.  In other words, Right is Left and Left is Right.  Now link is right-handed... i guess.</p><p>I didn't think this would really bother me at all, but i find myself getting lost every now and then when i'm trying to find a house or navigate throughout the world.  Dungeons are pretty easy though, since i hadn't spent nearly the amount of time i have in villages or the world overall.</p><p>The obvious difference is most certainly the controls.  I'm not a big fan of the Wii controls.  Aiming with the slingshot, boomerang, etc is FAR better with the Wii-mote, but sword play is way too flexible.  On Gamecube Twilight Princess, you just hit the B button to slash and beat up things, but on the Wii you swing the Wii-mote back and forth motion which loses a lot of precision.  It's far worse than using an analog PS2 controller for a fighter..  The jousting event took me about half an hour to finally figure out when the sword actually swings when i jerk the Wii-mote to the side.  With the Gamecube controller, you hit the button and Link swings the sword right then.  Precision is key when you come to events based on timing and the Wii-mote doesn't offer that type of precision.  I eventually figured it out, though ^_^</p><p>The other thing that annoys me is the lack of camera views in the Wii version.  On the Gamecube controller the C-button left and right would move the camera left and right.  The C-button up and down would pull and push the camera away from and towards Link.  Unless i'm missing it, there is no camera movement in the Wii version at all.  I've been using the Z button to correct the camera's placement.</p><p>They should've used the D-pad for the view changing, but ended up using that to store weapons.  In this way, Link can have 4 total weapons out at once rather than 3 in the Gamecube version.  The Wii controller is a little disadvantage for button mapping though.  Both controllers have 8 buttons, an analog stick and a D-pad, but the Wii controller lacks that C-button stick on the Gamecube controller.  So, rather than code around this problem, it seems that they just omitted camera controls from the game.</p><p>Unless i'm missing something..  I'm probably missing something..  maybe you can do Camera control with the B button on the Wii.  I dunno..  i'll try that out tonight.  oh wait...  B button is for items..  i shall consult the instruction manual.</p><p>Anyways, I still prefer the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess for a few reasons.  1) It was designed and developed to take advantage of the Gamecube, whereas the Wii is just a port.  The whole mirrored world thing is pure proof of that, which removes the traditional left-handed Link.  2) The sword swinging feels too loose, and lacks the precision that a simple button push provides on the Gamecube.  and 3) I'm probably bias towards the Gamecube version because i played through it before the Wii version.</p><p>I dunno.  I think that if i had played the Wii version first, i probably would've liked the feel of the controller better, but be annoyed about the aiming schema. :shrugs:  I guess we'll see what happens...  It's still the great amazing game you must play if you own a Gamecube or a Wii.  Quite possibly the BEST gamecube game ever made. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/10">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/8">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
