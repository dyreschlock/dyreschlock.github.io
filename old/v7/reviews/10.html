| February 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Yesterday, Nintendo released a simple game for the Wii with a similar release style as was the case with Wii Sports.</p><p>Wii Play is just 9 simple little 'flash' style games that are 'guaranteed' to build your skills using the full capabilities of the Wii-mote.</p><p>These 9 games are:<br/>Duck Hunt<br/>Memory<br/>Some weird bubble game<br/>Ping Pong<br/>Air Hockey<br/>Pool<br/>Fishing<br/>Cow Racing<br/>Pocket Tanks</p><p>There was talk of this game being difficult to find, and it was a nintendo release, so i figured that i should look into picking it up. Part of this rarity stems from the game being packaged with an additional Wii-mote. The game is priced at $50, with a $40 controller.</p><p>Anywho, when i got to Best Buy yesterday, they actually quite a large pile of them. I was kinda surprised with the frenzy i've seen about the Wii.</p><p>I got home, and started playing through some of the games...</p><p>ugh... Each and everyone of these games are shallow, and they don't offer new or innovative gameplay. It's like a bunch of unpolished tech-demos Nintendo scraped off the floor into a bag. I played it for about 2 hours yesterday with my roommates, and i'm honestly bored of it already.</p><p>The other problem with this game is it's only 2 player. I probably would've gotten a couple more hours of enjoyment out of this game if they added 4 player support.</p><p>Honestly, if you want a bunch of stupid games that test your wii-mote skills buy <span style="font-weight: bold">Rayman</span>. Rayman has about a ba-gillion mini-games which actually require skill, uses the wii-mote is many different ways, has decent graphics, and occasionally is funny.</p><p>The only going for Wii Play is that it equates to a $10 game, and comes packaged with another controller for your Wii.</p><p>It's hard to pass up though. I think that even if i read this, i'd probably still buy it because, hell... it's $10 for something to play on my Wii and another controller.</p><p>:shrugs: oh well....<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-2">Twilight Princess (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>hurrah..  i just beat Zelda at 41 hours.</p><p>So many aspects of this game pay homage to 'A Link to the Past' and 'Ocarina of Time'. After playing through Twilight Princess, it really feels like Twilight Princess is the next milestone or progression in The Legend of Zelda series. It adds so much more to the franchise than i thought Wind Waker did.</p><p>As a whole, it feels like there are 4 main Legend of Zelda games: The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess. All the other ones feel like side stories.. different takes on the series, in gameplay, setting, and story.</p><p>Anywho... i think one of the main strengths of Twilight Princess is it's nostalgic feel. But, i also feel like that really holds it back at the same time. The 'video-gamey' sound effects really break the reality in my opinion.</p><p>The music is kinda the same way. Some of the best music in the game are newly composed tracks for the dungeons. Some of the later ones have a very wicked unworldly feel. The nostalgic tracks are just the same symphonically composed songs you've heard over and over again. I think they would've been more successful if the old melodies were subtly inserted into newer compositions.</p><p>but..... whatever ^_^.  Twilight Princess is pretty damn amazing.  Certainly worth the wait.</p><p>I should probably order a year of Nintendo Power so i can get the Soundtrack while it's still available... hmmm... i wonder if i could just buy the soundtrack from the nintendo store instead.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 31, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>oh my good lord, i love this game..</p><p>before coming back to the states, i ordered a copy online since they had been several rumors that the gamecube version was going to see a very limited release. of course, upon being in the states, i've seen copies all over the place for gamecube. in fact, it's easier to find on gamecube than on the wii.</p><p>anyways...</p><p>after getting stuck in Portrait of Ruin, i decided to start my game of zelda and i finally put down the controller after 14 hours.</p><p>this game is phenomenal.</p><p>the graphics are beautiful. the charcters, the environments, everything looks amazing.. it is very similar to Shadow of the Collosus, though, actually, shadow has a more realistic natural feel to it. Zelda still retains the cartoony unrealistic feel thanks to character design, which i think takes away from the majestic nature it tries to portrey.</p><p>the story is rather wicked and darker than most other Zeldas, as to be expected from all the hype. The notion of darkness engulfing hyrule is presented with eerie sounds and an ambient supernatural soundtrack. darkness, in the case of twilight princess, is known as twilight, which is where the title derives it's name from. the animation and graphics compliment the sound beautifully.</p><p>link has the most expression out of any previous game. despite that fact he still does not speak on screen, he has an amazing range of emotions that will still convey his dialogue for the story. he shows empathy, disgust, and madness throughout the story, so far, which are emotions i've never felt from a previous zelda game.</p><p>the gameplay is good old legend of zelda style. same old, same old. no jumping. the dungeons and puzzles so far, have been quite entertaining.</p><p>one thing they've added that i've wanted in zelda game ever since Ocarina of Time was a time gauge that told me how long i've played the game.</p><p>anyways... i can't really remember the last time i played a game for 14 hours straight, still wanting more. i only stopped because i was getting hungry, and wanted to eat something a little more substantial than chips.</p><p>after 14 hours through the game i've only made it to the 3rd dungeon. in standard zelda style, they are usually the first 3 dungeons, then you fight something in hyrule castle. After that, something crazy happens to the world, and you must trek through another 8 dungeons. Unfortunately, the 8 dungeons is where Wind Waker failed. though we've been promised by nintendo that there are more dungeons in Twilight Princess than any previous zelda game. that would make Twilight Princess a pretty goddamn long game.</p><p>anyways... i love this game and won't be playing Final Fantasy XII or any other unplayed game sitting on my shelf for a little while longer. wheee</p><p>by the way..  i named link "Billy" and the horse, epona, "Blacky" to experience Twilight Princess in true Crystania fashion.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phoenix Wright owns" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phoenix-wright-owns">Phoenix Wright owns</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 15, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>about two weeks ago i got my DS lite and immediately started playing through the games i already own. i started off with Trauma Center and Castlevania with a little Tetris DS on the side. Trauma Center gets rather frustrating at times, so i began focusing on Castlevania quite a bit more. The other day i beat it, and today i finished going through it a second time. I'm somewhat burnt out on it now, so i decided to start playing Phoenix Wright and give Castlevania a rest.<br/>___</p><p>Phoenix Wright is a text-adventure based game where you have two settings. One setting is in the court room, and the other is outside of the court room.</p><p>When you're in the court room, the prosecution lays out their case and brings witnesses to the stand. Dialogue is spoken back and forth, usually comical ^_^. The gameplay of the court room is when you cross-examine the witness on the stand.</p><p>Each part of the witness testimony you can 'Press', as in, press the witness to clearly state what they mean by what they say, OR you can 'Present', as in, present evidence to teh court that shows a clear contradiction in the witness testimony. Usually the witness will restate their testimony so you'll have to find flaws in that. It keeps going until you clearly show they're lying. (so far, anyways)</p><p>The entire 1st chapter of Phoenix Wright is in the court; however, the second chapter features the other part of the gameplay.</p><p>Outside of court, the gameplay is exactly the same as Shadowgate, Deja Vu, and, of course, Snatcher ^_^. Look, Move, See, Do.. or in other words, Talk, Move, Examine, Present for Phoenix Wright. You move around locations you know of talking to people, searching for clues and gathering evidence for you case.<br/>___</p><p>The stylus is all you need when playing Phoenix Wright. Click, click, click. Although, instead the stylus, you can use the directional pad, buttons, and microphone. Holding down the Y button will activate the mic when appropriate. Instead of clicking on 'Present' during the court proceeding, you yell out OBJECTION or 'take that' to show the contradictions in the witnesses testimony.<br/>___</p><p>I think i read somewhere that Phoenix Wright has only 5 chapters. And after playing for about 3 1/2 hours, i've completed 2 of them. Chapter 1 only took about a 1/2 hour though. Chapter 2 was very involved.<br/>___</p><p>The gameplay is somewhat basic, but the story and the characters MAKE this game. The story moves rather quickly, and (even though it's sort of linear) you feel like you have control over the story. I think there were two parts that could have gone differently so far, but didn't affect the overall outcome.</p><p>It's pretty funny too. When any character is caught in a lie, or surprised, they have such grim animations for the facial expressions. It's very Anime-esq. Megaton told me that there were alot of Phoenix Wright doujinshi out there, and i can totally see why.<br/>___</p><p>Honestly ... this game is fantastic. widely entertaining, funny, intuitive. definately a must PLAY for any gamer.</p><p>I mentioned to Tony that Snatcher or Policenauts would make a perfect transition to the DS. Looks like Capcom beat them there with a completely new game instead ^_^. Honestly, i think Snatcher has been ported to death, but i'd love to see Policenauts make it stateside for once. A DS port might be the answer. even though Policenauts is almost 10 years old.. -_-;;</p><p>man.. the DS has some amazing games. Trauma Center, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, Phoenix Wright, Tetris DS.. and i haven't even touched Sonic Rush to its full extent. A++<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gamecube - Odama" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gamecube-odama">Gamecube - Odama</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 10, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>so today, i decided to check out K-marts video game selection since i heard there were some deals.. unfortunately i was misinformed, but they did have Odama which was supposed to come out on wednesday, so i figured i should grab it since i was there.<br/>____</p><p>Odama is a real-time strategy pinball game. The point of each level is to command your troops across the battlefield transporting the Ninten Bell from your end to the gate at the enemy's end. You command the troops using the gamecube microphone which is included ^_^. "press forward", "advance", "move left", "fall back" are all phrases spoken into the microphone to guide your army.</p><p>those commands are spoken while controlling the Odama, a gigantic ball rolling across the battlefield flattening both friend and foe. You have flippers on your side to knock it around the field.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" /></p><p>most objects in the field have to be taken out in order for your army to advance.<br/>____</p><p>So far i've only played it for a 1/2 hour before getting back to homework, and i really enjoy it ^_^. It is very challenging since you must be accurate with the Odama to knock over certain houses to gain items, or hit buildings that'll turn into bridges.</p><p>Doing two things at once is challenging enough, but to keep track of how much of your army is dying in battle and making sure your pinball does get lost adds complex natures to both your tasks.</p><p>"luckily, by the end of this game you'll be a god at pinball"</p><p>it might be easier to have one person control the troops, and the other control the odama, but probably not as fun.</p><p>definately worth a look ^_^. i'm debating whether or not to bring it to SPAMM tomorrow.</p><p>it's $50 at k-mart which is a bit pricey. This will probably be one of those games that'll have a short print and then disappear, so i don't regret the $50. Though, i'll probably do a little switch with best buy since they have a $5 coupon for this week.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-perfect-dark-zero-impressions">Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>For the past couple of weeks, there has been a steady stream of xbox 360 things in my living room.. First there was a controller, then a memory card, then Perfect Dark Zero, and then tuesday night, there was an Xbox 360.</p><p>I watched my roommate play PDZ a little bit, but i wasn't really all that impressed.. the graphics looked hokey, and the character movements were pretty primitive.</p><p>After my rough day of studying, testing and finishing up projects, and between playing Chaos Field i decided to check it out since it was just sitting there.<br/>________</p><p>The Xbox 360 is differently designed than all other systems i've played before.. including PC games. When you start up the Xbox 360 and it loads a game, the 360 requires a login. the 360, not the game. You can have multiple profiles on one 360, and each profile needn't have Xbox live. But you must be logged in to play games.</p><p>The game uses this profile for saving progress, records and other data, besides the most import use of having an Xbox Live persona. Each account has it's own settings and data for every game played with that profile.</p><p>So unlike PC games, ps2 or gamecube where each person would have a seperate save file for their data, all data is organized by profile, so if you want your stuff, you only need log in the 360 under your name and the system tells the game which file to load for you.</p><p>very impressive. data management is a snap.</p><p>The wireless controllers have a more user-friendly design than the wavebird controllers. Once you start up the machine, you hit the Xbox button on the controller. It'll assign itself to the xbox, and then light up part of the Xbox button showing which player number it is. This is also represented on the front of the 360 showing how many controllers the system recognizes.</p><p>I'm not quite sure what'll happen when you have 2 Xbox 360 consoles next to each other and attempt to register controllers.. I wonder how they solve this problem.</p><p>Aside from that, it REALLY REALLY REALLY annoys me that the Xbox 360 isn't backwards compatible with every Xbox game. I can play Fable, but i can't play Metal Slug 3 or Fatal Frame 2 or Panzer Dragoon Orta or Crazy Taxi 3. worthless... that was my saving grace for buying some of these games. i could play them now on other's xboxes, and later i can play them on my xbox 360. so much for that one.<br/>_________________</p><p>anyways, my roommate is a huge console fps fan, so naturally he picked up the Xbox 360's flagship title: Perfect Dark Zero.</p><p>PDZ is pretty dissapointing in my opinion. This opinion is pretty justified when my roommate came home last night with a copy of Quake 4 to play instead of this game.</p><p>Perfect Dark Zero is exactly the same game it was 5 years ago with alot of graphical upgrades. The AI will not use any clever tactics to try and take you down. An enemy will not think twice of walking into a room that has your gun fixed on the door. Every single time, i can pop outside and fire a clip. Then duck back into the room, and wait for their slow ass to run in the room, stand in front of me and wait a second for me to shoot them dead.</p><p>Not to mention that the character animation is so stoic, it looks like they used the same animation from the Nintendo 64 game. It feels exactly the same in appearance. how lazy can you be....</p><p>so far i've made it up through Mission number 5 at this point, and the story is absolutely cliche and horrible. Joanna is presented as Lara Croft clone with her veteran pal, Joe, presented as a Bruce Willis clone. Halo 1 and 2 are FAR more interesting than this game, even they are pretty cliche as well.</p><p>Playing this game is pretty annoying, but it's rather addicting at the same time..</p><p>The graphics haven't blown me away at all... there have been some things i've stopped to look it and thought, "that's looks pretty neat.." But then i turn away and get back to the mission. Most of the graphics are have pretty standard for Playstation 2, but the powerful lighting effects of the Xbox 360 pull everything together to give it a clean crisp shiny look.</p><p>On occasion though, the lighting effects look really hokey. Especially when you're infiltrating this chinese palace covered in snow. The snow gives off a blue hue in the moonlight night, but the orange from the fire defuses the reality and makes the enviroment look CG.<br/>____________</p><p>anyways... Perfect Dark Zero thus far has been pretty unimpressive, but it's still kinda fun.. from the purchase of Quake 4, it obviously won't hold over my roommate until Halo 3 comes out next year sometime.</p><p>I'd like to see some great games on the machine though. Fable 2 should be amazing. I really hope they bring Tetris the grand master stateside. I also look forward to Ninety-Nine Knights, Blue Dragoon, and a few other games.. maybe even Final Fantasy XI and Rumble Roses XX.</p><p>The Xbox 360 is pretty well designed, but it feels more like an Xbox 1.5 than a whole new system. The Xbox 360 graphics don't look ALL that better than the Xboxes.. for the time being, anyways..<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Your 20 Favorite Games of all time" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/your-20-favorite-games-of-all-time">Your 20 Favorite Games of all time</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

"i know what my top couple games are.. but what are all my top favorite games of all time.. there are so many games that i've played over the past 20 years.. could i possibly remember them all?".. well i think i have, and i assembled a list that i think is a perfect representation of my top 20 games of all time..</p><p>you may notice that my list is 21 games, and not 20.. well, after making my list of games i forgot about Gran Turismo, so i had to add it in there somewhere and i just couldn't knock off my 20th game.. i'm sure i'm missing some games too.. anyways...</p><p class='img'>21. <b>Ultima Online: The Second Age</b> - Origins / PC / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/uo.webp" /></p><p>i just couldn't bump it off the list.. it's the first MMORPG i played, and i loved it quite a bit, even though all i did was mine ore north of britania all day long, and then occasionally go on adventures. i had some great times, playing with my friends from art college, although i never got into PK'ing people as much as they did.. one time they came back with a house deed. oh man, a few moments i felt bad for that poor schmuch eager to make his home amogst the forest.. but that went away when we made that home our home ^_^.</p><p class='img'>20. <b>Fzero GX</b> - Sega/Nintendo / Gamecube / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/fzerogx.webp" /></p><p>Racing has always been a favorite genre of mine.. thanks to wipeout and gran turismo.. although, for me, that genre was brought by games like Need for Speed and Test Drive.. games based on the action aspect of racing, rather than depth. although Fzero is similar to NFS and TD, the action, graphics and enviroment add to atmosphere and topped with excellent music ^_^. Fzero GX brought life back into the sub genre of futuristic racing where Wipeout Fusion had failed..</p><p>I loved this game from the very start, but it wasn't a soft love.. this game had such learning cliff, must people never played it for too long because they couldn't get anywhere in it. Even though i failed numerous times, i had a blast.. so i kept getting better, inch by inch passing the games little tests. This was a game you had to work at, and i loved every minute.. even the times i couldn't withstand how pissed i was for getting knocked off the course at the very end of a grand prix. ^_^</p><p class='img'>19. <b>Ikaruga</b> - Treasure / Gamecube ver. / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ikaruga.webp" /></p><p>Another game that was tough as nails.. One that you had to work at and understand in order to play it to the best of your ability.. It a beautiful mix of complexity and chaos, where patterns exist, and deciphering the patterns is just the first part of learning the game..</p><p>The first time i played this game was thanks to #five, who burned it for the dreamcast. tough as hell.. when the 'ol spamm house played this game, we couldn't get past stage 2. although it wasn't until i played it during the christmas break on the gamecube that i really got into it, as i did just a little better than i remember.. stu and i played the game the whole weekend trying to get just a little bit further, and a little bit further.. we were hooked ^_^.</p><p class='img'>18. <b>Megaman 2</b> - Capcom / NES / 1989<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman2.webp" /></p><p>this was the first megaman i played.. and also the first megaman i beat.. although i never owned it, i rented it on at least 4 seperate occasions.. the whole robot theme fighting other robots appealed to my nerd nature, and i fell in love ^_^.</p><p class='img'>17. <b>Rez</b> - Sega/UGA / Playstation 2 ver. / 2002<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rez.webp" /></p><p>earlier on in the decade, i used to check NCSX everyday to learn of imports, and other various games of the japanese nature.. This game showed up one day, and i had no idea what it was.. it came out in japan for $80.. just a bit too pricey for me at the time, so after half a year passed by and saw it on the release date list at eb, i picked up their last copy the day it came out.</p><p>this game had the familar style of panzer dragoon, but overwhelmed me with the vector sytlized graphics and deep organic electric music.. this game was a unique gaming experience that i only come close to feeling with the wipeout series.. it was magic ^_^.</p><p class='img'>16. <b>Megaman 3</b> - Capcom / NES / 1990<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/megaman3.webp" /></p><p>following Megaman 2, i caught wind that megaman 3 had just been released thanks to nintendo power. my parents actually bought it for me, even though they never buy anything.. whoo hoo.. since i actually owned the game, i played it much much more than megaman 2..</p><p class='img'>15. <b>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</b> - Sega / Genesis / 1992<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/sonic2.webp" /></p><p>back in the day.. i loved the side scrollers.. i saw the commercials for the sega genesis all the time.. and then the sega genesis included Sonic the Hedgehog.. it was at this point, i was able to convince my parents to buy me one ^_^.. although i played the first one to death, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 had all the elements of the first game with the addition of the ring world, super sonic and much more memorable music.. overall, i loved this game alot more than the first ^_^.</p><p class='img'>14. <b>GoldenEye 007</b> - Nintendo / Nintendo 64 / 1997<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/goldeneye.webp" /></p><p>I played this game all the time with my best friend.. we were absolutely equal in skill at this game, and we played for HOURS.. school would be the morning, and then we'd work at Toys R Us in the evenings.. we'd get off work at 10pm and then go back to his house, and play Goldeneye into 2 or 3am in the morning on a school night. we'd do this just about every night. it was a regular daily event..

Chrono Trigger was non-linear, featured better music (in my opinion), slightly better battle system, etc.. I had a lot more fun with Chrono Trigger than Final Fantasy VI.. for some reason.</p><p class='img'>10. <b>Gran Turismo 3</b> - Polyphony Digital / Playstation 2 / 2001<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/gt3.webp" /></p><p>back in high school, i used to play Racing quite a bit more than i do these days, and when i first saw the realistic looking graphics i couldn't wait to play it. The thing that set Gran Turismo apart from other racing games was the in-depth management of cars. all other racing games were just about the racing, and even gran turismo took that a step further with realistic play control. and took the graphics a step further as well. the first complete racing simulation.</p><p>Gran Turismo 2 took the management one step further, but the graphics weren't that much better. I played both games quite a bit, but i didn't love it quite as much as Gran Turismo 3 because at that time i had friends much more into gaming. We all got the game when it came out and played it all simultaneously. every couple of days we'd get together and race each other with our cars we've been using ^_^. no other racing game could compare to Gran Turismo 3.</p><p>unfortunately my over playing of Gran Turismo 3 tainted me for Gran Turismo 4. i was so hyped for GT4, that i bought all the GT Concepts, and GT4 Prologue, and i loved those games, but when GT4 came out, it was just GT3 all over again.. and unfortunately i was burnt out, and no friends to compete against either. sadness</p><p class='img'>9. <b>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</b> - iD software / PC / 2001<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/rtcw.webp" /></p><p>One weekend back at the beginning of college, Stu came to visit and brought a new game with him.. Wolfenstein. We installed it on my computer and didn't leave the room for 2 days after.. The multiplayer aspect was addictive and engaging, but the best part was that everybody sucked at the game. it was new and everybody who played the game was new at it.. it wasn't full of people who would kill everybody and then not get scratched. we were all on the same level, which only added to the addictivity.</p><p>after that weekend, i picked up my own copy and played constantly ^_^. i eventually joined a clan and we picked off several lesser clans.. unfortunately, i got out of the game when the summer came around and i no longer had the strong connection to the internet the school provided.. i tried playing again since then but couldn't get back into it... sigh..</p><p class='img'>8. <b>Final Fantasy VIII</b> - Squaresoft / Playstation / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ffviii.webp" /></p><p>known to many as one of the worst final fantasies. i fell in love with this game the moment i heard of it's existance. I played Final Fantasy VII quite a bit, but FFVII retained a cartoony nature that didn't set the game in reality. When i first saw screenshots of FFVIII, i was blown away. A Final Fantasy where the characters actually look like real people..</p><p>Everytime a little bit of information was released about the game, i ate it up. I imported Brave Fencer Musashiden, so that my friends and i would have the first glance at the game in action, and we were not dissapointed at all. It had a slightly more futuristic feel than FFVII, the character's had more substance.. i eventually beat the import at the Arts Institute, when i brought it in to show off.. ^_^</p><p>Overall though, the game was pretty bad. the story was absolutely terrible, and the gameplay was so radical to ever work correctly. it was the characters and the setting that won me over.. it's the idea that makes it my favorite final fantasy, and certainly not the game itself.</p><p class='img'>7. <b>Chrono Cross</b> - Squaresoft / Playstation / 2000<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/chronocross.webp" /></p><p>As a sequel to Chrono Trigger was announced, i watched the news closely to everything that was leaked little by little. and when i finally got a hold of the trailer, i was blown away by the graphics, the characters, and most of all, the music.. I imported it the day it came out, and loved it. The graphics were the best i had seen on the playstation, and the music flowed through me as i played the game. there were times, i just set down the controller and just listened.</p><p>the story was interesting, and made you think. The characters were beautifully concepted, as well as some of the enemies. this game was in it's own world, and that set it apart from Final Fantasy or any other RPG i've played before. I think Chrono Cross is the RPG that i've played through the most.. i played through the japanese version twice, and then the american version a time and a half.</p><p>It scares me to think that one day Squaresoft was will Chrono Break, and it will suck so bad that all creditibility of the Chrono series will die off.. Yoichi Wada has ruined that company enough.</p><p class='img'>6. <b>Wipeout XL</b> - Psygnosis / Playstation / 1996<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/wipeoutxl.webp" /></p><p>This was the first wipeout i played, and it blew me away.. i mean, i played Fzero before but it was nothing like this game.. Wipeout was futuristic racing in the deep dark dirty future.. The environments you faced in had the dirty industrial feel of the over industrialized future.. and had music to match. The featured music was the perfect example of the growing underground music scene. it was so wicked. It brought about such an underground feel to the game itself, especially when featured in the hit movie Hackers. ^_^</p><p class='img'>5. <b>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</b> - Nintendo / Nintendo 64 / 1998<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda5.webp" /></p><p>The 3D make-up of my favorite 2D game at the time, did not dissapoint me. ^_^</p><p class='img'>4. <b>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</b> - Nintendo / Super Nintendo / 1992<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/zelda3.webp" /></p><p>I played alot of side scrollers, and other action type games earlier on in my life, Zelda was one of my first experiences with an overhead type adventure, which i thought was much more expansive than your typical side scroller, and on top of that wasn't as 'kiddy' as super mario, it was a true hero's adventure.</p><p>this was also the first Zelda i played as well, i went back and tried to play the original and zelda II, but they couldn't compare against the 16bit juggernaut which had more options, side-quests, story elements, and better graphics.</p><p>overall, i think Zelda Minish Cap is a better game, for the same reasons i think Zelda 3 is better than Zelda 1, however playing through Minish Cap was really just an updated version of the original sprite based adventure. You can change the story all you want, the best part of Zelda is the true quest of the Master Sword v. Ganon.</p><p class='img'>3. <b>Tetris</b> - Nintendo / Gameboy / 1989<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/tetris.webp" /></p><p>There's no other game that i have as much respect for than Tetris. Tetris is the chess of the video gaming world. (well.. probably more like checkers, really). It has been around since the mid eighties, and these days is still one of the biggest tests of gaming ability.</p><p>Back in the day, i used to play the gameboy version all the time (much like all these games, really).. i'd take it somewhere and play. sometimes another kid would have one with and i would battle against him ^_^, usually winning.</p><p>These days, i still play Tetris the Grand master on MAME, but i'm not as great as the greatest players in the world.. maybe i should work on that ^_^. They need to release a GOOD recent console version of one of the arcade games. Tetris the Grand Master on PS2. c'mon, port it already!!</p><p class='img'>2. <b>Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Import</b> - Konami / Playstation 2 / 2003<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/ddrextreme.webp" /></p><p>Dance Dance Revolution is one my favorite games, and my favorite DDR game has got to be DDR Extreme Japan.. no other home version has this many songs crossing this many genres.. there is something for everyone. i've made friends playing this games, and have had some of my favorite times in college playing this game with these friends ^_^. ontop of that, there has been no other game that has come close to the amount of time i've spent on this game.. i've played it for almost two years straight.. lost weight, toned leg muscles.. and i still play it today every now and then when i get bored of ITG.. no other game has changed my life, the way this one has.</p><p class='img'>1. <b>Snatcher</b> - Konami / Sega CD / 1994<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/top20/snatcher.webp" /></p><p>When i first played this game, i was blown away.. there was nothing else like it that i had experienced.. the story was the most unique take on andriods possing as people, much like terminator..

| May 19, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><div class='title'><b>Intro / History</b></div><p>for those who don't know, Magic Knight Rayearth is an action rpg based off the popular anime series by Clamp. early in the year 1998, the saturn unleased its last batch of games: Panzer Dragoon Saga, Burning Rangers, Shining Force III, and House of the Dead.. i was working at Toys R us at the time, we got only 4 copies of each game, and after that we never got anymore saturn games at all. The saturn had died..</p><p>but towards the end of the year, after Xenosaga and Metal Gear Solid came out for the playstation, speciality gaming store like Electronic Boutique and Funcoland (at the time) received very few copies of Magic Knight Rayearth as a new release, after the saturn's death. i think i remember a few people talking about some game that came out for the saturn at EB, but Toys R us never got a copy for me to take a look at.</p><p>skip ahead 6 years to last christmas break. i found a pretty good deal on ebay for Magic Knight Rayearth, so i picked it up. Then I learned that my saturn was missing it's a/v cable, and i also lost all my saturn controllers as well.. so over the course of the previous semester i had been putting it back together, so to speak. i got a saturn controller from eau claire during no brand con, and then a found a saturn a/v cable online when surfing around.</p><p>with my saturn complete, i arrived home last week, and started to play.</p><div class='title'><b>Impressions...</b></div><p>like most Working Designs game, it's chalk full of voice acting, and anime cutscenes. It took about an hour into the game, until i was actually able to walk around and do some fighting. overall, the game is quite dissapointing.. i suppose that's why i never really heard anything about it after it first came out.</p><p>The game plays just like the old 16-bit Zelda. You have your overhead view of your characters, and then you slash at enemies to kill them. You have 3 characters that you can switch back and forth to and from at will.</p><p>There's Hikaru whose magic element is fire. even though she's kind of the leader, i think she's the weakest one of them all. her slash is generally the same as Link's slash. very close range, i usually get hit by whomever i'm trying to kill before i land an attack.</p><p>Next, there's Umi whose magic element its water/ice. She's the smart one of the group, and her attacks are more useful than hikarus. She also has a sword, but she's a fencer so she attacks forward with more range, plus she takes off more damage than hikaru.</p><p>Finally, there's Fuu. She's the calm collective bitch of the group. Her element is Wind and Healing. Her weapon is a bow and arrow, so she's best with range attacks, although they are quite weak. Her powered up shot, sends 3 homing arrows off to kill enemies. She's the most useful of the group.</p><p>After playing this game a little more and a little more, i realize just how bad it is.. I think A Link to the Past had better, more realistic sounding sound-effects than this game. Plus, when there are more than 15 or 16 sprites on the screen at once, the saturn lags. thats terrible. especially when there's a version of this game on the super nintendo that probably runs seemless.</p><p>plus i get so bored, running around doing meanille tasks, that i just can't play it for hours on end. i usually switch to tv, or go outside for a little while before coming back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So.. Overall, Magic Knight Rayearth isn't all that great. I have no idea why it is so rare, but i'm glad i didn't pay the $120 most people ask for it online. if you are a die hand Magic Knight or CLAMP fan that most see everything there is, then i suggest you rent it.. (and by rent it, i mean check out the snes rom)</p><p>Next...</p><p>i may have my saturn working, but it still doesn't save games. once i fix the memory problem, i'll start playing Panzer Dragoon Saga again, unless i get suckered into buying/playing Eternal Mana or Stella Dues.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Anime Video Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/anime-video-games">Anime Video Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 28, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><div class='title'><b><u>Sword of Berserk</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>Sword of Berserk was actually my first exposure to Berserk. i remember hearing about how violent the game was, so i picked it up one day at work to check it out. (at the time i worked the video game section at toys r us). i brought at home and was stunned at the amount of blood in the game. everytime you hit an enemy they would erupt in blood. i went through, but never could beat the game.. griffith always kicked my ass. after a while i pawned it off to my little brother for safe keeping, and in turn, he went out and sold it with a bunch of my other games.</p><p>3 years later, i was introduced to the Anime series at spamm. i was quite impressed. berserk has such a raw approach to its characters and events, surrounded by compelling characters. it would have been perfect, if not for the ending, to which i am saddened. berserk is one of those series that the anime caught up to the manga, so they just stopped the anime, RIGHT during the climax of the story. ugh.</p><p>After which, KJ kept telling me how great the manga is, so i bought the first few books. ugh, i didn't like it. it had the raw violence, but the drawings were kinda funny and there wasn't any story yet. the first two books were basically part of the 1st episode of the anime. it was just violence without an introduction to the characters.</p><p>a couple weeks ago, KJ got me the scanlations for berserk and said i should try reading it again. once i got past that first story arc, i was hooked. this was the berserk i remember, and not only that, there was more detail in the situations and story. and after the first couple of books, the drawings actually got good too. they were more fluid and less stoic. i finished the 28 books in about the span of a week. i was hooked ^_^.</p><p>after reading the manga, i wanted to know how the berserk game fit into everything. so off i quested for the game, and found it relatively easy...</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>good lord, this game really isn't good. someone who didn't know anything about Berserk would be dissapointed because the story is closely tied to the manga, and it doesn't explain who the hell anyone is. a fan of berserk would be dissapointed because the story is pure crap anyways. the story is that guts and caska stumble onto a town infested by mandragora, which are evil monsters mixed with mandrake roots. guts come in and saves the day, while meeting two other characters.</p><p>now, the berserk magna does have some side stories that last quite a while, namely the Jill arc. What is missing from Sword of Berserk is emotion. None of these news characters experience any emotional conflict. Stuff basically just happens, and then you, as Guts, go kill it.</p><p>the graphics aren't that good either. although the enviroments and character are well textured and detailed, the facial animations of Guts are hideous. I feel embarrased just watching it.</p><p>the gameplay is insanely repetitive and occasionally annoying. all i ever did in the game was hit the B button. swing, swing, swing. swing, swing, swing. the only time the game got interesting was the battle against Zodd. You actually had to dodge attacks, and come up with a strategy to defeat him. Zodd was tough, but the rest of the game was cake after that.</p><p>I suppose the one part of the game that didn't suck was the music.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>anyways, Sword of Berserk is quite terrible. I wouldn't recommend it, but if someone would have told me all this before i played the game again and after i just read the manga, I wouldn't have listened. I think thats how anime videogames work.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Record of Lodoss War</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>introduction</b></div><p>since i found one anime game on the dreamcast, i figured i should find the other one people talk about.</p><p>Record of Lodoss War is one of my favorite Animes. One of few fantasy anime that is actually good. ya know, fantasy anime is alot like movies about african-american culture. the serious ones are really really good because they focus on the most compelling points of the genre, like malcom x, etc, and lodoss war, berserk. however, when they start doing comedies, you get a bunch of crappy series/movies which are really all the same. like Barber shop, etc, and like slayers, rune soldier, etc. there aren't any movies/series that fall in between that gap.</p><p>anyways..</p><div class='title'><b>the game</b></div><p>record of lodoss war isn't really all that bad, it's just not good.</p><p>first off, the game is complete ripoff of Diablo. down to all the gameplay details. well, when your anime series is based off highly popularized american rpg, why not do the same for the game?</p><p>second off, the game really isn't all that fun. All you do is walk around, kill stuff, find treasure, kill more stuff, gain levels, and kill bosses. The game does have a little bit of story, but it's "i must prevent kardis' ressurection". the exact same story of both the anime series, and maybe even legend of crystania. The story of the game takes place around episode 10-ish of the OAV series and acts as an alternate ending.</p><p>you do get to meet up with character from the original anime series, however. you get to team up with Parn, Deedlit, Slayn, Lelyia, Pirotess, and Ashram, and as well as fight Wagnard, and be guided by Wart. kinda neat. however Ashram is incredibly weak. I can't believe the author would drag this character through the mud. First, in legend of crystania he's so weak that he was taken over by the spirit of beld. and Now he's so weak he does almost no damage against enemies i can kill in one hit?! whats up, man?</p><p>SPOILERS: speaking of weird story choices, you later find out that your main character is actually the reincarnation of emperor beld. beld really doesn't want to stay dead does he? he comes back in legend of crystania, too. wtf? I mean, he was killed by lightning in the anime. I don't think god wants you alive.</p><p>anyways, the music is annoying and the graphics are basically playstation quality.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion?</b></div><p>as stated earlier, it's not all bad, but it's certainly not good. I don't really see how this game is actually fun. The story doesn't do anything for the game, and even the anime appeal doesn't do anything either. but i keep playing it.</p><div class='title'><b>conclusion</b></div><p>well, this is basically what i did over spring break ^_^. does anyone else have any reviews of other Anime Videogames or these games? I also bought the Ghost in the Shell game for the playstation which i have yet to get around to playing.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dance Dance Revolutions Max 2 Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ddr-max-2-impressions">Dance Dance Revolutions Max 2 Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 26, 2003 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>I got my shiny copy of DDRMax 2 early Friday afternoon, just before I was about to leave for class on time. I signed for the package, tore into the package, looked at the beautiful box, but then left to catch my class. When I got back home later, I tore into the game. ^_^</p><p>It seems that the cycle of odd sequels continues to be true! 3rd: Good! 4th: Bad. 5th: Good! 6th: Bad. 7th: Good! After playing around for the past year in arcades and other home versions, it seems that each time they wrong themselves, they find a way to make it right. Like the wrongs made in 4th Mix were corrected in Extra Mix. The wrongs made in 6th Mix were corrected in the US release of 6th Mix, DDRMax. This whole theory seems to mostly apply to the home versions, though, as 4th Mix Arcade is really good. Well, 6th Mix Arcade kinda sucks. But 8th Mix is damn impressive.</p><p>Anyway, 7th Mix holds its own as a fine Japanese compliment to the US release of DDRMax. 7th Mix goes a tiny step further with 3 more total songs. (74 songs compared to US Max's 71.) There are very few songs that appear in both Max2 JP and Max US. Only 10 or so. </p><p>The real step forward is the multitude of Oni courses in Max2, not just the amount, but the difficulty as well. I'm able to beat some Oni courses with some of the beginning courses being mostly standard difficulty, and only 5 songs. There's a total of 21 Oni courses, and 3 of them are "endless." Speaking of which, Endless Mode is back in DDR again (somewhere), which hasn't been in a home version since Extra Mix.</p><p>I made a page with the complete song list and the complete Oni course list: <a href="/pages/ddrmax2.html" title="/pages/ddrmax2.html" title="/pages/ddrmax2.html">here</a></p><p>DDRMax2 is set to come over here in America (land of the free) in November. I wonder how extensive the changes will be with a package this great. A couple songs will disappear due to legal reasons, as always, but hey, we might gain some as well. Hopefully something better than Sandstorm by Darude this time, ugh.</p><p>Be sure to stop by McGregor Hall for DDR Sunday Nights because this is what we'll be playing for the remainder of the semester.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/11">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/9">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
