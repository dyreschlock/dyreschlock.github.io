Horizon is set in the distant future after our society had somehow been wiped out. Humanity has emerged again and currently live in hunter/gatherer tribes sprinkled across the world. The world is now shared with massive robotic beings emulating the animals of the past.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503162133_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When Horizon was first shown in 2015, it looked amazing, unique, and fresh. However, the series has been plagued by bad release dates. Zero Dawn released on Feb 28th, 2017, ONE WEEK before the Switch's release and Zelda Breath of the Wild. People only came to Zero Dawn later. And now with Horizon Forbidden West, it released on Feb 18th, 2022, ONE WEEK before Elden Ring, another massive release that completely overshadowed Horizon.</p><p>Despite bad releases, Horizon is a tent-pole series for Sony and Playstation, and even recently they've released a Lego game about Horizon. People may not have played the games at launch, but they've definitely gone back to them, and ultimately loved what they played.</p><p>I'm one of those people as well. After the DLC released for Zero Dawn in late 2017, I <a href="/old/v7/horizon-zero-dawn" title="/horizon-zero-dawn">played through it</a>, and ultimately really liked the experience. And now, having played through Forbidden West, this series really deserves its place among the greats. It's a shame how much it is overlooked for one reason or another.</p><p>I think the most intriguing thing about Zero Dawn was the overall story and mystery of what happened to humanity. This was my biggest draw. What event caused our society to fail, how did these humans survive it, yet not know anything about it? And how did this robotic presence come to be? Zero Dawn answers all these questions through the eyes of our protagonist, Aloy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429135821_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Story of Horizon Zero Dawn</b></div><p>Aloy was born an outcast, motherless. She was found in a mountain by another outcast named Rost, and raised as his own daughter. Without a true family, she was never accepted in her tribe as a full member. As a child, while exploring mountains she fell into a cave and found a device called a focus. A focus is a metallic ear piece of the old humans. It's basically Google Glass, that allows you to scan things and show information about them. No one else really seemed to understand how to use it, but Aloy could figure it out immediately.</p><p>While playing Aloy as a child, you are introduced to the idea of the machine animals. Apparently, they were all peaceful and they lived together in harmony with the tribal humans. But recently, some of the animals have become aggressive and occassionally attack humans for unknown reasons.</p><p>As a teenager, Aloy joins the rite of passage of her tribe to become a full member. If she passes the test, it wouldn't matter whether or not she was motherless. She was able to pass the rite and become accepted in the tribe, but the tribe was attacked by a fanatical group who also had focuses. Now that she was a member of the Nora tribe, she was tasked to venture west and learn more about this group, and for her, why they had focuses,  how they figured out to use them, and why the machines have become more aggressive.</p><p>This was the introductory part of Zero Dawn. From here, the map and the game opened up allowing you to explore the remains of the central United States. Much of the game's story was navigating the politics between the various tribes and solving their problems. This was the absolute most boring part of the game. Who cares about these primitive tribes... I want to know about what happened to the world.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502212938_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Eventually Aloy stumbles into one of the factories underneath the surface of the Earth, still operational and producing the machine animals. These factories are known as cauldrons. Text and audio messages of the old humans point her towards the ancient ruins of the Faro Company. Here, she learns that we're now in the 31st century. </p><p>Only 1000 years had passed since the "extinction" of humanity. That seemed like a short time for life to evolve to the point of humantiy having tribal societies. Humans of the 21st were wiped out by the Faro Plague. The Faro Company had developed "peace-keeping" military robots that self-replicated and lived off of biomass. Smart. Let's make robots use living things as fuel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503065525_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Aloy also meets Sylens, the eventual antagonist. He is presented as a tinkerer and scholar trying to understand the old humans and how they built and developed all the massive buildings and technology of the past. He also wonders why the peaceful machines have become more aggressive. In recent years, not only have they become more aggressive, but many new machines have advanced weaponry and are built like war machines.</p><p>He and Aloy share information and work together to find out more. Aloy is eventually led to the main lab of Zero Dawn, and she finds herself, Elizabet Sobeck. Elizabet Sobeck was an old world scientist who led the project of Zero Dawn, a scientific project designed to terraform and repopulate the Earth after the Faro Plague. The core of Zero Dawn was an AI system known as GAIA, which operated with nine subbordinate functions, each having their own role in terraformation. </p><p>One of the subfunctions is APOLLO. After the other subfunctions birthed plantlife, reenergized and fueled oceans and rivers, and reintroduced animal and human life, APOLLO was meant to educate the new humans with all the knowledge of its databases, the sum of all knowledge and intelligence of humanity. This was meant to bring humanity back to its current state. It was deleted, sabotaged by Ted Faro, the same man who created the machines which killed all life. His idea was that humanity led itself to the point of destruction, so new life should follow its own path.</p><p>Another subfunction of GAIA was HADES. HADES' responsbility of terraformation is a reset. If the terraformation process had continued to a point where it's determined that humanity could not exist and thrive, HADES would be activated and begin destroying all life on Earth again, so GAIA could begin a new cycle and try again.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250503070052_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Aloy learns that 18 years ago, HADES was activated. This was the same day that Aloy was born, or found. Using the stored DNA of prominent humans, GAIA's subfunction responsible for creating life, birthed Aloy, a genetic clone of Elizabet Sobeck. Aloy learns that this was a defense of GAIA. HADES' first plan of attack would be to take over GAIA and immediately destroy all life. But GAIA deleted herself in defense, and birthed Aloy as her last action.</p><p>Aloy's sole purpose in life was to destroy HADES, restore GAIA, and allow GAIA to bring balance back to the world's ecosystems.</p><p>Without GAIA, its subfunctions scattered themselves through the cauldron network on Earth. The subfunction responsible for creating the terraforming machine animals began to create aggressive and warlike machines to protect itself from any human threat. Without GAIA, HADES had to come up with other methods for the world to destroy itself, including showing itself to a particular tribe which began worshipping it as a god. This tribe then attacked Aloy's tribe at the beginning in order to kill her and prevent her from saving the world.</p><p>Aloy also learns that Sylens was the founder of this tribe as HADES promised him all the secrets of the old world for his successes. The tribe's ultimate purpose was to connect HADES to GAIA's communication subfunction, MINERVA, allowing it to reactivate the Faro robots and destroy all life again. Sylens helps Aloy infiltrate the tribe and defeat them, but not before HADES had connected to a signalling tower.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While the overall mystery is the most interesting part of the game for me, much of the game is spent helping the tribes of central US with their political problems and such. Throughout the game, you make a lot of friends and help a lot of people. So much so that by the end of the game, you are able to bring everyone together to fight and defeat HADES at the MINERVA Spire.</p><p>With HADES defeated, it was able to run a final escape routine and its essence escapes, only to be captured in a mechanical lantern held by Sylens, determined to tortune it for its secrets.</p><p>The game abruptly ends, but the DLC continues with a few more details. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250505150548_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the DLC, Aloy travels north to a frozen area controlled by a single tribe. You later find out this is Yellowstone Park. You eventually find a separate subbordinate function of GAIA known as CYAN. CYAN's only purpose was to prevent the Yellowstone Caldera from erupting. Through helping the tribe and CYAN, you learn about HEPHAESTUS.</p><p>HEPHAESTUS is one of GAIA's main subfunctions and it is responsible for creating the animal-like machines that help terraform Earth. When GAIA purged itself, its subbordinate functions were no longer controlled by her. They were able to assert their independence. So, in an effort to keep its independence, HEPHAESTUS started creating machines to kill humans since they were the only ones who could restore GAIA.</p><p>In the end, when you save CYAN from HEPHAESTUS' grip, HEPHAESTUS disappears in the cauldron network. Unlike the other core subfunctions of GAIA, HEPHAESTUS is able to move its presence around the globe, making it nearly impossible to find and subdue.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506073515_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But, this is where the story of Zero Dawn concludes. It leads to a climactic battle with HADES in the end, but after the battle, the game ends. Sylens steals HADES and walks off, and you're left with credits. The doomsday signal was prevented, but there really isn't much closure.</p><p>I mean, I guess you learned everything there was to know about the mystery of life and extinction of Earth. You followed Aloy throughout her entire life from birth and childhood to adult, overcoming her isolation and discovering her true origin. There is closure to that story, as a cutscene plays when Aloy finds Elizabet Sobeck's home from a thousand years ago, and discovers the ancient remnants of her decaying bones. It is a touching moment.</p><p>So, while the ending felt unsatisfying because of Sylen's cliffhanger, the overall journey was really good. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506111700_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was definitely a great experience undercut by The Legend of Zelda taking all the spotlight. Both games are very similar, too, which lends to a lot of unfortunate comparisons. </p><p>Breath of the Wild is an amazing innovative open world experience. You can climb everything and naturally discover everything in the environment throughout your journey. Horizon is also open world, but you cannot climb everything, you don't have a glider to smoothly go down mountains, and interesting places on the map are automatically revealed to you through completing "towers" in the form of the Tailnecks. Horizon is very much an iteration of open world design compared to Breath of the Wild's innovation.</p><p>But again, I think the overall story of the world elevates it above other open world games. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250426192843_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Horizon Forbidden West</b></div><p>So far, this post has focused on Horizon Zero Dawn, not Forbidden West. It may seem unnecessary but all this background story information is incredibly important as it's the entire purpose of the world and of Aloy's character. It's all stuff that I had totally forgotten in the 7 years since playing it, and when beginning Forbidden West, there's a 5-10 minute recap video that doesn't really explain all these details well.</p><p>Horizon Forbidden West picks up a few months after the ending events of Zero Dawn with the story assuming you keenly remember all the details of Zero Dawn fresh in your mind. Hostile machines are still appearing because of HEPHAESTUS and Aloy searches old ruin after old ruin looking for a backup of GAIA to restore her and make the planet whole.</p><p>Every backup of GAIA she finds ends up being a trap set up by Elizabet Sobeck back in the day to prevent it falling into the wrong hands. Frustrated, Aloy reunites with her friends from the first game as they talk about the blight. In addition to the machines becoming more aggressive, plant life has now begun to decay. A red scurge has begun to grow from the ground that chokes out life around it. The tribes of the midwest hope to contact tribes in the west to find a solution, and Aloy agrees to go west as she found a hint that more GAIA backups are there, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427173759_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I never noticed this in the first game, so maybe it was never really there, but Aloy doesn't really seem to pay attention when she's talking with people. Obviously she has an isolated personality from spending the first 18 years of her life as an outcast having no true family. She made plenty of friends and allies throughout the course of Zero Dawn, but when talking with these allies now in Forbidden West, she's asking them questions directly and never really joining in the conversation.</p><p>For me, being over 7 years after playing the first game, I don't remember any of them, and I didn't really care about their story at the time either. When they talk, I'm skipping through the dialogue just to continue the story. I don't really care about the details of their life, and what they've been doing since the final battle against HADES. And seemingly, Aloy doesn't seem to care, either.</p><p>The dialogue options also seem to push this narrative, since her questions ask about the details of the person, the family, or the tribe. She never asks about them personally, their feelings, or their ideas. She doesn't say anything specific to react. She presents a "face" that only seems to care about the "mission" she has in front of her. Throughout the events of Zero Dawn, she changed so many lives for the better by saving families and helping nearly everyone with their problems both big and small. Sure, Aloy cares about the good she did, but does she really care about the people themselves?</p><p>I never noticed any of this until one character at the beginning pointed it out to Aloy. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250427072025_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Erand was a key character in the first game who helped Aloy track down the fanatical tribe and fought with her in the end. Aloy changed his life by finding his sister's murderer, and giving him peace from his frustrated and closed off life. Also, perhaps giving him someone to care about in the process.</p><p>He lambasts Aloy for leaving at the end of the final battle without saying a word. After HADES was defeated, Aloy immediately left to continue her quest to find GAIA at the expense of all the friendships she had formed.</p><p>Her mission is obviously of the highest importance. Life on Earth still seems to decay and restoring GAIA is the only way to bring balance back. But, she is also a savior to the midwest tribal society and she has meaning and warmth to everyone she has helped. This is also part of life on Earth.</p><p>It may sound somewhat selfish of him to ask, "What about me?" But when the savior, and also you as the player, skip through all the dialogue, only ask questions about specific details of the person's problems, and only agree to help because it's a question mark on the map, despite all the good you do, is there still value in doing something to change another person's life if you don't care?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250506213531_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After Erand mentions this, I notice that Aloy rarely ever keeps eye contact with the people she's talking with. She often looks away, and returns her gaze saying something generic to conclude the conversation. You might think this is some kind of bug, making the characters look more like puppets, but all the other characters (minor or major) keep their eye contact with Aloy when talking. They look at her when talking, and even show emotion when talking about something important to them.</p><p>The acting and dialogue is sometimes a little weird. They use a lot of modern common phrases and ideas, even though they're meant to be a primitive tribal society. Each dialogue sequence feels like it was filmed in The Mandalorian's green screen sphere. But the actors show emotion and keep eye contact. They are truly grateful for the deeds of Aloy.</p><p>Aloy doesn't care, or doesn't know how to show she cares. She's mostly just checking boxes off of the quest log. Same as me.</p><p>You could really blow this out further and extend it to all role playing adjacent games. Do we really care about all the people we're helping in these games?</p><p>Well, just like the first game, I did not care about the politics of the tribal societies. I was just pushing forward because the game is super fun to play. BUT! This all changed when Forbidden West had its Planet of the Apes 2 (Beneath the Planet of the Apes) moment. Future Humans exist!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152218_t.webp" /></a></p><p>How?!  A new mystery!</p><p>All life had been wiped out on Earth, and if anyone had survived, they wouldn't have waited 1000 years to finally emerge. In Zero Dawn, you learned of an ark which was meant to shelter human and animal genomes was being sent to the Sirius star system. This project was known as Far Zenith and the ark was called the Odyssey. The project was a failure, though, as it had malfunctioned and exploded in orbit. Well, apparently, this was false. A ruse to mask their success.</p><p>Moreover, the future humans (whom we call Zeniths after the Far Zenith mission) have their own clone of Elizabet Sobeck, the same age as Aloy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250428152204_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This happens at the HADES testing facility after catching up with Sylens and destroying HADES for good. Deep within the facility, Aloy finally finds a working backup copy of GAIA still intact. She gains the GAIA backup, but her exit is interrupted by the Zenith's entrance. As Aloy hides, the Sobeck clone acquires the other remaining backup. With both backups removed, Aloy's hiding spot is exposed and you lock eyes with the clone for a moment, both somewhat reveling in the discovery of another you.</p><p>The moment is broken as the Zeniths grab the other Sobeck. They identify Aloy as a redundant clone, and one Zenith stays behind to eliminate you. The Zeniths have a perfect shield, preventing any damage, and you barely escape the facility. </p><p>Escaping danger and with one of the GAIA backups, Aloy moves west following a subfunction signal. After infiltrating the facility, you're able to reintegrate MINERVA into GAIA, and restore GAIA's consciousness. With a restored GAIA, you ask about the Zeniths, your clone, and how to proceed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429131620_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Far Zenith mission was originally intended to seed life on a world in the Sirius system, 8.6 light years away. This would be done using the Odyssey spacecraft, an ark with all the instructions for life on Earth. It could be operated by a crew of 60 people. The rich and powerful elite of the 21st century then falsified its destruction and piloted the ship themselves to Sirius. Through technological advancements, they developed some kind of technology or therapy that allowed them to extend their lives indefinitely. We are not given any more information about that throughout the rest of the game.</p><p>The Zeniths made it to the Sirius system and set up a colony on one of its planets. However, a geological event occurred which destroyed the planet and forced them to return to Earth. As such, they were the ones who sent the signal to GAIA and HADES to re-terraform the planet in preparation of their arrival, and they created a clone of Elizabet Sobeck to restore GAIA to its full function.</p><p>They are responsible for HADES in the first game, and ultimately, they are the catalyst for GAIA giving birth to Aloy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250502230032_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You also learn the despite defeating HADES and now restoring GAIA, life on Earth is still on the course of extinction because of the growing damage to the biosphere. You only have 4 months to completely restore all of GAIA's subfunctions or else the damage cannot be reversed.</p><p>GAIA has nine total subfunctions. HADES has been destroyed. APOLLO was sabotaged and destroyed by Ted Faro one thousand years ago. And, you have restored MINERVA. This leaves six more subfunctions. HEPHAESTUS is one of the most important subfunctions as it controls the creation of the machine animals. With its control, robots can be made to repair Earth rather than attack humans. We encountered HEPHAESTUS before at Yellowstone park, and its now constantly moving through Earth's cauldron network impossible to contain.</p><p>GAIA is able to locate three of the other five subfunctions, but the other two are completely silent. AETHER, DEMETER, and POSEIDON are not that far away, and by restoring these three, GAIA would have enough "computing power" to be able to contain HEPHAESTUS if plugged into the network, and this would be enough to stabilize and rejuvenate Earth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250429143403_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, after 20 hours into Forbidden West, the map is completely open and our path to the end is defined. It's no longer just chasing lead after lead in a linear fashion, much like the first game. </p><p>Also, GAIA's current location becomes our base of operations. Some of the main characters we've met so far move into the base, and are given focuses to understand the futuristic technology and the current threat to life on Earth. There are some friends from the first game, but many of the new characters are also misfits and outcasts who don't fit into their tribes.</p><p>The structure of the game from here to the end really feels like Mass Effect. You aren't running around with a party like Mass Effect, but occasionally some of your friends will come with you on a mission. Back at the base, you can also talk with everyone about their thoughts on the current story, current missions, other characters, and about Earth. You get a much more complete sense of all the characters' personalities.</p><p>Moreover, as you meet more characters and bring them to your base, it feels like you're actually building something together. You're building a fellowship and a home. You occassionally have character missions which result in meaningful changes, like solving the blight and healing those lands, which in turn, results in changes to the characters. And while Aloy still asks simple direct questions, that feeling of isolation begins to go away as she becomes part of a family. Aloy shows more emotion when talking to her friends, and engages in actual conversation with them, even though sometimes it feels awkward.</p><p>Although, the true catalyst for this change is the other clone of Elizabet Sobeck, whom Aloy eventually identifies as her sister.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195259_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After restoring one of the three subfunctions, Aloy receives a distress signal from the location of a subfunction you couldn't find before. You have no idea what this could be. Is it actually that subfunction? Or is it a trap from the Zeniths? Either way, Aloy investigates. One Zenith is at the location, but is killed by a weapon developed by Sylens.</p><p>After killing everyone left, you descend into the facility and find the source of the signal in a stack of containment pods. It's the clone, alive, but unconscious. You bring her back to base, and you're able to talk to her after she wakes up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504195507_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The original purpose of the Far Zenith mission was to seed life on a distant world, so their ark, the Odyssey, housed DNA of all species on Earth. For humanity, it had samples from 200,000 individuals, including Elizabet Sobeck. The Zeniths used this DNA to create a clone, who they diminutively named Beta.</p><p>Beta was raised in near complete isolation. The other Zeniths never spoke with her, except giving her direct, cold instructions. On the Odyssey was a full copy of APOLLO, so Beta spent all day learning from it and studying it. There was one Zenith who sometimes reached out to Beta in private, but eventually that contact was completely cut. </p><p>Beta grow up never having anyone and never understanding warmth. A life very similar to Aloy's. Except Aloy did have a warming voice, her adoptive father from the first game, Rost. As another outcast, he never really gave Aloy love, but he still pointed her in the right direction, and died giving his life for her. This allowed her to keep moving forward, fighting the odds and overcoming difficulties. Beta was never given any opportunity for love or growth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511114052_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's an interesting, yet perverse idea to think about how the path of your life would change given a different environment, different people, and different situations. Without given any opportunity for growth or challenges to overcome, what kind of person would <u>you</u> be? Or with given incredible challenges and difficulties, would you be able to overcome them? And then, what kind of person would you be?</p><p>So scared of the thought of failure, Beta is shocked and terrified at your progress of restoring GAIA. The Zeniths have a total of three subfunctions for their copy of GAIA, and you only have two now. She escaped thinking you'd easily be able to defeat the Zenith and she'd be safe. But, she panics at the uncertainly accepting it as failure. You try to help and reassure her, but it only causes more unease.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250504202019_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Your friends at the base eventually calm her down later, but you find her pessimism frustrating and defeating. Honestly, I think Aloy is doing pretty good with just a bow and arrow so far.</p><p>Anyways, Aloy runs off to get the other two subfunctions and with each one retrieved, GAIA can stabilize more parts of the biosphere, and extinction is pushed off by a couple more months at a time. With the extra three subfunctions retrieved, Aloy and friends come up with a plan to capture HEPHAESTUS and integrate it into GAIA. While still pretty sure of their failure, Beta agrees to help with the condition that Aloy kills her if things go bad.</p><p>Well, things good bad. They successfully capture and integrate HEPHAESTUS into GAIA, but the Zeniths arrive. They steal GAIA and recapture Beta. Aloy cannot follow through with Beta's wish for death. A Zenith stays behind, kills one of your party members, and you are knocked unconscious.</p><p>Later, you awake in a bunker, unharmed and free to roam. You meet one of the Zeniths as you emerge from the bunker in her home from 1000 years ago. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154656_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is Tilda. And she tells you about the past of the future humans.</p><p>The Zeniths successfully arrived on a planet in the Sirius system 300 years after their launch from Earth. They established a colony, but then indulged themselves in virtual reality. With their bodies becoming immortal, they could stay in virtual reality indefinitely, not noticing the planet's slow deterieration. With the planet's demise imminent, only 13 of them could escape on the Odyssey. Their plan was to return to Earth as it was the only other habitatible planet they knew about. </p><p>There are still questions, though.. Why signal HADES to kill all life on Earth and reset the biosphere? Why not try to live with or understand current life on Earth before destroying it indiscriminately? Tilda says its because they're all evil and narcisistic. This is true, but this is more cartoony evil rather than intelligent evil. Beings of a 1000 years wouldn't be so stupid to simply rush into this situation.</p><p>Also, why is Aloy alive? Why did Tilda save her?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511154914_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tilda knew Elizabet Sobeck. They were briefly in a relationship with each other, but the relationship was one-sided. One day, Elizabet slowed and eventually stopped contact with Tilda, and Tilda was left never really knowing why. She thought of Elizabet as an amazing impressive person, and they had great times together, but it ended.</p><p>With Beta, Tilda's feelings was complicated. She had the opportunity to raise a new copy of the woman of her desires. But she could only ever talk to her in secret and it could never equal. Beta grew weak and meek. To Tilda, Beta was a failure. This wasn't Elizabet. This wasn't even a fraction of Elizabet.</p><p>But on seeing Aloy for the first time, and studying her actions, she became infatuated.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250511160327_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Given a different environment, different situations, and a different life, what kind of person would you become and what things could you achieve?</p><p>Aloy is pretty close to a super hero in the world of Horizon. She has overcome every challenge against her, saved entire tribes, and changed countless lives. She's strong, attractive, and younger than Elizabet was when Tilda met her. If you were hung up on your ex for 1000 years, and you saw how a different version of them became the savior of humanity again, how could you not become obsessed and enamored with them?</p><p>Tilda says that she'll betray the other Zeniths for you and help you rescue both Beta and GAIA.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517163117_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, the final assault is set. Tilda sneaks your party into the Zenith base. Sylens uses his weapon to disable the Zenith's shields. Beta releases HEPHAESTUS from capture allowing her to create machines to fight the Zenith's hordes of robots. Most Zeniths are killed in battle, and you have a final showdown with the Zenith who killed your friend.</p><p>Aloy makes it to the command center of the Zenith base, following the leader. She rescues Beta from her virtual reality prison. The leader of the Zenith emerges, but he's killed by Tilda. And you learn of the truth.</p><p>The Zeniths were never planning on staying on Earth. They only arrived on Earth to retrieve GAIA, resupply, and escape in some random direction to find a new home. They needed GAIA so they could terraform whatever planet they found. And with all the data of APOLLO and the collection of DNA, they could create their new world.</p><p>They were running away because an entity was chasing them. Sirius wasn't destroyed because of a geological event or a super-nova or whatever. </p><p>It was destroyed by Nemesis.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171128_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Some of the future humans, perhaps the ones who developed whatever methods that resulted in their immortality, weren't content with their organic bodies. They thought that the true next evolution of humanity would downloading their consciousness into a digital form. A digital transcendence.</p><p>Some humans completed this procedure and began life in their test environment. But, the project and experiment was ultimately abandoned, as many others were content with their virtual relaity lives. The human consciousnesses were left in isolation within the containment. Left to fester over centuries. Their hatred grew against their former colleagues and all of their sentience was replaced with this hatred.</p><p>20 years ago, this sentience figured out how to break containment and it escaped into the Zenith's virtual reality network. It began killing every Zenith. Only 13 of them were able to escape using the Odyssey. Knowing the Earth was the only place they could go, Nemesis sent the extinction signal to Earth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517171130_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the other Zeniths dead, Tilda asks you to come with her on the rocket and escape the Nemesis threat, but her manipulation is over. Well, if you won't go willingly, she'll just kidnap you, and she becomes the final boss. She doesn't need Beta to activate GAIA if she has you. After over 100 hours of side quests, grinding machine parts to upgrade weapons, and becoming incredibly adept at taking down high-level machines, Aloy easily defeats her, and kills her in the process.</p><p>All the Zeniths are dead. You've reacquired GAIA with many of her subfunctions. And, you've met the ultimate final boss of the next game. </p><p>It was pretty clever of the writers to have HEPHAESTUS be released because now we can still have aggressive machine animals in the next game to fight as Aloy brings together the tribal societies of Earth, educates them of the past and its technology, and somehow prepares everyone for the incoming threat of Nemesis, an entity that even the future humans couldn't defeat.</p><p>Although, to be fair, the future humans, Zeniths, weren't prepared to fight Nemesis. It killed everyone while they were having fun in VR. Also, it used their future technology against them. The tribal societies on Earth aren't so reliant on that technology and also have time to prepare for its arrival.</p><p>You also learn the extinction signal sent to HADES stopped when you defeated it in the last game. Horizon Forbidden West ends two years after the events of the first game, so presumbly Nemesis has been in transit to Earth for 2 years already. It took the Zeniths about 18 years to get to Earth from Sirius (even though the intial trip from Earth to Sirius was 300 years), so maybe we have 15-16 years to prepare? Maybe less since they aren't going to age up Aloy to 35 years old for the next one.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181343_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Burning Shores</b></div><p>The story continues with the DLC entitled Burning Shores. After counting all the Zenith corpses, only 12 out of 13 have been found. One Zenith cannot be found and now there's a signal and energy surge coming from the south. In the first game, you are traveling around the midwest areas of the United States with a lot of Colorado. In this game, you continue west and go to Nevada, Utah, and Northern California, with distinct buildings and locations in Las Vegas and San Francisco. Burning Shores brings you to Los Angeles and Hollywood.</p><p>One thing to note about Burning Shores is that the environments are far more detailed than the full game. While the main game runs on both Playstation 4 and 5, Burning Shores is PS5 exclusive, allowing the environments to look more detailed than before. Textures are richer. Lighting is more dynamic. On the other hand, you only have one complete environment to work with in Burning Shores, so everything looks pretty similar.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250517181502_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The overall story of the DLC isn't really all that special. Walter Londra, the remaining Zenith, went to Los Angeles. He apparently never liked his companions and was planning of separating from them and building a spacecraft of his own with rocket engines developed by his company in the 21st century. </p><p>Along the way, he meets the splintered group of Quen, a Hawaiian tribe who you met in San Francisco. They also have focuses and their society was based on the knowledge they've learned from the resources they had. Londra appeared to the Quen as a god and indoctrinated some members into following him like a god. Whatever world he escapes to, he'd didn't want to be there by himself. He plans on taking some women with him to rebuild his society with him as their emperor at the top.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250518154050_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As you arrive in Burning Shores, you meet Seyka, a member of the Quen tribe, but doesn't quite fit in. Her life somewhat mirrors your life of being an outcast, but she has a family and her sister has come with her to California. Currently, her sister, Kina, has been kidnapped by Londra, and you work together with Seyka to rescue her.</p><p>Much like before, I'm not really interested in this tribal stuff. I only care about Londra and how his story gives us more information about the Zeniths and the incoming threat of Nemesis. Ultimately, we're never really given any substantial information about that. We learn a little about Londra and how he sucks, just like all the other rich people. Londra falls back into the cartoony evil pattern. After a pretty amazing-looking final battle with a Horus, Londra is killed. Later, we learn Londra was part of the Nemesis project and his consciousness is part of Nemesis. Londra also theorized that 21st century weaponry could probably be used against it.</p><p>The few scraps of Future Past lore is disappointing. But, it turns out that the true focus of Burning Shores is Seyka.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211612_t.webp" /></a></p><p>What?! Aloy kisses a lady?</p><p>After the final battle with Londra and tying up lose ends in town, Aloy meets Seyka on a cliff, and Seyka says she wants to be with you. The game gives you 3 options: Yes, No, and This is too much. Seemed like a odd choice for just having a character joining you. If you say yes, then Aloy says she has feelings for Seyka, too, and they embrace and kiss.</p><p>All of this felt like it came out of no where. You are running through the DLC with her, killing a bunch of robots and people, and ultimately saving her sister and crew. But, the relationship never felt anything more than any other friend from the main game. You helped her out with some of her personal problems, but you've been doing that the whole game with all your friends. Even the 3-way choice didn't feel like it was going in this direction.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211537_t.webp" /></a></p><p>That's not too say the relationship doesn't make sense. It is totally within Aloy's character to have romantic feelings for a woman and even want a relationship. Elizabet had been in a same-sex relationship with Tilda, and Aloy never considered that to be anything but natural. Also, in the first game, Aloy had rejected the feelings of other men. I think both Erand and the Sun-King wanted relationships or marriages. Although, those relationships always seemed too one-sided.</p><p>Overall, for such an important event in Aloy's life and something I would expect the developers to celebrate, it's shoved at the end of a paid DLC only accessible after finishing the main game, which it seemed like many people didn't finish because of the length. Then, it's also behind a "choose your ending."</p><p>It feels more like fantasy rather than a moment that the developer's intended.</p><p>Whatever choice you make, Aloy says goodbye to Seyka, and Seyka returns to her people, probably never seeing you again. So, this whole plot point seems like its thrown away, anyways.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/horizon_2/Horizon_Forbidden_West_20250521211757_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The ending to Burning Shores was a bit odd, but the conclusion to Forbidden West was pretty satisfying. While I don't think Forbidden West hit the story highs of the first game, it was a far more well-rounded experience, and by the end, I cared much more about all aspects of the story compared to Zero Dawn.</p><p>I'm excited for the end of the trilogy, but I think Guerrilla Games has an uphill battle making the game a success. To get the full story of Horizon, you need to play the games in order, and asking people to go through a 60-hour game and a 100-hour game to prepare is too much of an ask, even if its worth it.</p><p>They have made efforts to keep Horizon in public consciousness. They made that Lego Horizons game, along with a Lego model toy line. And apparently, they plan on making some kind of multiplayer game with the Horizon license.</p><p>Maybe next year, we'll get our first glimpse at the game. But either way, I'm certainly excited to see how they decide to end it. Hopefully, they can pull off a satisfying end.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freeways" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freeways">Freeways</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's a pretty simple PC puzzle game where you draw freeways! As you click into a single map, the sides of the screen haves roads either entering or exiting the screen. Each road wants to connect to another road on the side of the screen, or to a building in the middle of the screen. To create the road, you draw it with the mouse. Right click for bridges!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_21.09.26.webp" /></a></p><p>When you complete the roadways on the map, you click simulate and traffic pours into your roads. You are graded based on the complexity (difficulty) of the map, the amount of concrete you used, and the efficiency of the traffic, which is measured in its average speed through your roads. Occassionally, a map will have a score goal you should try to achieve. Getting the goal will unlock a photo of a real highway interchange to inspire more road building.</p><p>The YouTube channel I was following is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RealCivilEngineerGaming" title="https://www.youtube.com/@RealCivilEngineerGaming">Real Civil Engineering</a>. Apparently the guy worked in civil engineering for a while, and then quit to do YouTube stuff. His Freeways videos were fun because he often talked about the most efficient ways of building highway interchanges using the least amount of concrete and other strategies. After hearing about it enough, I wanted to try it, too.</p><p>Freeways was released in 2017 for iOS, PC, and Mac. I started playing it in January. There was a sale so it was only $5. BUT! It just so happened that after 8 years of no updates, Freeways got a full new expansion on Jan 28th for free!</p><p>The original game had 80 maps, and the new expansion gave us 81 new maps! So many maps! Many of these new maps were much harder than the original. Also, every map now had a target score to try and surpass. </p><p>And as another new feature, the game now had achievements! Only 4 achievements, though. Two of the achievemements were achieving all the goals on individual maps. The other two achievements were about surpassing a specific World Efficiency. World Efficiency is your grand total score of all your map scores on original and expansion maps. The original map efficiency score was 25000. The expansion map efficiency score was 40000.</p><p>After 3 months, I finally finished all of the new maps, and got all the achievements. Here are the maps of my roads.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.16.06.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/freeways/Screenshot_2025-04-20_at_18.15.55.webp" /></a></p><p>Freeways is a fun game.

Lord Shimura is the jito (or ruler) of Tsushima, holding together the clans of the island.</p><p>You play as Sakai Jin, Shimura's nephew is the only surviving samurai of the battle of Komoda beach, where the clans of the island led by Shimura met the landing parties of the mongols, and lost. After being revived from your wounds, you awake to the open world of Tsushima, roaming the island to help those in need and gain support to overthrow Kublai Khan, currently occupying Kaneda castle, with your uncle Lord Shimura as captive.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224164214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224164214.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224164214_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224164214_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224164214_t.webp"/></a></p><p>This is where I'm at in the game so far, around 20 hours into Act 1. There are probably three acts, plus an extra area available the DLC expansion. So far, I think it's been a pretty benign experience, but I have been focusing solely on the open world elements of the game, rather than the story.</p><div class='title'><b>Story thus Far</b></div><p>Being Samurai is at the heart and soul of Ghosts, and this seems like the direction the story is headed. Ghosts describe Samurai as fearless just warriors who stand up and fight against all odds even at the cost of their lives. However, as a single warrior, you are constantly fighting against these odds. While it is the most honorable route, it is also the most foolish when it is not feasible or possible to win using such direct single-minded tactics.</p><p>A woman named Yuna had rescued you from Komoda beach. She moves undetected through grass, and cuts down the mongol enemies when they are unready. Moves deemed cowardly and underhanded from the point of view of a samurai. Dishonorable.</p><p>Through gameplay, Ghosts offers you two approaches to every battle: face your enemies head on, or pick off enemies one by one without being detected. There are a few glimpses of Jin struggling with his strict samurai code of honor when relying on stealth techniques too much. Hopefully it'll become core to the story.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>In most games, stealth is almost always the way to go. Fighting battles head on tend to overwhelm and you end up using more resources. So, it's best to pick off enemies one by one to even the odds before hopping in to finish the squirmish. Why fight five dudes at once, when you can end up fighting either one or two?</p><p>Ghosts has a nice gameplay solution for this as a Stand Off. Reveal yourself to the enemy and face them directly in a duel. Hold down the button and release right as they strike for an instant kill. This skill can be upgraded to take out three enemies at once, leaving only a few left to deal with after.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It ends up becoming a much faster way of dealing with groups of enemies then using stealth, too. The game gives you a lot of tools and methods of taking down enemies, but I really haven't had a need to learn any of them. Dudes attack, I parry, then slash slash slash. This results in almost all battles ending up into the same battle again and again.</p><div class='title'><b>Exploration</b></div><p>In open world games, exploration is of absolute importance to me. Once free to explore, I immediately run off into the woods to find secrets, caves, dungeons, and items. Ghosts has plenty of that content. Pieces of map and points of interests reveal as you explore rather than having everything available as you start, which both encourages exploration and doesn't overwhelm with a thousand checkboxes on a to-do list. It allows you to play the game at your own pace.</p><p>There are a lot of dynamic environments that light up with the sunrise or sunset, like the golden forest of ginko trees and open fields full tall grass blowing in the moonlight. It's not too difficult to get some pretty shots with the amazing <b>Photo Mode</b>. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522_t.webp"/></a></p><p>Unfortunately, most of the shots end up looking the same. There's a distant visual tone to Ghosts, but none of the environments end up feeling distinct themselves. It's just the same areas with different colored trees or with higher rocks. Many of the buildings are copies of the same models used in other villages. Even the villagers are just copied over and over again.</p><p>For an open world game, it ultimately feels somewhat closed and limited. I feel like I had already hit the boundaries of the world (both literally and creatively) after 5 hours, and these last 15 hours have just been cleanup, making my way through repetitious open world side stories and ticking collectibles off a list. It's all pretty standard boring open world elements. Go here, pick up this, go there, kill this person.</p><p>Comparing worlds, Red Dead Redemption 2, which had been released two years prior to Ghosts, was a game that continued to feel alive and fresh for hours and hours, both in story and in environment. Everything in that game felt hand crafted and lived in. People felt real, too. It felt like an actual world. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ghosts feels more like a high quality copy of Assassin's Creed so far with a lot of paint on the outside to distract you from what's underneath.</p><div class='title'><b>History</b></div><p>With the release of Shogun last year, I've been thinking about and contextualizing Japanese history more than I had before. Shogun's story focused on a fictional version of Tokugawa and his actions leading to the Battle of Sekigahara. With his win, he assumes control of Japan as shogun ushering in the Edo Period in 1603.</p><p>Shogun was the title given to the military leader of Japan, who actually executed laws and governship through the words of the Emperor. This term originated in the Kamakura Period of Japan, which is when Ghosts takes place.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura_period" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura_period">Kamakura shogunate</a> overthrew the Emperor in 1185 and established themselves as the rulers of Japan. This was the first point in history where the Emperor did not "control" the country. As each territory and kingdom pledged their loyalty, high ranking soldiers within clans of those territories became deputized as samurai, a new kind of soldier.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Samurai had more power than standard soldiers as they could execute the will and actions of their lords as they see fit, rather than waiting for orders. At this time, the samurai designation was mostly reserved for members of the ruling class. But over time, more and more soldiers and members of clans became worthy of the title.</p><p>Again, Ghosts takes place around 1274 during the mongolian invasion, at the height of the Kamakura shogunate. Focusing only on military strength and expansion became their downfall as the government never actually produced anything to pay their subjects. The Emperor regained their power in 1333, starting the Muromachi Period. </p><p>Understanding the need to be suspicious of others and the benefits of working under darkness, breaking the code of samurai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja#Predecessors" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja#Predecessors">Ninja</a> spies were officially trained and designated around the mid-1400s as the Emperor was overthrown again, fracturing Japan, and starting the Warring States Period of Japanese history.</p><p>Tactics of Ninja and Shinobi existed before the Warring States Period, but those terms were never used until then, and those actions were always viewed negatively until then.</p><p>It's interesting how these beliefs have been woven into the story of Ghosts. It's a bit unfortunate how the game doesn't contextualize any of this history. But, on the other hand, Ghosts seems to  accurately adhere to it, which is commendable compared to other fairytale stories of samurai made by poorly researched westerners.</p><p>The developer, Sucker Punch, has a clear reverence of the material and culture. This was even clear from the start when leading up to the announcement of the game at E3 2018. They had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Boots" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Boots">Cornelius Boots</a>, one of the world's leading masters of the shakuhachi, a traditional Japanese wooden flute, put on a performance. Although, because of the military rule of Kamakura, these performances had diminished greatly at this time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Sequel</b></div><p>Shogun was one of the main reasons I had become interested in playing through Ghosts of Tsushima. But another reason was because of the sequel announced last year. Sucker Punch unveiled Ghosts of Yotei in September 2024 and announced its release for 2025. I wanted to finish the first game before the new one came out.</p><p>They announced that Yotei is not a direct sequel to Ghosts of Tsushima, taking place in 1603. This was the time that Tokugawa had just taken control of Japan and began instituting rules upon rules to strictly govern the country and prevent any uprising or opposition to his rule or weakening Japan to foreign entities.</p><p>It was also announced that Yotei takes place in Hokkaido. Prior to 1603, the Japanese (or Wajin) have only occupied the southern area of Hokkaido, while the rest of the island was home to its natives, known as Ainu. Japan wanted to strengthen its hold on Hokkaido (known as Ezo at the time) to prevent any possibly invasion from Russia.</p><p>Over the next hundred years, conflict and bloody battles erupted between the natives and Japanese before the entire island eventually came under Japanese rule. You play as Atsu, a female warrior, probably of the Ainu, through the origin of these conflicts.</p><p>No idea what time of year it'll take place, but the overall vibe should be a lot of mountain climbing and snow, compared to the sub-tropical island of Tsushima.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing</b></div><p>Anyways, I'm a bit down on Ghosts at the moment, but this is mostly tempering my expectations. I'm really surprised how the environments and interactions feel so old, when the game was released in 2020. This was the height of the Playstation 4, moments before the release of the PS5. Games had already been out by then with significantly more character in their story and engagement in their environments.</p><p>I'm right at the edge of the next significant story progression, so I hope things turn around.</p><p>I've taken a bunch of in-game photos, too. You can view them below.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okami" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okami">Okami</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I feel like everyone knows Okami and everyone loves Okami, but has everyone really played it? I don't think it really gets brought up in conversations past its art style. That's the camp I was in. I really liked the idea of Okami. I even bought it back in the day, but never really played it.</p><p>At the Game Awards, an Okami Sequel was announced, which put the original game back on my immediate backlog. With revisiting a lot of classic games lately, I wanted to finally give Okami its shot.</p><p>And, it's incredible. (I played through the PS4 version of Okami HD)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241229122854_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241228213941_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Nearly 20 years after its original release, its art style still looks fresh and stunning. The heavy thick black inked outlines create imagery invoking Japanese calligraphy and traditional painting matching the fairytale story it tells.</p><p>The story of the game starts like a fairytale, explaining a 100-year-old legend, a battle between the ultimate evil, the 8-headed serpent Orochi, being defeated by a hapless warrior, Nagi, and a wolf. The wolf was killed in battle, so the town erected a statue in her honor. Now, 100 years later, you emerge from the statue, a reincarnation of the wolf and the goddess of the sun, Okami Amaterasu. Someone broke the seal of Orochi, which has released you from the statue, so you now explore the land, cleanse the land of its curse, defeat his minions, and make your way to its layer reenacting the legend.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241230002403_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Okami is a very standard action adventure game which feels reminiscent of early 3D Legend of Zelda games. Through exploring, more areas of Japan are opened with more secrets and introducing more characters. Story sequences thrust you into exploring dungeons and defeating the monsters within. This results in giving you new weapons and abilities to expand your exploration in the world and also backtracking for previous secrets.</p><p>The abilities you gain are executed using brush strokes. Hit the R1 button, and the whole scene pulls back to an inking canvas. Move the brush around to create strokes matching your abilities. Return to the scene, and the abilities execute by blooming trees, slashing enemies, and blowing wind.</p><p>Much like classic Zelda games, the story really opens up after completing the initial story sequence, the recreation of the 100-year legend. Evil still reigns in further areas of Japan, so you continue to chase after the shadows of the true evil.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20241231220110_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Up until this point, I had not really noticed how much of Okami was steeped in Japanese fairytales. I thought it was telling its own story. I did not know that the story of Orochi and Nagi was an actual Shinto tale until reaching the next section of the game.</p><p>When reaching the major city, you meet Momotaro, try to locate Onigashima, also meet Urashimataro, and swim to the bottom of the sea to Ryuguujou (the Dragon Palace), and meet Otohime. You also meet Princes Sakuya, cut from Bamboo. These are all Japanese tales I'm quite familiar film. Momotaro and Onigashima is probably the most well known fairytale in Japan. All the kids here know it. The One-Inch Prince is another Japanese tale that I had read before and never made the connection to Issun, your companion throughout the whole game.</p><p>I'm not a Japanese fairytale or mythical expert, so many of these things went over my head on their first pass, but it never detracted from the experience for me. All of these stories felt natural within the story of Okami. There are fun references to real lore that really enhance the experience rather than use it as a crutch.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250101114445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was really surprised by Okami. The Japanese mythology, the overall structure and crafted nature of the gameplay and exploration, and the length of the game. I completed a full 100% playthrough in 52 hours. That's the same length as Twilight Princess, which came out a few months after Okami's original release.</p><p>Overall, I think a lot of people skipped Okami because the Playstation 2 was waning at that point. The Xbox 360 was released the year prior, and games looked FAR more incredible than the PS2. Okami released in September, and in just a few more months, the Playstation 3 and Nintendo Wii would be released. The future!</p><p>Personally, I was so busy finishing college in Spring and study abroad in Japan for my final semester in the Fall. When I came back in 2007, I immediately played Twilight Princess and then focused on other games.</p><p>Also, as much as the art style is one of Okami's strongest points, cell shading was very divisive at the time. People hated Legend of Zelda Wind Waker because of its art style, and Twilight Princess was finally the realistic Zelda everyone wanted. I think this looked too "kiddy" for the PS2 crowd.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/okami/OKAMI_HD_20250102112322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm glad that I finally took the time to play through Okami, and I think more people really should do the same. Now that Okami finally has a second chance with this new sequel, I hope people actually buy into it. </p><p>I'll be there.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Callisto Protocol" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

But, this game ends up living in the shadow of another, which dominates the conversation. </p><div class='title'><b>Derivative</b></div><p>As much as Callisto Protocol may want to stand on its own, it's hard to talk about it without talking about <a href="/old/v7/dead-space" title="/dead-space">Dead Space</a>. Callisto Protocol comes from one of the original creators of Dead Space, and has some members of the old team, too. Callisto tries its best to emulate what made Dead Space so great, but fails on almost every front. It takes some cues from <a href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us-part-2" title="/the-last-of-us-part-2">Last of Us</a> as well, but it feels like a rip-off.</p><div class='title'><b>Enemies and Combat</b></div><p>Oh, we be fighting zombies again.</p><p>Both Dead Space and Last of Us have zombies and while the high points of both those games go far behind their enemy designs, the enemies are still interesting. The necromorphs in Dead Space had a very dynamic design that supported the combat. The infected in Last of Us were detailed enough that you could see how the fungal infection grew and mutated their bodies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yep, that's a zombie. In Callisto, the biophages just look like dudes with skin problems. Later, you fight some others that look like Clickers from Last of Us. And then you fight deaf zombies EXACTLY like Clickers from Last of Us.</p><p>One departure from Dead Space is that Callisto isn't a shooter first, but a brawler. You bob and weave incoming attacks and counter with a melee weapon, so it makes sense the zombies are more like crazed humans. But now we're doing Arkham Batman combat, and Arkham Batman combat was not this stiff. Batman combat was designed around fighting multiple enemies at once, and you could react to them working together.</p><p>Callisto often struggles with this. Every attack has weight to it, but that weight often pushes you into a position you don't want. Other enemies then attack or you get stuck in a corner looking the wrong direction. It hard to tell where enemies are coming from if they aren't in front of you. Jacob isn't nimble enough to run around and take out enemies, so you always have to focus on them one-at-a-time, which slows down the game.</p><p>And you're already moving pretty slow. In Dead Space, Isaac's slow movement made sense because you're moving around in a 200lbs suit meant for protection from environmental and occupational hazards. You're like a tank. In Callisto, you're only wearing a cloth prison jump suit. Jacob isn't some huge muscle dude, either. He looks like he could sprint down a hall way and slip past a group of people. Later, you get an EVA suit, but it looks flexible enough to move easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment and Immersion</b></div><p>One of the key points of Dead Space was its immersive environment supported by the heavy futuristic machinery, dynamic lighting and color, and a sharp distinct and unique set of sounds that overwhelmed you. Incorporating all of the HUD and UI elements into the character and environment made you feel immersed in the world.</p><p>Last of Us had a similar approach. There were still some UI elements that assisted the player through exploration and combat, but the lack of music and use of silence matched with the vibrant lush overgrown environments which immersed me in the exploration of Seattle and listening for the subtle movements of enemies around blind corners.</p><p>Both games felt designed around the opportunity to give creative people a chance to make the most of their opportunities, and create dynamic and memorable experiences. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Callisto has some unique areas, but the first half of the game is moving through drab metal hallways and then the prison's sewer system. Lots of pipes and moving through vents. The arboretum is a nice area, but it's dark and muddy. Later, you visit an old mining area. The density of buildings and their layout is interesting, but the buildings themselves aren't very interesting. The environments are definitely detailed, but they don't really inspire creativity in me. It feels too restrictive.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest flop of Callisto is its lack of dynamic sound. There's no unique sound of heavy machinery working. There's no sharp crack of gun fire or welding tools. There's no use of silence to accent the enemies movements. And overall, the music is pretty generic and used too frequently. There are no surprises or memorable experiences through sound, which dampens the overall experience.</p><p>Thankfully, the monotony is broken up by breaking out onto the surface of Callisto. You put on an EVA and are shot out into the environment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow is pushed around by your foot steps and moving gates. While trying to find your way to the space depot, the blizzard often overwhelms your vision. At least now, Jacob's slow lumbering movements make sense. If Jacob could move faster or more dynamically, I would've loved to stay outside longer, but everything just seems to weigh down the experience that I want to move on to the next section as quick as possible.</p><p>In the end, we get another unique area, the clean living area of the administration.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The game could've used more unique areas like this. But, we're in a prison and we're climbing through sewers and mines. There aren't many opportunities to have fantastical elements while making the setting down-to-earth. Perhaps Callisto Protocol tries to bring too much reality to its setting. As a result, all of the edges feel sanded off.</p><div class='title'><b>What a Twist!</b></div><p>Through attempting to escape, you journey into the depths of Callisto to an abandoned mining colony from 75 years ago, and discover the truth of the biophage outbreak. Can you guess?</p><p>Oh, it turns out the government was behind the biophage attack on Europa, not the terrorists. And the terrorists were people caught up in the attack who blamed the government. The reason you were caught up in everything, too, was because the medical supplies you transported to Europa were hiding the viral agent that started the outbreak.</p><p>75 years ago, the first outbreak occurred in this mining colony as the scientists responsible for the biophage tested their progress. Once the outbreak was concealed, the prison was built on top of it to continue testing the biophage virus on inmates.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was aliens all along. The miners had discovered the corpse of a massive alien and studied its secrets. The government agency funding this science believed the larvae of the alien could help human ascend to the next level of evolution allowing them to expand within the universe further. The biophage virus was the result of their research, and injecting humans was meant to make them impervious to the harsh environment of space. But, whatdya know, it just turned them into monsters.</p><p>The Callisto Protocol is the development of this biophage to push humanity to the next level of evolution, and its eventually release and conversion of all humanity.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They got pretty close making an evolved human with this guy. But eventually he also turns into a mindless monster and you gotta shoot him in the face anyway. With their prime experiment defeated, the government (actually a crazed religious group) sets the prison to self-destruct. With only one escape pod available, you shove your friend into it and she escapes along with records of the event and a sample of the virus.</p><p>You are still stuck on the planet and the game ends as the monster jumps at you. No real ending, just a few words and cut to black.</p><div class='title'><b>Continued in DLC</b></div><p>In the $15 DLC, the story continues. You wake up with the doctor speaking to your through an earpiece. Get up! There are more secrets to be had! You travel to her lab and her hologram explains about the further experiments and atrocities. There was a competing experiment being held to push humans to the next stage of evolution. And you find out that the doctor led the project.</p><p>You stumble further down into her lab into far more interesting, detailed, and amazing looking areas than the main game. Areas use a lot of orange light to break away from the boring metal blue walls and floors. Bio-matter spreads and grows from the walls transforming it into an alien or infested looking environment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It is often difficult to tell whether something is going to come out of the wall to get you, or whether danger is just around the corner. The terrible "mood" music and jump scares are turned down and used in actual appropriate moments compared to the main game.</p><p>Sanity effects are now used, too, as it feels like Jacob is slowing falling apart mentally. You open up a treasure chest to receive nothing, and turn around to find the chest in front of you again, but unopened. You move down a hallway as enemies continuously attack you, not realizing the path forward is to turn around.</p><div class='title'><b>A New Enemy</b></div><p>Something new appears in the depths of the labs.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The prison bots from before have been infected and fused with bio-matter making them stronger and more aggressive than before. It's still not too difficult to dodge out of the way and slam them with your electrified police baton, though.</p><p>However, as you enter the laboratory in the police bot factory, your baton is destroyed after beating a bot over and over again to its death. Your main weapon used throughout the entire game and a fundamental staple of how the game play works is removed from your arsenal. You can no longer easily dodge and counter enemies. The brawler has turned into a clumsy shooter.</p><p>It's not long before you are chased into a test room with bots closing in on all of your sides when you obtain the best funnest weapon in the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hammer replaces your police baton and smashes through bots after a few hits. Zombies from before are cut through like butter. Up until this point, the whole game felt like you're fighting against the gameplay. Eventually you find a rhythm that works, but it ends up becoming a single use solution to every encounter. Now you feel incredible and powerful by slicing and smashing through everything that sucked about the game before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Reason</b></div><p>As mentioned earlier, the Callisto Protocol is the development of the biophage to push humanity into the next stage of evolution. Their main plan ended up turning people into zombie monsters.</p><p>The doctor had a different idea and tried to compete with them. The doctor created these bio-bots as her solution to humanity's evolution. The bots were fused with human skin, muscles, and brain using the alien biophage material. Human consciousness was then uploaded into the bots for humanity to live on forever.</p><p>It didn't work. Just like the zombies, the bots became mindless machines of destruction and ripped apart anything that was human, relying too much on the prison's programming.</p><div class='title'><b>The Ending</b></div><p>The doctor had been luring you further into the depths of the lab to reach an escape pod she had prepared for herself. As you arrive near the hatch, the doctor is grabbed by a robot. The bot infects and mutates the doctor into an abomination that you juke, jive, and smash until it's dead. With the doctor's voice still in your ear, you proceed to the escape pod.</p><p>The escape pod is your ship, though. It's your destroyed ship that crashed into Callisto in the beginning. The doctor directs you to hop on the controls and get out of there. You escape the prison, escape the moon. You continue to fly as far away as fast as you can. And space begins to light up. The light gets brighter and brighter to point where you can't see anything but white.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's done. You're done. You're dead. You've been dead this whole time.</p><p>As your friend had escaped earlier with all the lab's data, you were killed as the enemies closed in. The doctor found your body, and ignited the few remaining sparks in your brain. The doctor used the implant in your head linked to your friend in order to send the remaining data she had exposing the government's horrific projects on Callisto, and her involvement in the project.</p><p>It felt like the DLC was going to give some full closure to the ending. And I suppose it did. Callisto Protocol no longer ends on a cliffhanger. But, it's not a happy ending and it completely closes the book on Jacob's story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Real Life Ending</b></div><p>Most people feel cheated by the ending, and further cheated by paying $15 to get an ending that punches them in the face.</p><p>The publisher ultimately is to blame for the abrupt ending and pay-per-view ending. Krafton cut the development time towards the end of the project and forced the release date ahead of schedule. New enemy types were scrapped from the game, and the ending had to be reworked into what we got. It's pretty obvious that some of those scrapped ideas were remolded into the DLC ending.</p><p>It's poetic and perhaps intentional that the final scene is of Jacob's horrific torn-apart corpse, a signal from the developer that there is no future for this game, and a metaphor of what the developers perhaps consider the result of their ideas and hard work after the publisher forced their hand.</p><p>It sucks even more that after the release of the DLC, the developer laid off employees as the publisher realigned the focus of the studio.</p><p>I think it's easy to say Callisto Protocol is kinda lame and not all that great, but I think the DLC shows that this game and its developer had the potential to make something better and more compelling than what we got. Not everyone gets a blank check, though. And very few publishers want to take a risk. Everything has to be a financial hit these days. There's no longer any room for mediocrity even if it has some kernels of something good.</p><p>Anyways, I'm glad I played it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space">Dead Space</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Ishimura is a massive mining starship in orbit above the planet Aegis VII, and the distress call was the last communication with anyone on board. Among the Kellion's sparse crew is Isaac Clarke, an engineer.</p><p>As Clarke and the Kellion crew board the derelict malfunctioning ship, they are attacked by transformed mutated members of the crew, known as Necromorphs. The Kellion is destroyed, and Clarke and a few other members of the Kellion begin to explore and repair the Ishimura in order to escape and find out what happened to the crew.

Originally released in 2008, Dead Space become one of the genres best examples of survival horror done right, but eventually the series fizzled out as it became more action oriented, which was reason enough for Electronic Arts to shut down the developer's studio. </p><p>Thankfully, EA Motive, the developers of this 2023 remake, insisted that this new game stick closely to its 2008 original, which I consider the best in the series.</p><div class='title'><b>Immersion</b></div><p>Dead Space was unique upon release as one of its strict design ideas was using absolutely no HUD. All ammo, health, and menus are displayed within the universe of the characters, as if the character themselves are looking at and using those displays. All button prompts appear on the objects in the environment. If a menu appears, it comes from Isaac's computer Rig on his wrist, and he looks at it when you select menu items.</p><p>Although, the true crown of Dead Space's immersion is the Audio. The Ishimura is a very dense, heavy, mining vessel. All the different areas have their thick heavy machines, and these machines are all distinct and loud. Often when you enter a new area, you become completely overwhelmed by the sounds of the machinery.</p><p>One of my favorite areas in the original was Engineering. As you kickstarted the engines, the overall sound was so loud you couldn't hear any enemies or footsteps or menu movements. It was a constant blast of sound until you exited the room. This area still exists in the remake, but they moved it into a corridor instead of the overall room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Isaac is really just a repairman, and all of your weapons futuristic versions of welders, strippers, nail guns, and such. All of these guns have very powerful and electrical cracks and bursts that you may hear at a futuristic construction site. All these sounds feel like they split your ears as you rip apart the space zombies. With your heavy, 200lbs armored suit, you can also stomp them into the ground with a satisfying crunch.</p><p>Everything in the environment and everything you do comes with a heavy mechanical organic weight to it. It's criminal if you don't play this game with headphones turned up to 11.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, one of the most impactful and immersive sequences is the first time you open a door, and all of the air and sound get blasted into space from a violent hull breach. Your suit's boots are magnetized so space walking is no problem, but the first time you get thrust into space feels like going over the top of a rollercoaster. It feels like part of your own breath was sucked into space, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Haunted House</b></div><p>As you continue to explore and repair the Ishimura, you move into new areas of the ship with new monsters. Often you'll reach a place of relatively quiet, only for a monster to SCREAM at you as it burst out of the ceiling or a nearby wall. This happens pretty often. As the game's sound fully immerses you in the environment, it tends to employ startling scare tactics.</p><p>You get pretty powerful later on in the game, so when a standard zombie pops out of the wall, you can quick shoot it or bash it into the ground. Even when a bunch of zombies come at you at once, you can usually take them all at once with your arsenal. So, many of these sequences turn into a corner of a haunted house. Boo!</p><p>But, the first time you fight a Brute can make you feel powerless. A brute is a gigantic zombie about the size of a car. When it comes rushing towards me and my gunfire has absolutely no effect, my next instinct is to run! But then the heavy suit makes it feel like you're trying to run in water, and its huge stomping lumbering movements are right on your heels. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are some genuine fearful movements as you try to evade death, but ultimately, you can overcome these moments by trying again after you die. Later on, you learn about the best ways of killing things by fighting the zombies over and over again.</p><div class='title'><b>Retro</b></div><p>People generally define retro games as anything made over 10 years ago. This was an easy statement to make in the PS3/360 era of gaming, as each new console had some genuine easy-to-see graphical and design improvements over the previous generation. For example, Super Mario World and Super Mario Sunshine were 11 years apart, and the difference between those games of the same series is absolutely massive. The jump from 2D to 3D was huge, but so is the idea of having to explore the world to find levels, having a more involved story with characters having motivations, and talking with characters to find more things.</p><p>The time difference between the original Dead Space and this remake is 15 years, and the overall game hasn't really changed at all. The graphics have been modernized, and load times reduced because of current generation hardware. A few quality of life features added for smoother gameplay. Isaac talks now and involves himself in the story, too. But it's still the exact same game that I remember from the Playstation 3.</p><p>Are games from the PS3/360 era really retro if their game design still fits within the modern era of game design?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe some people consider games retro if they center on a single player experience. Most modern games today have some kind of social element, so you can share the experience with friends. Or they include some kind of open world experience, so it can feel like the game is endless and you can play for hours and hours.</p><p>Dead Space is a pretty tight 12 hour game, and adding any of those modern engagement traps would ruin the experience. But, at the same time, once you finish the game (and finish it a second time), you're pretty much done with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>After the original Dead Space, the studio became known as Visceral Games and made Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3, as well as Dead Space Extraction (a light gun game), and some novels and comics. Dead Space 2 was another high for the series, but I think there was never enough lore and story to carry it to a full never-ending franchise. Dead Space 2 started the series into something more action-oriented to appeal to a general audience, and Dead Space 3 killed the franchise and the developer.</p><p>The creator of Dead Space had actually left Visceral before Dead Space 2, and recently he helmed the creation of a new game, <a href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol" title="/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> released in 2022, which seems like an actual new Dead Space game in all but name. It's either ironic or malicious that EA came along with the Dead Space remake at the same time the original creator made a new one himself. However much of Visceral's former staff work at Motive and were key developers bringing this remake to life.</p><p>The Dead Space remake does an absolutely excellent job of sticking to the original but adding a few new things and changing others to make it even better. This remake doesn't really feel like a cash-grab. It feels like the people working on it genuinely cared about Dead Space and wanted to bring it back.</p><p>Unfortunately, it really sucks that the remake did not meet the sales EA was hoping for.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Through killing space zombies and finding some survivors, Isaac uncovers the truth of what happened on the Ishimura. Members of the crew became obsessed and possessed by the religion of Unitology, which revolves around an artifact found of Aegis VII, known as The Marker. The Marker slowly morphed the colonists of Aegis VII into the Necromorphs, which attacked and infected the crew of the Ishimura.</p><p>On the surface of Aegis VII is the Hive Mind, which controls all Necromorphs. In order to pacify and destroy it, Isaac brings the Marker back to the surface of Aegis VII. There are several other twists and turns along the way as Isaac is betrayed by his crew, and caught between the motives of Earth and the Church of Unitology. </p><p>In the end, it turns out that his love interest that he's been chasing the whole game killed herself prior to the Kellion arriving at the Ishimura. He's essentially been chasing a ghost through manipulation of the Marker and an Ishimura survivor. With nothing left, Isaac continues to kill the Hive Mind, and escape the surface as the gravity tethers holding the Ishimura are severed, which sends the ship and its moon-sized payload into the planet, eradicating all remaining life.</p><p>Finally Isaac gets to rest after a job well done.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Oh, except the Marker left its mark on Isaac. In the final moments of the game, the phantom of his girlfriend attacks him. Dead Space 2 picks up with Isaac awakening in an asylum above Saturn's moon of Titan, the doctors having extracted the remnants of the Marker from his brain.</p><div class='title'><b>New Ending</b></div><p>Now there's a new, alternate ending. As Isaac runs through the Ishimura a second time, small Markers are scattered throughout the ship. Collecting all of these Markers and placing them on their alters in the Captain's quarters will unlock this ending. Now, after Isaac pacifying the Hive Mind and letting the megaton payload destroy the surface, he is no longer so solemn.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With a course set back to Earth, he mentions to the phantom of his girlfriend that he needs to build something first before they can return. Isaac has been fully corrupted and possessed by the Marker, it seems.</p><p>Motive had plans to make a Dead Space 2, but as an alternate sequel rather than a remake of the original sequel. This sequel probably could've followed this new ending, and maybe implement some of the original ideas the creators had for Dead Space 2 back in the day, rather than some mandates EA imposed on Visceral.</p><p>EA seemed keen on continuing the remake series, but plans were scrapped as sales were poor. Motive is off working on other projects.</p><p>Dead Space is dead yet again.</p><div class='title'><b>Hope</b></div><p>I'm going to check out <a href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol" title="/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> next and see if there's any life.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cyberpunk 2077" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The 2.0 update brings a complete rewrite of progression through leveling, equipment, and other systems. Graphics have been updated for modern consoles and PCs. And a new expansion adds a new story that expands the life of Night City.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Night City is the setting of Cyberpunk, a sprawling multi-leveled metropolis. Depending on where you visit, it can be many things. It's a dark, dank, depressing slum festering with gangs, addicts, and trash. It's a futuristic neon haven vibrant with youth and life. It's a posh urban center of business and industry. It's a crime ridden war zone with constant shoot outs between cops and gangs.</p><p>No matter where you go, the city is dense. Many citizens live in massive mega buildings that act as their own cities. Stores and other places of interest are often on different levels forcing you traverse Night City's maze of verticality. Streets and highways bend and elevate to different areas. The native GPS in the game is a necessity.</p><p>Sprawling out from its dense centers, the outer edges of Night City has oil fields, solar collectors, and farm protected by greenhouses to sustain the massive amount of resources that fuel the city and its people. Small poor neighborhoods also grow on some pockets. Even further away are the badlands, a rocky desert where little grows and dust storms are common. There are also huge trash fields.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cyberpunk depicts a future where many of us think we're headed. Urban centers continue to collect more and more people, and the surrounding environment is ravaged of its resources to sustain them. Singular corporations rule the city and retain most of the wealth, which bleeds its citizens of their lives and dreams.</p><p>This is where the story begins as you play as V.</p><p>- - - - -</p><p>With the new update, I started a new character to see what the game now has to offer, and it's keeping my attention much more than before. I've been streaming it here and there, and taking plenty of photos along the way.

It has an expansive story between kingdoms and magic that spans 20 years with an incredibly satisfying end, but I think it fumbles some aspects that the Final Fantasy franchise prides itself upon.</p><div class='title'><b>The World of Valisthea</b></div><p>Final Fantasy XVI is set on the continents of Valisthea, which is divided between six nations in the beginning. Nations engage in war and alliances between each other to either preserve peace or expand their empire. A ravaging blight that spreads across areas of the continents forces these nations into cooperation or conflict.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp"/></a></p><p>Each kingdom's capital is built at the seat of a towering mother crystal. From mining the crystal, people are able to channel magic used for filling wells with water, or lighting fires used for cooking, etc. </p><p>There is a subset of humans known as bearers who are able to channel magical powers without the aid of crystals. Within the world, the general population considers bearers sub-human and treats them as slaves. Bearers are sold and used as tools for villages and armies and are often abused and lynched by their masters.</p><p>A very few select bearers are more than simple magic users, they are dominants. Dominants can channel divine beings known as Eikons (or Summons, in previous games). These Eikons are the embodiment of a magical alignment and are massive creatures that can easily destroy armies and cities with a single movement.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Only a few dominants are known at the beginning of the story, but there are a total of 8. Many of the kingdoms of Valiesthea have at least one among their ranks. Battles between nation's Eikons are rare as they are considered the nuclear option. If one nation began using its dominant to attack another, that nation would have to respond and would result in extensive losses on both sides. Plus, allied nations would have to respond as well. There is always a thin balance of peace and war.</p><p>Many kingdoms view dominants as divine humans and many dominants are part of the royal bloodline of the ruling class, but others view them as demons. A single human should not have control over power great enough to rip the world apart. One nation, The Iron Kingdom, regards them as abominations and puts any child to death that could possibly become a dominant.</p><p class='img'><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" /><br/>Cloth Map Scan: /ffxvi_cloth_map.png (205.9mb)</a></p></p><p>Overall, this is the world of Final Fantasy XVI at the beginning of the game. The Deluxe Edition of the game came with a cloth map of the world that I scanned and included above. The five mother crystals are pretty easy to see. The castle and capitol of each kingdom lies at the base of the crystal, with the exception of the red crystal to the west. It sits on an island between the Iron Kingdom in the southwest, and Rosaria on the mainland.</p><p>Years ago, there used to be a sixth crystal in the north which had its own kingdom. But the blight engulfed its land destroying the crystal, and completely severing the nation from its resources. All of the brown swaths across the map are areas ravaged by the blight, no longer able to sustain any life.</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>The story of FFXVI focuses on Clive Rosfield, the prince of Rosaria. Clive is the firstborn son of the king, Elwin Rosfield, and has a younger brother, Joshua. Clive attempted the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, but failed, so his mother, Annabella, rejects him for Joshua.</p><p>With the collapse of the northern kingdom, they attempted to invade Rosaria, but failed. To ensure peace with the remains of the north, the Rosfields took the princess, Jill Warrick, as ward. After the complete dissolution of the north, Jill remained in Rosaria and became like a sister to Clive and Joshua. They also have a dog, Torgal.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Story - The Beginning</b></div><p>In the beginning, Clive is a teenager and Joshua and Jill are still children. The Iron Kingdom is moving against Rosaria, so the Duke of Rosaria, Elwin Rosfield, father to Clive and Joshua, moves to attack them. Joshua had successfully completed the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, so Elwin brings him to the battle as a backup plan. Clive is Joshua's sworn Shield (protector), so he goes, too.</p><p>They travel to Phoenix Gate to prepare their battle plans, but their army is secretly attacked and killed in the night. Annabella betrays them and led the rival nation of Sanbreque to their location. Elwin Rosfield is killed, and Joshua awakens as the Phoenix. Another figure appears as awakens as a second Dominant of Fire, Ifrit. They battle, and the Phoenix is killed. Clive is taken by the Sanbreque army.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Good</b></div><p>The World and the Story of Final Fantasy XVI are the best aspects of the game. </p><p>The lore has been well thought out, and the general themes of Final Fantasy have been woven into the fabric of that lore. The conflicts between each country and people make sense and build the relationships between all of the characters in the game. The story takes a lot of inspiration from Game of Thrones, not only in its world building, but its adult story, too. People are killed in often brutal unexpected methods, including main characters.</p><p>The story is a little complicated, but the game has ample resources for you to keep up with the story and understand what's going on. There are two characters in your hideout that help you with this. One character shows the current political map both from the relationships between characters to the actual world map. Another character writes entries in his library about everything you encounter. Also, during action sequences, you can pull up "active lore" that shows all the information that led to the moment you're experiencing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Story - Continued</b></div><p>13 years pass, and Clive is a slave in the Sanbreque army. He vows revenge against his mother and against the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. During a battle between Dhalmekia and the Iron Kingdom, Clive finds Jill being used by the Iron Kingdom to wage war. He's ordered to kill Jill, but he kills his squad mates and the soldiers holding her captive instead, and they attempt to escape.</p><p>Cid, an outlaw who gives protection to bearers and dominants, finds them and rescues them from the battle. Cid's dream is to create a world where all mankind can be free. No one would keep another as a slave, nor look down on them as being different.  Clive agrees to help Cid find and free more bearers that have been enslaved and used by the kingdoms of Valisthea. </p><p>As they travel, they are attacked by Benedikta, the Dominant of Wind. As they battle, Clive pushes his use of magic passed his limits and transforms into Ifrit to defeat her. Clive realizes that he was the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. After the battle, he accepts what he has done. </p><p>Clive and Jill join Cid's group of outlaws to bring their idea of the peace to the world. Ultimately, in order to accomplish, Cid says that they must destroy the mother crystals. They infiltrate Sanbreque, and destroy their first mother crystal, but (<I>spoiler</I>) Cid is killed in the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With Cid gone, Clive takes the mantle of Cid, and for the next 7 years, they continue to free slaves and help everyone they can. Ultimately, they continue Cid's quest to destroy every mother crystal in Valisthea.</p><div class='title'><b>The Bad</b></div><p>Characters and Story are the backbone of every Final Fantasy game. Final Fantasy XVI excels at its expansive, well-thought-out story, but it focuses on a single point, Clive. The whole game revolves around Clive as the central figure responsible for nearly everything that happens in the world. </p><p>In the beginning, it seemed like all the kingdom and characters had agency in how the story and world was shaped.  But, after the second time skip to 20 years after the story began, all the other characters are mostly sitting by, idle, until Clive confronts them on his quest to destroy all the mother crystals.</p><p>The Gameplay is an extension of this as you only ever play as Clive. Perhaps the most controversial change from the Final Fantasy formula was making this more of a single character action game. Final Fantasy used to be the premiere Japanese RPG, where you control a party of characters who excel at magic and weapons. Final Fantasy VII Remake did an excellent job of adding modern action elements while still allowing you control multiple characters and balance your party. In Final Fantasy XVI, you get in a battle and just hack and slash to win. There's a little more than that, but every battle is pretty much the same.</p><p>Because Clive is such a focus in the story and gameplay, other characters get pushed into the background and out of sight. Even if other characters are with you, you almost never really notice. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Jill is an amazing character, and watching Clive and Jill's relationship grow over the course of the game is one of the highlights for me. But, once their relationship hits their peak and they admit and express their love for each other, Jill is pushed off to the side. She hangs back on the ship while you go into the next battle.</p><p>While this happens with most other characters in the game, it especially happens with all the women. Because Clive in the main focus of everything in the game, it pushes the masculine attitude that everything in the man's responsibility and everything must be done by the man, which is somewhat troubling given Final Fantasy's history of strong female characters.</p><p>The game does often recognize this, though, as characters will occasionally tell Clive that saving their world is everyone's responsibility, not just his. But, it is brushed off and forgotten as he continues to kill the next boss.</p><div class='title'><b>The Music</b></div><p>Music is another weak part of Final Fantasy XVI.  Final Fantasy prides itself on all of the music through the franchise, and even makes rhythm games to relive classic moments of your favorite games.</p><p>So much of the music from Final Fantasy XVI is forgettable. There are no strong melodic themes between all of the tracks, and often many of the songs are derivative of previous Final Fantasy music. It all sounds like filler music. There's no identity.</p><p>I almost never pay attention to the background music when playing the game. And now listening to the soundtrack on my computer, I find myself skipping many of the songs to try and find something interesting. No one is going to play these songs in Theatrhythm.</p><div class='title'><b>The Graphics, Art, and Performance</b></div><p>Back to the positives, the game looks absolutely stunning and plays like a dream.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The gameplay is pretty repetitive, but there is no point of any input lag between what I'm doing in battle. I'm always able to switch around to the skills that I want to use and evade when an attack is incoming.  Any time I get hit is because of my own screw up. Switching to Performance mode, the game doesn't keep a consistent 60 fps, but it's still quite fluid. Also, loading between scenes takes no more than 2 seconds. It's almost instant between changes map locations or starting a dialogue scene.</p><p>Much of the art direction is excellent, too, with creative and diverse kingdoms with sweeping landscapes. Although, many of the colors are very unsaturated. The world looks very drull and shabby. Many sequences are very dimly lit, too, making everything very dark. This is obviously the image they were going for, and it matches well with the story, but it doesn't make it very scenic. Also, halfway through the game, a spell is cast which darkens the skies and puts a purple hue on everything.</p><div class='title'><b>The End - Ultima</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" /></a></p><p><I>Spoilers</I> After destroying the first mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima reveals himself to you. Ultima is an unworldly mysterious figure who attempts to possess you, but is thwarted by Joshua, who is actually alive. As you take over Cid's quest and destroy crystal after crystal, Ultima's intentions reveal themselves.</p><p>Ultima is of a race of beings that existed long before humanity. The beings all had individual bodies, but shared a single consciousness. Together, they were all known as Ultima.</p><p>In the beginning, Ultima create magic, and with magic, life was created as well. Life flourished throughout the world, but a darkness was also born to balance the forces of nature. This darkness grew, consumed life, and Ultima could not stop its advancement. This was the blight.</p><p>The blight was unstoppable and Ultima had no means of saving their world. So, in order to survive, they had to create a new world where their lives could be born and grown again. To create a new world, they first had to find a land that was pure and untouched by the blight. This was impossible in their physical bodies, so they shed their corporeal forms to become a singular spirit. Then, they were able to find the pure lands of ancient Valisthea, rich in the life force known as Aether.</p><p>Being only spirit, Ultima had to plant the seeds of what they would become. They created the mother crystals in order to collect and channel the aether of Valisthea. And secondly, they created humanity. Over time, as humanity matured, they would be able to harness the power of the aether from the crystals. Each crystal bore a different tribe and different magic. One day, there would a single person who would be able to wield all of the magic. And this would be the person that Ultima had waited for. </p><p>Being able to receive all of the aether inside of himself, Ultima could possess this person and cast a spell that would bring them back to physical life in the world and paradise they had created.</p><p>With the world created, Ultima went to sleep and waited for the day when this person would emerge.</p><div class='title'><b>The End - Humanity</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From humanity's perspective, God had abandoned them. And without God to shape their morality and purpose, man had to find their own purpose. Some men desired power and used magic in order to claim it. Powerful men then led their nations in wars against each other in order to keep and expand their power. And with the overuse of magic, the blight had begun to form in Valisthea. Humanity now had its own purpose and will of their own, and God / Ultima was forgotten. </p><p>After Clive's destruction of the mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima had awaken to see that humanity had spun away from their purpose, his purpose.</p><p>Being able to steal and absorb the magical essence of others, Clive was the person that Ultima was waiting for.</p><p>While Fate had given Clive the ultimate power, it had also given Clive a torturous life of rejection and pain. Ultima needed Clive to give himself completely to Ultima in order for Ultima to become alive again.  But, with every obstacle in Clive's life, every death, every defeat, every failure, Clive continued for himself and the others in his life. </p><p>Humanity was its own being, it was no longer Ultima's to command. Creation of life does not serve as ownership.</p><p>So through the final battle, Clive finally punches God hard enough in the face, and God submits.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Clive absorbs the power from Ultima eradicating him and casts a spell that would remove all magic from the world, which ultimately stops the blight. By casting such a powerful spell, it's implied that Clive uses all the aether from within him and is turned to stone.</p><p>Millenia later, humanity lives on with the lives of Clive, Joshua, and the others becoming stories.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Despite its overall problems, this is the most well told Final Fantasy to date. It has an incredible story and very strong characters of Clive and Ultima. Because of the story, it makes sense that everything is funneled into a singular main character, and that everything is very linear.</p><p>Again, it's unfortunate that many other characters get shuffled off to the side. I think the story probably could have been reworked to give those characters more of a spotlight and perhaps made a party of characters. And having a more traditional party could have resulted in more interesting management of equipment and items.</p><p>But, would the game really have been better as a result? The story probably would have suffered, and they wouldn't have been able to completely tell the story that they wanted.</p><p>It's not perfect, but not every Final Fantasy has to be perfect.</p><p>I think the biggest problem with the previous game, Final Fantasy XV, was not having an overall vision from the beginning and trying to balance too many ideas at once. There was a lot of good with Final Fantasy XV, but that game was broken for a long time, and many of the story sequences are still not quite consistent after all the updates.</p><p>Final Fantasy XVI solved all those problems and created a very specific experience that is technologically sound and fantastic. The lows aren't too bad, and the highs are incredible.</p><p>Overall, I think it's excellent.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Horizon - Tallneck" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-horizon-tallneck">Lego Horizon - Tallneck</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Many fans of both Lego and Playstation praised the set for how authentic it looked to the game source. Modern Lego designers love to use Lego's vast library of pieces and colors in unique ways to create something that looks less and less like Lego each time.</p><p>Recently I had built the Lego Bonsai tree, and absolutely loved it. I'm not really a fan of Lego's aesthetic and blocky models, and both the Bonsai Tree and the Horizon Tallneck sets, as well as many other modern sets, try to hide these features as much as possible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp"></a></p><p>The Tallneck has so many rounded edges, curved surfaces, and off-angled lines that it looks more like a regular plastic model, rather than a Lego model. Even the joints for each leg have incredible articulation, like an action figure.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp"></a></p><p>Even though the set retails for $100, I was able to get a "used" set from Yahoo Auctions for $40. Used means that the set was already opened and built. They were selling it already built, too. But for that price, I could easily disassemble it and build it up again as if it were the first time.</p><p>The package was pristine when I received it in the mail and it included almost all of the original empty bags that hold the pieces. It was really easy to take apart and organize into its newly opened state.</p><p>Then, on May 13th, I streamed myself building it.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RckDOp3RbAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>It was fun putting it together, but I didn't really have the same energy that I had with the Bonsai Tree. Maybe it was because I had already seen it completed, so there weren't any surprises.  But, I don't really like the overall look in person. I feel like it still retains some of that block Lego aesthetic even though they try to hide it as much as possible. It's also really big.</p><p>Originally, I was planning on modifying the base to add the Bonsai tree to it, but the Tallneck completely towers over the tree. They don't really compliment each other after all.</p><p>I had it on my shelf for about a month, but I decided to take it down and take it apart again. You can see this progress in the photos below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp"></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The whole process is kind of like taking apart a puzzle after you build it.

If I wanted to make any additions to the set, or use it in some other way, it would always be the center piece. Everything else would have to complement it, rather than creating a balanced scene.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Last of Us Part 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last of Us Part 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Being able to stay in Seattle for days shows the full story of how a city had fallen and crumbled from the infection and how nature has begun to take it back. Vines, trees, and other vegetation had completely reclaimed the city in parts due to the constant overcast weather and rain. It all looks amazing.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230423102333.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230423102333.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230423102333_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230423102333_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230423102333_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230430100404.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230430100404.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230430100404_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230430100404_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230430100404_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The areas of Seattle are far larger than anything in Last of Us 1. Even though it's still quite linear, there are many places that are open to explore. Every journey from this corner of the city to that corner has weight to it, and it shows how incredibly strong you must be in order to get anywhere. The scale of this game is so impressive.</p><p>Several real world locations in Seattle were modeled for the game including the Seahawks stadium, the outside of the library, and the Seattle Convention center where PAX West takes place. It would be fun to return to Seattle and compare these locations to their counterparts in the game. :)</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230503091724_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230504084554_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>But while the scale is impressive, the length of game is somewhat troublesome. The first game never felt long or exhausting. Some parts took a while, but I never felt like it was taking forever. The Last of Us 2 shows the full breadth of the journey, from the very beginning to the very end and all parts in the middle. Sometimes it'll skip to where you need to do next, but you take the long way around every time.</p><p>Which, it's hard to fault the game for avoiding shortcuts, telling a complete story, and showing you the full journey. I think The Last of Us 2's biggest strength is its obsessive attention to detail and lack shortcuts in all aspects of the game. It's also its biggest weakness as it makes the game so long. Indulgent or Impressive?</p><p>I guess it's a matter of perspective and expectations, though. I knew what to expect from Last of Us 1 and went through it pretty quickly. I had no idea where this game was going to go.</p><p>It's also insane to me that I was able to buy it for a mere $10 when it feels like the most expensive game ever made. Looking online, apparently it has not come near to breaking even. Which.. given the amount of options people have for entertainment and how people immediately hated the game on its release, makes sense.  I suppose that's why Naughty Dog re-released Last of Us 1 and optioned for the TV Show.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the amount of detail, work, and care that went into The Last of Us 2, I think it's hard not to be impressed. I really didn't care much about the first game, but I think the TV show and the sequel really highlight the best parts of the story. I think The Last of Us is something quite special.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
