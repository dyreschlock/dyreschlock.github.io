| January 31, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After thinking about things quite a bit, I finally decided to buy a Japanese Nintendo 3DS XL.  One of the "New" ones, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were plenty pros and cons I've dealt with for a while.  For the record, the Nintendo 3DS is a region locked system, so I'm unable to play Japanese games on my American 3DS.  Likewise, I cannot play my American games on this one.  Nor, can I really exchange data of any kind between the two handhelds on a system level.  Though, nearly all games internally don't care about exchanging data.</p><div class='title'><b>The Cons</b></div><p>I had two big reasons that kept preventing me from outright buying this for a while.  One was the lack of games.  Any 3DS game I was interested in was almost guaranteed to make it to the U.S.  So I could simply wait, and buy it later.  The second reason was the language barrier.  Even if there were a game I wanted that didn't make it to the states, it would mostly likely be story-based or have mechanics where not totally understanding the language would get in my way.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>I continued to think more and more about that second point.  Everyday I deal with problems learning Japanese, and effectively communicating with those around me.  It weighs on me most days.  When I get home, I want to relax and just turn everything off in my head.  I usually do this by playing games, and I don't want to see anymore Japanese while I'm basically trying to get away from it.  Sometimes there's just too much being shoved into my brain at once.</p><p>Other foreigners living here face similar problems.  It continually builds and builds until you NEED to get out.  You need a break, a vacation.  Going back home over Christmas really let me recharge.  The same with visiting Okinawa last year.  I guess it's technically being "Home Sick" but it's not really that I want to go back home.  I just miss the variety, or the ability to actually understand people, and be effective in society.</p><p>Anyway, I just got back from vacation, so I've been recharged.  And many of my recent clashes with Japanese have turned out somewhat successful.  I'm using Google Translate FAR LESS on webpages these days.  When talking with other teachers, I rarely need to pull out my dictionary.  And with the Japanese I'm studying, I'm able to consistently read things and only misunderstand a few vocabulary words.</p><p>I am improving and am getting better, even though I'm still terrible at it.  So, the thought of having to tackle Japanese in games, and for fun, no longer seemed like con.  Really, it was now a reason <b>for</b> buying it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Pros</b></div><p>Having another venue for studying and practicing Japanese now joined my list of pros, which was really just a list of games I wanted to play.  These games include <b>Game Center CX 3</b>, <b>Yokai Watch</b>, the <b>Picross</b> games that haven't come to the U.S., and the eventually 3rd Gen VI <b>Pokemon</b> game, whether it be Pokemon Z or Pokemon Delta Emerald.</p><p><b>Yokai Watch</b> is massive in Japan right now, and I have no idea (really) what it is.  I've read some articles about people explaining it.  I've read the wikipedia page about it.  And read a few other things, too.  From what I gather, it's a multi-media marketing machine similar to Pokemon.  Eventually, the whole thing boils down to the core video game, and a complementary anime.  Really underneath all the bullshit Pokemon has, it's a solid game, and people claim Yokai Watch is, too.</p><p>So, people think Yokai Watch is actually good, and I want to know more about it.  It is coming to the U.S. this year, but I want to learn about it now, and also attempt to do it in Japanese.</p><p>Also, another reason I wanted to buy it is that I actually want an upgraded 3DS.  I play my Nintendo 3DS a lot, and the updated hardware has a lot of great stuff.  The Circle Pad pro is built into it.  It has a faster processor.  The 3D is better.  It's a great update.</p><p>So, I bought it. :D  Here it is:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" /></a><br/><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>I took a couple photos comparing the new 3DS XL to the previous 3DS XL, plus my DSi and DS Lite, since I have those.  The 3DS game goes in the bottom now, which is kinda weird.  Same with the stylus, which I don't like, but whatever.  Additionally, you need to unscrew and remove the back faceplate to get to the SD card slot.  It's annoying, but really only needed to be done once ever.  It uses a Micro SD card now, as well.</p><p>But it feels great.  The D pad feels amazing.  The buttons feel amazing.  I haven't used the right Circle pad much yet.  There's almost no tactile feedback with that at all from what I've messed with.  In game, I'm sure it's much better.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>Also, language-wise, it has been very gratifying and confidence building how I've been able to go through menus, sign up for things, and generally understand everything that I've been doing.  The language has not once gotten in my way.</p><p>I have yet to delve into Yokai Watch, but <b>Game Center CX 3</b> is excellent so far.  And, again, I've been able to understand what has been going on in the game.  I know what the characters are talking about.  In some cases, I understand the conversations completely.  The language has not been a crutch, what-so-ever.</p><p>Though, everything is still quite within my wheel house.  I already understand the menus, and Game Center CX from using and playing the English language equivalent.  I have not done that with Yokai Watch, so that game should actually challenge my understanding of Japanese.</p><div class='title'><b>Club Nintendo Picross</b></div><p>On the digital side of things, I purchased nearly all the Picross games available on the eShop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" /></a></p><p>With my current catalogue of Japanese 3DS games I had exactly enough points to purchase Club Nintendo Picross.  Game Center CX gave me 30 points.  Yokai Watch gave me 20.  And each of the 6 Picross E games were 5 points each.  80 points exactly!</p><p>It's really odd that this game using the Picross DS "engine", rather than the upgraded Picross E.  Overall there's like 180 puzzles in the game, including 2 Mega Picross puzzles.  I wanted to make sure I was able to get this game before Club Nintendo shut down for good in the next few months.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to get Club Nintendo Picross Plus, which was a Platinum reward last year, but I'll take what I can get.</p><p>For the <b>Picross E</b> games, only the first 3 made it to the U.S.  There are 3 more that came out in Japan just this past year.  Picross e6 just came out last month.  In addition, there's a second Picross Gameboy Virtual Console game only in Japan.  Whee, Picross!</p><div class='title'><b>Plenty to do</b></div><p>Well now I have plenty of new games to play, and also can actually take part in more Japanese games.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-end-2014-additions">Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 3, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Another year comes to close, and it has been another lucrative year for the team at Cards Against Humanity.  They've released quite a bit of new content.  At <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">PAX East</a>, they released a few new booster packs.  At PAX Prime, they released their fifth expansion.  And with Christmas passed, their new holiday expansion is now complete, too.</p><p>I'm back in the states for Christmas, and I'm able to catch up with the recent (and one not-so-recent) expansions of the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Reject Pack</b></div><p>The Reject Pack is an illusive booster pack of cards featuring some of the cut ideas for the original release of the game.  Not too long after the original release of the game, they began giving these out at various events, and giving them out as they fixed printing mistakes in their games.  They've never officially sold them, or even acknowledged their existence.</p><p>As I mentioned in that PAX East post, some company on amazon listed Reject Packs for $10.  Whether they were bootleg or not, that is absolutely the cheapest I have ever seen them offered online.  I quickly bought one, and this is the result:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The cards look pretty damn good.  The card titles match what has been posted online.  I can't really say if the portraits and the reject icon are correct, but they're close enough for me.  </p><p>The card quality seems slightly cheaper than the cards offered in the fifth expansion, but the cards have the correct pressing texture.  Perhaps the quality is slightly lower because these were printed alongside the first versions of the game before the company was highly profitable?</p><p>I can't really say whether these are fake one way or the other.  They didn't come from CAH official, but there are no obvious flaws.  For me, though, they are certainly good enough to cross off my check-list. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Official Fifth Expansion & Crabs Fourth Expansion</b></div><p>More and more cards.  During PAX Prime, they officially released their fifth expansion.  A month later, Crabs released their fourth expansion.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between these two expansions, you can observe the gap of humor between the official card writers at CAH, and the Crabs writers.  SO many of the Crabs cards are specific references.  Those kind of references you might find in an episode of Family Guy.  As if those kind of references are jokes in of themselves.  "Ze Germans"?  Oh yeah, I remember that from Snatch.  "www.clownpenis.fart"?  A reference to a hilarious SNL sketch, but not funny on its own.  The very last card in the expansion is a reference to Robin William's death..  </p><p>Many of the CAH cards don't really go into specifics.  They allow the audience and the players to make those connections on their own.  Really, that's the core of the humor in Cards Against Humanity.  These Crabs cards really miss the point.  They've really always missed the point.</p><div class='title'><b>10 Days (or whatever) of Kwanza</b></div><p>They did another holiday promotion in which CAH sent out several daily letters containing various things.  Each envelope detailed the story of Santa's death, and the great lizard uprising of 2352.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This year, there were a total of 11 envelopes.  The final present last year was a single white card with the recipients name on it.  This year, they got the individual cards out of the way immediately on the first day.  There was one white card, and one black card.  The second day contained magnetic stickers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The third, fourth, and fifth days contained the official 2014 holiday cards.

I mentioned some of those in the previous <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">post</a>, but I'll reiterate.</p><p><b>PAX Panel Packs</b> are 2 sets of 10 cards offered only to attendees of the panels at PAX East 2014 and PAX Prime 2014.  During the panel, audience members offer suggestions for cards and the best 10 cards are printed overnight, and given the audience members the next day.</p><p><b>House of Cards Against Humanity Pack</b> was a promotional item offered by Netflix for the release of House of Cards season two, which happened in February 2014.  Netflix asked CAH to make some cards, and they created 25 cards: 9 black, 16 white.  100,000 of these packs were offered for free online, and sold out within 45 minutes after Netflix tweeted about it.</p><p><b>The Science Pack</b> is another promotional item put together by CAH for the Bay Area Science Festival.  They have mentioned this will be offered online sometime in 2015.  There are 18 cards: 6 black, 12 white.</p><p><b>The TableTop Pack</b> is a promotion for the indie web show Table Top, starring Wil Wheaton, apparently.  To fund season three they setup something on IndieGoGo, and CAH offered a pack of cards for the $20 mark.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>In addition to the above expansions, I also bought a second bigger, blacker box to house my growing collection.  As mentioned before, several cards in the original sets were designed to work well with each other, but with so many expansions and unofficial expansions, those connections are lost and diluted.  There are a lot of great cards added in the expansions, but I think there are more useless ones.  I need to pair down my collection and make a great solid set of cards.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's my current collection.  For now, I separated all the cards into 3 different stacks: original cards, official expansion cards, and the unofficial expansion cards.  I think that's the best way for quality control for the time being.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity PAX East Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">Cards Against Humanity PAX East Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 28, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, I just received most of the latest additions to Cards Against Humanity.  Some of these came out of PAX East, and the others followed a month or two afterward.  The updates include the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" /></p><p>2012 Holiday Pack<br/>2013 Holiday Pack<br/>90s Nostalgia Pack<br/>Pwnmeal 2014 PAX East Cards<br/>Crabs Adjust Humidity vol. 3</p><p>The 90s packs were available at PAX East, but are now available for everyone on the Cards Against Humanity website, along with the 2012 and 2013 Holiday Packs.  The Crabs vol. 3 set can be purchased from the Vampire Squid website along with the previous volumes.  The Pwnmeal cards on the other hand…</p><div class='title'><b>PWNMeal</b></div><p>With the recent explosion of food products advertised to gamers as "Extreme Gamer Fuel," Max Tempkin, the co-creator of Cards Against Humanity, and current boss, had a twitter conversation about its ridiculousness with his friends.  This turned into a back-and-forth about dumb names for foods they haven't come up with yet.  When the topic of extreme oatmeal was introduced, Max had an idea that he could not stop himself from completing.</p><p>On April 12th, at PAX East in Boston, Max unveiled PWNMeal at the Giant Bomb Panel.</p><p><br/>Cards Against Humanity created 150,000 package of PWNMeal, and gave them out to as many people as they could at PAX East.  Each PAX East swag bag included one pouch of PWNMeal.  </p><p>There are 4 different flavors of PWNMeal: Strawberries and Carnage, No Scope Headshot Blueberry, MOBAnana Bread, and Cinnamon K/D Ratioatmeal.  And they were complete with a prize inside!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" /></p><p>Each PWNMeal package contains 10 cards for Cards Against Humanity: 8 white cards, and 2 black cards, of which there are a total of 27 different cards.</p><p>I bought a few packages from eBay after PAX East had finished.  I think I paid about $10 for each package.</p><p>Here's the distribution of cards I received from the 5 packs:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" /></p><p>I'm still missing 4 cards: #12, #17, #22, and #25.  Unlike the PAX Prime 2013 cards, these seem pretty evenly distributed.  Seems like the first 10 are common.  The second 10 are slightly less common, but not too bad.  I think I just got unlucky with the black cards.</p><p>There are still some unfunny PAX memes and inside jokes, but for the most part, these cards aren't too bad.  There are some good additions. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Expansions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" /></p><p>With these new additions, I own the following official expansions:</p><p>An original set of Cards Against Humanity (I'm not sure which version)<br/>The First, Second, Third, and Fourth (Official) Expansions<br/>The Holiday 2012, Holiday 2013, Box, and 90s Nostalgia Packs<br/>The PAX East 2013, PAX Prime 2013, and PAX East 2014 PWNMeal Packs</p><p>And the following unofficial expansions:</p><p>The UK Expansion (Bootleg - read about it here: <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions" title="/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions">February 10th, 2014</a>)<br/>and.. Crabs Adjust Humidity volumes One, Two, and Three.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" /></p><p>Now, my Bigger Blacker Box is 100% full.  That expansion box holds all of my blank cards.  I think I'm going to need to buy a second box to store some cards.</p><div class='title'><b>Missing</b></div><p>There are still 4 official release from Cards Against Humanity that I'm missing:  The Canada Conversion Set, the Reject Pack, the House of Cards pack, and the PAX East 2014 Panel Packs.</p><p><b>Canada Conversion Set</b> is a small set of cards included with the Canadian version of the game.  Rather than create a completely separate Canadian version of the game, the creators simply released the same version of the game for Canada, but added a small pack of localized cards that were Canada specific.  I don't think these cards are marked in anyway.  Plus they're Canada specific, so they aren't that funny to me.  It's not really worth it for me to buy it.</p><p><b>The Reject Pack</b> is a small package of several cards rejected from the original release of the game.  Each card was selected by one of the creators of the game, and features a drawing of their portrait at the bottom of the card.  These packs were given away at fan events.  Sometimes they were given to people with corrected orders.  They show up on eBay every now and then, but sell for $100.</p><p><i>Update</i>: Actually, some retailers are selling these on amazon for $10.  I bought two packs from one of the sellers. It's possible that they're bootleg, though.</p><p><b>House of Cards Pack</b> was something I totally and completely missed.  Netflix and Cards joined together and released a pack of cards based of the House of Cards television program available on Netflix.  This happened in January (or February) this year.  There are some on eBay, but sell for $60.</p><p><b>PAX East 2014 Panel Packs</b>:  In addition to the PWNMeal cards at PAX East, the creators of Cards Against Humanity performed another crazy feat of marketing.  They held a panel on Saturday, and during the panel the audience suggested cards to the panelists.  The top 10 cards were compiled, and sent to a print-shop.  They were completed overnight, and handed out to the attendees the following day.  Around 200 of these cards were made, and only given to those who attended the panel.</p><div class='title'><b>Quality over Quantity</b></div><p>As they say, with so many cards, it can difficult to have some quality sessions of Cards Against Humanity.  Some of those Crabs cards just aren't funny, and don't really work in most situations.  The next time I get a chance to play with friends, I'm going to start separating the shitty useless cards into a separate pile.  Hence the need for a second black box. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tomodachi Life - Fashion Catalog" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tomodachi-life-fashion-catalog">Tomodachi Life - Fashion Catalog</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 16, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, Nintendo released <b>Tomodachi Life</b> on the Nintendo 3DS in the US.  It's a life simulation game which you create, or import Miis on your island, and they all live together, make friends with each other, marry each other, and have children. :)  Also, you give your Mii presents, and feed them, which makes their happiness meter go up.  They gain levels this way.  Each new level awards them with a special gift, either a catch phrase, a song, or some kind of permanent present.</p><p>The entertainment of the game is creating a bunch of Miis of your friends, or celebrities, and having them all interact with each other.</p><p>For example, the female Matt Rorey (of Giant Bomb) had feelings for Batman, so she confessed her love.  But then Samus broke in and confessed her love.  Batman chose Samus, and eventually they got married.  Matt Rorey eventually got over Batman when Shaq O'Neil confessed his love for her.  A few days later Matt Rorey asked Shaq for marriage, and he said yes. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Here's some of the Miis at their wedding.  There's Jesse Pinkman, me, Miyamoto, Tyrion Lannister, Alex Nevarro (of Giant Bomb), Batman, Weird Al, and Mr. Bean.</p><div class='title'><b>QR Codes</b></div><p>A really nice feature of Tomodachi Life is being able to share your Mii across the Internet using a QR Code.  Through the menus in the game, you can generate a code for yourself, and others can import you in their game.  It only imports my likeness, and settings.  I can't actually interact with anyone.  But the Miis basically just do whatever they want anyway.</p><p>Here's my Mii, if you'd like me in your game:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Additionally, Nintendo has created some special Miis based on celebrities you can import into your game with custom backgrounds, and clothes.  There's Christina Aguilera, Shaquille O'Neal, Debby Ryan, Shaun White, and Zendaya.  You can find those codes <a href="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/" title="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/">here</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japanese Special Miis</b></div><p>It's been over a year since its release in Japan.  I figured that they did something similar with the Japanese release.  It took me a while to find any official Miis for the game, but eventually I found <a href="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html" title="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html">this website</a>.</p><p>A few months after the Japanese release in April 2013, Club Nintendo released a book called <b>Tomodachi Collection - Fashion Catalog</b>.  It's 88 pages of custom Miis showing off various clothing items you can collect in the game.  Here's the <a href="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html" title="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html">official page</a>.</p><p>Since I wanted a ton of Miis, I went through an imported each one.  They each have gold pants, too!  But, all of them have Japanese names, which my US game won't pronounce.  Since they're special, I can't edit them either.</p><p>Additionally, I have no idea who they are.  Are all these Miis based on Japanese celebrities?  Or are they athletes.  I don't know, so I'm gonna go through each one and write up my findings.</p><div class='title'><b>Findings</b></div><p>Well, it didn't take too long after searching for these characters to realize they're all made up.  </p><p>Unlike the celebrity Miis on Nintendo of America's website, these characters were specifically made up for this catalog.  Throughout the catalog, the Miis show off all these clothes.  Every clothing item in the catalog is attached to the Mii character, so when you import them into your game, you get all their items.  But, then you're stuck with this Mii.</p><p><b>None of this works in the US version of the game.</b>  When you import the Mii, you're given the stock Mii character and none of their items.  So, they're really pointless, unless you want to expand the Mii population of game quickly.  Also, since they're special, if you delete them, you cannot reimport them.  Maybe in the future, Nintendo will patch the game for these Miis to work.  But even so, I've already imported them, so I've already ruined that chance.</p><p>All in all, <b>there's very little use to actually importing these characters in your America game</b>.  But, here's all the codes if you want a bunch of gold panted Miis in your game:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><img

| February 10, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of my favorite games these days is Cards Against Humanity.  For those who don't know about this game, it started as a Kickstarter 3 years ago.  Some friends in Chicago came up with a game similar to Apples to Apples but with much more hilarious or horrible responses depending on your point of view.</p><p>To play, all players draw 10 white cards.  White cards are usually nouns, phrases, or whatever.  Someone is chosen as the card czar, and they draw a single black card.  The read the black card, which is either a fill-in-the-blank, or a question, and the other players use one of their white cards to complete the black card.  The card czar then chooses the "best" card, which can be on any criteria they wish be it appropriate, inappropriate, or just funny.  The player whose white card was chosen gets the black card, and the person with the most amount of black cards wins the game.</p><p>I first bought my copy of the game at Pax Prime 2012.  At that time, there were 2 official expansions.  SInce then, there's been quite a bit more.  All in all, there's the following add-ons:</p><p>First, Second, Third, and Fourth (Official) Expansions<br/>Holiday Expansion (Christmas 2012)<br/>12 Days of Holiday Bullshit (Christmas 2013)<br/>PAX East 2013 Promo Packs<br/>PAX Prime 2013 Promo Packs<br/>(The ever elusive) Reject Pack<br/>The Bigger, Blacker Box (which includes the Box Expansion)<br/>and.. Crabs Adjust Humidity Volumes One and Two (Fan expansion from one of the creators)</p><p>Again, I'm a huge fan of the game, so I have everything listed above EXCEPT for the <b>Reject Pack</b> which has never been sold, and may not even be in production anymore.  People have said they've gotten it from events in Chicago, and sometimes when they've had to order replacement cards.</p><p>Here's my collection from after PAX Prime 2013 after purchasing the Box and getting most of the PAX Prime cards</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" /></p><p>Since then, I've added the Fourth Expansion, the Christmas 2013 Cards, and Crabs Adjust Humidity Volume Two.  And now, I've added one more thing...</p><div class='title'><b>Localized Editions</b></div><p>In addition, Cards Against Humanity has released a version in Canada and the UK with localized cards.  The Canadian edition only has a few changes, so the box includes a base USA set with an extra box labeled the Canada Expansion.  This is not available on its own, and the only way to get it is through Amazon Canada which doesn't ship to the US.</p><p>The UK Edition released overseas is much more localized.  So much so that there is no little expansion included in the box, it's all mixed in.  Several of the base USA cards have been changed slightly to reflect the English dialect over American.  Several USA cards have been dropped, with UK specific cards added as replacements.  They've gone to great lengths to actually make a UK version of the game, rather than just tacking on a couple cards.</p><p>Much like the Canadian edition of the game, annoying collectors and completists, such as myself, want to add these cards to my deck, even though there's plenty of English idioms I either won't get, or think are as funny as the US counterpart.</p><p>I was searching around eBay for both these localized editions (and the Reject Pack), and I came across the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The UK Expansion</b></div><p>Some seller from the UK, had this listed on eBay.  The "UK Expansion" it reads, and looks all official.  At the time, I searched around the internets, but didn't really see anything about it.  Everything kept coming up UK <u>Edition</u>, not Expansion.  But still, I was really curious.  Well, it was only $20 shipped, and would go anywhere in the world.  Why not?  I'll buy it and have it shipped to my place in Japan.</p><p>and It arrived today!  So here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" /></p><p>Oh yeah?  This thing is counterfeit.  The outside of the box is set to look exactly like the other expansions.  Lots of care was taken in making this thing look official.  Right down to the little version number each official Edition and Expansion has printed on the box.</p><p>The biggest give away are the cards themselves.  While they are the correct font, correct size, and basically the correct weight, there's no linen finish on the cards that give them the "player card" texture and feel.  They're just straight matte card stock.  It makes them feel pretty flimsy and cheap.</p><p>You can see it pretty well in this photo:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" /></p><p>But, honestly, while the card quality themselves is a pretty big deal, it's the only fault of these cards.  Everything else is damn near perfect.  A user on the Boardgame Geek forum wrote up a review about these cards as well, and details all the cards included in this set.  Weirdly, the set is actually missing a few cards from the UK Edition of the game.  And then included some US cards from the 1.5 version of the base set.</p><p>http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1119851/review-of-the-not-official-125-card-uk-expansion</p><p>But, overall, not bad.  They're even labeled as UK expansion, so you can easily tell them apart from the normal cards.  Though, the card stock is a real easy way to do that without even needing to look.  With the addition of this set, my Bigger, Blacker Box is nearly full!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" /></p><p>The extra box in there contains all my empty custom cards.  If I completed all those, I don't think I could fit another expansion.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>There is a down side to having all these cards, though.  How many times have you been playing this game, and have totally unplayable cards?  It's happens very often.  I think with the base set and the expansions, there were actually thinking about how to expand the deck and have more playable cards.  Ones that actually cleverly work with the black cards, and create more plausible, cohesive combinations.</p><p>But with the PAX cards, the Christmas cards, and DEFINITELY the Crabs cards, so many of the white cards turn into dead ends, and the hilarious combinations get lost with all the noise.</p><p>I think the next times that I play with friends, I'm going to start culling some cards and get rid of the fluff.  Collecting and completing collections is fun, but there's still the game to play underneath.  The collection shouldn't get in the way of that.  My deck needs to be tighter.  :)</p><p>I think the box is a good bar for the amount of cards any person should have.  Anymore, and you continue to dilute the quality of the hands you'll draw.  Plus, it's not like you'll actually finish a game to completion.  With just the base set and two expansions, it took about 4 or 5 hours to play through all the cards.  And now my box has more than twice that!</p><p>Though, I will say, I think the more black cards the better.  I don't think there are really any terrible black cards.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyway?</b></div><p>So, anyway, that's the UK Expansion.  It is counterfeit, so take that into consideration if you're thinking of buying it.  I haven't had a chance to play any games with the new cards, but hopefully I won't need to wait too long.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Minecraft" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-minecraft">Lego Minecraft</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 15, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I finally received my very own set of Minecraft Legos, as well as a couple of stickers.  I think this is the first Lego product I've bought (or received) in the last 20 years.  Some might think the idea of Lego Minecraft is ironic.  Others might say this serves absolutely no purpose.  Some might say this was only a matter of time.  And others might say it's art imitating art.</p><p>Minecraft is a computer game developed by swedish person Markus Persson, where you can destroy any piece of the environment, pick that piece up, and place it where ever you want.  Many people describe this game as Legos in of itself, as you move around pieces, and build whatever you want.  That's the mining part of Minecraft.</p><p>The other part of Minecraft is the crafting.  You can take these pieces that you've mined and created new objects, and build more elaborate structures beyond what the environment has given you to begin with.  And you can do whatever you want.</p><p>Many people describe Minecraft is "playing with Legos." In fact, you could argue that Minecraft is the truest most best Lego video game ever created.  Lego has put its stamp on countless other games and all that them fail at the basic concept of what Lego is 'built' on...</p><p>So it IS deeply ironic that this concept has come full circle into the physical realm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Development</b></div><p>This set of Legos has been in development since November last year.  As you might have noticed above, the brand Lego Cuusoo is thrown around a little bit.  Cuusoo is an online development program where Lego creators bring their ideas to a vote.</p><p>Here's the original Cuusoo entry for Minecraft : <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038" title="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038">http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038</a></p><p>All Cuusoo ideas are submitted and put to a vote.  If the idea gets 10,000 supporters, it goes into a development phase where the creators must prove their idea.  Once they've come up with a physical build of the Lego product, it's put in front of a panel of judges, and they vote on whether or not the product actually comes to market.</p><p>Legos are WAAYYYY more serious these days then they were when I was a kid.  I mean, at heart, they are still a kid's toy, and they plenty of sets for children.  But they have advanced sets for the people who grew up with the toy, and enjoy the simple aesthetic.  And even beyond that, this Cuusoo system is there for the people who enjoy building something out of nothing: The architect.  These days the toy goes beyond an age range, and delves into the intellectual range.</p><p>It's awesome that there's this creative outlet for all Lego architects out there, but I've almost always been more interested in the building aspect of Legos.  I liked deviating from the instructions when I was a kid, but I never had the resources to build something from nothing.  These days you can visit any of the Legoland locations and buy any specific Lego piece you need.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Building</b></div><p>Building this thing was pretty fun.  I followed the instructions, and built everything 'correctly'.  Minecraft has always been about digging under the surface and finding all the hidden treasures.  Through building a scene of your own, you are doing the exact opposite.  You are placing all the hidden ore, and items in the environment and covering them up.  It's almost like you're acting like the scenery generator in the game itself.</p><p>There are gold blocks and diamond blocks that are very obviously placed, but there are other elements placed within the scene that are completely obscured when viewing the finished product.  In the end, the builder is the only one that knows they're there.  It's a secret.</p><p>There's also a Lego Steve, and a Lego Creeper available in the set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess it's kind of dumb.  Despite Legos' timeless and ageless construction, I feel like I've grown out of them.  I loved them as a kid, but the aesthetic just doesn't do anything for me anymore.  I get that the limited construction of the tool has pushed the creativity of its users well beyond what it was originally intended for, and built its own community, Cuusoo, based on that, but...  I just feel like I'm passed them.  I don't enjoy the aesthetic anymore.  It's too distinctive.</p><p>Once the Lego structure is built...  then what?  It just sits on display.</p><p>But... I do appreciate this Lego set.  <b>I find it as art imitating art.</b> There are clear choices made in its construction that imitate the game exactly.  A 1x1x2 block of Lego is equivalent to a block in Minecraft, and that is consistent throughout the entire model.  You can't really mine any of the pieces, but its construction and existence mirrors the game.</p><p>It's very well done, and representative of the game.  Much like the feeling of building a home, or any structure in Minecraft channels the fun you had with Legos as a kid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway...  I like it.  I feel like the abstract nature of Lego is a perfect physical representation of Minecraft.</p><div class='title'><b>Update : June 18th</b></div><p>As you may have noticed from one of the photos above, I had enough Legos to make an extra head for Steve.  I did not have enough pieces left over to make a body, though, so I saw this as a sign to complete one of those quirky life goals on my bucket list: <b>Go to Legoland to purchase a single Lego piece.</b></p><p>I was in Chicago this weekend, and the suburbs of Chicago have two Lego stores right next to each other.  There's the Lego Store in Woodfield Mall, and the Lego Discovery Center just outside.  Each store has a thing called 'Pick a Brick' where they have bins of multiple colors and sizes of Legos bricks, and you can fill up a bucket with all the pieces you want.  It's generally $10 for 10lbs (if I recall), and the selection is limited for each store.</p><p>The Lego Discovery Center has the exact sized block I needed, but only in Bright Orange.  I went inside the Woodfield Mall, and they didn't have any bricks of that size at all.  BUT!  The trip was still a success.  I was able to purchase my 1x1 brick and create a friend for Steve to play with.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards of Legend" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-of-legend">Cards of Legend</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A couple of weeks ago they listed a set of Legend of Zelda playing cards that looked rather pretty.  They were created by Internet user, Nelde.

| February 16, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Despite trying to hold off on watching media about this game, I decided to download the demo and play through it.<br/>___</p><p>Seems like the first area is the introduction to the entire game. I'm sure it's cut up a little bit to be paced well as a demo, but this is probably what we're going to see in the first an hour or two of the game. And then it's off to space to recruit people, or whatever. I think both Mass Effect 1 and 2 were paced pretty well. Mass Effect 1 gave a great introduction to the universe while sticking pretty close to a story. And Mass Effect 2 put the story on hold at multiple points in the game, and we were able to learn more about the rich universe.</p><p>I loved the universe building stuff, but if they're going add in a lot of that against the urgency of stopping the reaper threat, my belief won't be suspended for long. It's like spending 10+ hours (months in game) fishing in Legend of Zelda while the princess rots in a castle. "Eh, Earth can wait while I run off to the Hanar homeworld and learn about their culture." (Hopefully, we can go to the Hanar homeworld in ME3 ^_^)<br/>___</p><p>Also, one thing I found a bit annoying, and will certainly irk a lot of anal retentive Mass Effect fans is that they use the term "Ammo" is the game (demo) quite a bit. As if those things you pick up hold some amount of bullets to be fired by your gun. There is no ammunition used in the weapons of Mass Effect. All weapons fire plasma, or whatever, and those things you pick up are thermal clips. The shot counter on the side of the screen is how many shots you can fire before you burn out your gun, and finding additional thermal clips will allow you to fire more shots.</p><p>This point was brought up in the dissection of Mass Effect Deception found on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBpMF3ONlI308D9IGG8KICBHfWKU0sXh0ntukv-_cmo/preview?pli=1&sle=true" title="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBpMF3ONlI308D9IGG8KICBHfWKU0sXh0ntukv-_cmo/preview?pli=1&sle=true">Google Docs</a>.  Number 15 under oddities.  Did William Dietz have written credits for Mass Effect 3 as well?<br/>___</p><p>Another thing that annoyed me from the first part of the demo was at the end when those civilians and soldiers hop on board those shuttles only to be wiped out by the reaper landing right behind them. Why the hell didn't that thing shoot at the Normandy?! The Normandy was a way bigger target and hovering still in the air. And, I'm sure Harbinger told all the reapers about Shepard. Don't you think they'd be on the look out for that exact same ship? The same one that destroyed the collector base and was sought after multiple times in the previous game? Eh, maybe they were cloaked? Can the Normandy do that? Or maybe the blue paint job threw them off.<br/>___</p><p>Other than that, there was a lot more going on in the background and more interesting camera angles during dialogue scenes, so it felt more engaging than a simple flat profile shot. There was a lot more action oriented things going on, and now you can jump and climb ladders and what not. Heavy Melee attacks, too.</p><p>The second part of the demo felt more like actual Mass Effect, than the opening bit. I played this last year at PAX, and it has not changed since then. In this scene, you have Wrex, Garrus, and Liara meet up with Mordin, and you do story related things.</p><p>I REALLY want to see what this mission is like if you have Wrex and Mordin killed off from the previous games. Would you even have the opportunity to have this mission? Both characters seem rather integral in order to complete it, or even access it to begin with. Maybe you'd have Grunt instead of Wrex? What happens if you have everyone dead, except yourself. Do they just swap out NPCs instead of storyline charcters? Unfortunately selecting "Numerous Deaths" at the beginning of the demo when it asks you who died in the previous games still has Wrex, Garrus, and Mordin at this part of the demo.  :(</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect 2 results" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-2-results">Mass Effect 2 results</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 16, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past weekend I finished my second playthrough of Mass Effect 2 in anticipation of the upcoming release of Mass Effect 3.  After picking it up after leaving it for a year and half, I'm amazed at how engaging and rich the entire experience still is.  It's a fantastic game, and definitely my favorite new game to come out of this gaming generation.</p><p>My character has remained consistent throughout the events of Mass Effect 1 and 2.  My Shepard, Jane Shepard, has been a Paragon in most cases, and able to talk herself out of any problem.  She's also been incredibly thorough, completing all side missions, and collecting nearly everything spanned across the galaxy.  Well prepared and powerful.</p><div class='title'><b>Wish Fulfillment</b></div><p>Around the release of Mass Effect 2, Anthony Burch (of Destructoid fame, at the time) released two videos talking about decisions and possible decisions you can make in the game depending on how consistent and thorough you play it.  The videos are from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml">January 27th, 2010</a>, and <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml">February 3rd, 2010</a>.</p><p>I'm not that big a fan of that obnoxious website, but both these rants brought up the idea of Wish Fulfillment in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.  If you want something bad enough, you can have it!  You can have your cake and eat it, too.  If you want this character to live, you can play the game to the point where they will live.  Want all characters to live?  You can do that too!</p><p>There was one point where you had to make a decisions between two team mates, and one or the other was going to die.  It's the only scene between the two games where you can't have your cake and eat it, too.  It wasn't really a tough decision for me, though, because I didn't really like either character.  And so far, the consequence has been nothing but a palette swap.</p><p>But in Mass Effect 2, you can get on everyone's good side, and have everyone be happy with each other, despite the natural conflicts between some of the characters.  As Anthony mentions in the second video, when characters are fighting and it makes you choose, it should actually make you choose one over the other, rather than choosing some dialogue where both are still your friends.</p><div class='title'><b>Consequence</b></div><p>The idea of Wish Fulfillment dances around the fact that actions have consequence, and we aren't seeing any of these consequences.  That's what Mass Effect's continued Save File persistence throughout the series is supposed to represent.  If you make a decision in a prior game, those decisions come back to bite you in the ass.</p><p>Mass Effect 2 didn't penalize you for making decisions in the first game.  The overall story of ME2 didn't change.  The only thing that changed were certain dialogue choices, and some random people from the first game may make an appearance.  Here's the list of all choices in Mass Effect 1 that had bearing in Mass Effect 2: <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer" title="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer">Save FIle Transfer on Mass Effect Wikia</a>.</p><p>Mass Effect 3 needs to have these consequences finally come to life.  They say they're going to, but they actually have to do it.  And not only that, but make some of your "good" paragon decisions thrown back in your face.  The Paragon/Renegade system isn't about Good v. Evil, it's about Nice v. Mean.  So far you could be either, and it didn't matter.  There needs to be a clear distinction that a Paragon choice you made in the past was wrong, rather than (possibly) making all the Renegade choices wrong.</p><p>Entire areas of the game need to be inaccessible depending on the choices you've previously made.  Certain quest lines should only be available based on your decisions.  And even certain allies in the past, should now become enemies because of something you did.  Mass Effect 3 should be a radically different experience for those who have played through the previous games, rather than just a different character saying different things in place of another character.</p><div class='title'><b>Romance</b></div><p>Romance has been a big part of Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 3 is (supposedly) when all your choices come to fruition.  As male or female Shepard you have 2 choices on who you can get involved with in Mass Effect 1.  In Mass Effect 2, you have 3 choices for either gender, and neither of these choices are the same from the first game.  In ME2, you can cheat on your lover from the first game.</p><p>Well, that's what I did on my first playthrough.  As Female Shepard, I definitely went for Liara, the blue female alien, and then I cheated on her.  I think it was more for curiosity sake if anything because a romance between Female Shepard and Garrus was completely ridiculous.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons I wanted (or needed) to play Mass Effect 2 a second time through was because Liara had a prominent role in a DLC mission, and I wanted to make things right.  The Shadow Broker DLC pack allowed our relationship to continue in Mass Effect 2 in a cute scene aboard the Normandy.</p><div class='title'><b>Alternate Lovers</b></div><p>Outside of those 3 romantic choices in Mass Effect 2, there are 3 (or 4) other instances where you can get physical with other characters.  One of these can only happen if you're male Shepard, and it's with Jack during some random conversation.  The other 2 options are with Samara and Kelly Chambers, both of which I did in addition to Liara in my game.  Like all romances, the more you talk with the character, the more you bond, and the eventual romantic options start to crop up.</p><p>With Kelly, keep talking with her after missions, and eventually you will have the option to invite her up to your quarters for dinner.  This is also beneficial because she was automatically feed your fish for you.  After you complete the final mission, and both of you are alive, talk with her again.  She'll send you an email after the conversation about some private time in your quarters.  Go up to your quarters, and invite her up using the comm system on your desk.</p><p>With Samara, if you continue talking with her after missions, the final step is when she starts to ask about how you feel about her.  You can say "just friends" or "something more" or something like that.  Steer the conversation towards trying to seduce her.  She'll ultimately reject you, but leave her quarters.  You'll find her in the crew quarters next door looking out the window at the FTL drive.  If you talk with her, her response is simply, "Please?"</p><p>I guess there's a fourth alternate romance option, and that's with Morinth.  You can talk her into having sex with you, but this kills you instantly because she's an Adart-Yakshi.  This romance cannot persist because it's Game Over.</p><p>Anyway, after continuing my romance with Liara, then going after Samara, and getting physical with Kelly, the photo of Liara is still standing in Shepard's private quarters.  This photo (on your desk) is your romance from the first game, and if this is tipped over, that means you've cheated.  So, despite sort of cheating on Liara this time, the game doesn't think I've cheated.</p><p>Hopefully this will come back at me in the next game, or at least be touched upon.  If anything, I can say that I've done every possible lesbian relationship on a single save.  High Five.</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect 3</b></div><p>Mass Effect 3 is a mere 3 weeks away!  I'm excited.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Batman Arkham City Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/batman-arkham-city-thoughts">Batman Arkham City Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 31, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I ran through Arkham City and smashed up the place.  </p><p>It's Okay.</p><p>I guess you could say I was disapointed, but that really comes down to expectations.  I'm definitely a fan of the first game, Arkham Aslyum.  It was surprising, and fantastic, and felt like it came out of no where.  Again...  expectations.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham Asylum</b></div><p>I'm not sure if anyone was expecting something great when they first tried out Arkham Asylum, but I always kept reality in check.  There had never really been a <i>Good</i> game made from a comic book IP.  At least, not a mainstream game.  These type of games are usually just IP fodder.  Some random company is contracted for a Batman game, or a Superman game, or a Spiderman game.  They shit it out, and make money on the name recognition.  Kids buy these games in droves!</p><p>But Arkham Asylum was totally different.  It was a true to form modern Metroidvania style game.  The world you explored was small, tight, and as you progressed through the game, the new abilities and techniques you acquired help you access areas you hadn't previously had access to.  Though, power ups were unlocked through story progression, instead of exploration.  There were many secrets that required some backtracking and using your new gadgets.</p><p>All the gadgets and weapons made sense for the character of Batman, and in the context of exploring and getting to new areas.  It worked perfectly.</p><p>The story was kinda kooky, but made sense given the ridiculous nature of most comic book stories.  It wasn't necessarily trying to be realistic.  </p><p>The villains and their motivations were what brought everything together.  What happens when you get all of your enemies together in one place?  Some form an alliance, some are enemies to each other, some you stay away from, and some just pop when it's the most convenient for them.  Arkham Asylum was incredibly consistent with how the villains would react to each other, and to Batman as he infiltrated the compound.</p><p>There were plenty of interesting set pieces as well.  Like Scarecrow warping Batman's mind, or Joker capturing Batman is recreating the opening credits, but with the roles reversed.</p><p>My expectations were always reserved though, so whenever something amazing happened, I was surprised and delighted.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham City</b></div><p>I think for Arkham City, I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and then nothing really did.  It really is just more of the same.</p><p>The story is still okay.  The gadgets are pretty much the same.  Combat is more fluid and fun.  There are 400 Riddler trophies now, instead of 100 in the first game.</p><p>The overworld is about 4 times the size of Arkham Asylum, but it feels really small.  You can only enter just a hand full of buildings.  And when you're in the city, you're usually just gliding from one building to the next.  You aren't really doing anything interesting expect looking for Riddler trophies, or hunting down some random thing for a side quest.  This basically makes Arkham City more like a GTA or Infamous, rather than Arkham Asylum which felt more like Metroid or Zelda.</p><p>There are more villains this time, but it follows the same scheme as the first game.  The heavy hitters are vie for territory in the city, and act appropriately to each other.  Sometimes you are randomly ambushed by those villains who prefer to work alone.  And others form alliances, and blackmail each other.  Not every villain is an actual villain though, which was a nice touch.</p><p>Overall, Arkham City is pretty good and it's fun, but...  it's not really doing anything new.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
