| October 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, i finally finished up with Halo 3.  I beat it on Heroic (the true difficulty setting), and proceeded to get my ass kicked in Legendary.  I found all the skulls and accessed all the terminals, so aside from a few other achievements online, I think I'm probably at my limit for the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>In order to truly appreciate Halo 3, you should really play through Heroic.  Normal is just way too easy to be taken seriously.  In Heroic, you get a true sense of the enemies actually being strategic when defending or attacking.  The brutes will always send in a little grunt to smoke you out.  They'll chuck grenades down the hall at you and try to cut off escape routes.</p><p>In Normal, you can easily mow down any enemies that stand in your way..  It's really no challenge.  Lately it seems like Normal difficult is the new Easy difficult.  When a casual gamer picks up a game, he doesn't want to play on easy just because he sucks..  He wants Normal just like the big boys.  Developers have been continually dumbing down difficulty levels to the point where the true experience is Hard mode.  The same was with Metroid Prime 3.  Games are getting too easy.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. Legendary difficulty is simply balls out difficult.  I gave up after consistently dying during the first few skirmishes in the jungle.  Penny Arcade was SPOT ON when they said Legendary on Halo 3 is a chore.  There were a few spots in Heroic that were challenging and took me a while, but they weren't difficult.  Heroic was that bowl of porrage that was just the right temperature.  Normal is too cold, and Legendary is too hot.</p><div class='title'><b>Environments</b></div><p>Isn't it rather strange that all the "alien" worlds look exactly like Earth?  True, when you're on a halo you can see the ring continue up into the atmosphere and when you're on the ark, you can see the rims in the distance..  But the actual environments you walk on...  there's nothing alien about them at all.  Why does the ark look exactly like someplace on earth?  Why can't their be bizzare plant-life?  Why don't we ever see indigenous animal life too?</p><p>Metroid Prime 3 has some imaginative places to explore..  Why does something as sacrade as the Ark and a Halo ring look normal?  Maybe that's something I'm missing in the story..</p><p>Also, there really wasn't any epic battle fought on earth the way it was fought in Halo 2.  The second level of Halo 2 had you fighting your way to one of earth's major cities.  In the distance, you could actually see the city and the havoc taking place.  As you fought your way toward it, it would grow on the horizon until you eventually arrived inside that city you had seen from the beginning of the battle.  Then you waged war on the streets and in alleyways.</p><p>In Halo 3, there's nothing like that at all.  The locations you fight on Earth, look like burnt out Army bases and bunkers.  You never fight in a true residential area..  and because of that you never get that emotion attachment to your surrounding to actually feel like Earth is actually in peril.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. The environments are varied throughout the game, so it's not the same level over and over again.  There's the jungle, an underground bunker, a desert base, base of a mountain, snowy hills, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Honestly, I don't think the story of Halo 3 is all that bad.  It's like a fun action movie where you play the unbeatable action hero.  Unfortunately, they really didn't do much with the backstory of the first two games.  I guess Bungie was assuming that if you're playing Halo 3, then you probably played through Halo 1 and 2 and remember the story verbatum.</p><p>Well, even though I have played through Halo 1 and 2, that was so long ago, I hardly even remember it.  I remember a little bit of Halo 2's cop out ending, but I really have no idea what the convenant actually is, nor the real importance of the Halo rings, nor most other stuff.</p><p>Apparently, the extra disc in the limited edition has all the cutscenes from Halo 1 and 2 remastered and cut together for people to catch up on the story..  So, I should really check that out.  I would REALLY like it if Bungie (or whomever these days) would remake the campaign missions Halo 1 and 2 using the Halo 3 engine.  I would love to go through them again and not have to put up with dated graphics and no achievements.  I suppose if Microsoft did that, each set of campaign missions would be $30 :/</p><p>Anyways, I thought the ending for the Halo series worked pretty well.  It put a lid on Halo..  hopefully when the do make a Halo 4, it'll be called something more appropriate.</p><div class='title'><b>More?</b></div><p>What more is there to say about Halo really?  I'm horribly at multiplayer and I really was playing it more for the story.  Though now that 2 of my close friends picked up 360s with Halo 3, I might be online a little more messing around with forge or multiplayer..  but I think I've hit my limit for regular multiplayer.  I really don't get that much enjoyment out of running around killing a bunch of people I don't really know to ascend the ranks and fight people that I can't really compete against.  Plus, there's other games to play ^_^</p><p>Halo 3 is a great social game, though.. so if you got a couple friends with a copy, getting yourself a copy isn't such a bad idea.  There's more than just Slayer matches.</p><p>I guess that's really all I have to say about Halo 3.  :shrugs</p><p><em>Related Posts</em><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-biting-the-bullet" title="/halo-3-biting-the-bullet">Halo 3: Biting the bullet</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-midnight-release" title="/halo-3-midnight-release">Halo 3 Midnight Release</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-initial-impressions" title="/halo-3-initial-impressions">Halo 3 Initial Impressions</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset" title="/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset">Halo 3 Wireless Headset</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PSP: Parappa v.

| September 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At the end of time and space, the Playstation is certainly known for the creation and flourishment of Rhythm games. All of Konami's Bemania games starting up with the Playstation hardware in mind, and other niche little title began to sprout up. Games like Parappa, Vib Ribbon, Gitaroo Man, Guitar Hero, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and so forth. Even Sega's UGA branch found an excellent home for Rez and Space Channel 5.</p><p>This is probably my favorite genre in gaming because the idea of using music to fuse all parts of your experience together paints a glorious feeling. Its the only way to push your emotions to the absolute limits and tune everything else out. Honestly, I feel that music is the ultimate expression of yourself and being able to convey that message is pure nirvana.</p><p>Being able to experience other's feelings and thoughts is truly amazing. Other games like Fzero GX and Wipeout also convey this message through their amazing soundtrack.</p><p>But anyways, I spent a good chunk of my morning with my PSP which has really been the center of rhythm based games lately. As the title suggests, I played some Parappa and Gitaroo Man.</p><div class='title'><b>Parappa the Rappa</b></div><p>Parappa is one of the key soundtracks to the Playstation One's life. A month after its release, everyone was singing the songs together outside of the game. Even to this day, it's an amazing feeling to be in an elevator with one of the songs in your head and you accidentally mudder part of the song to yourself and then another elevator inhabitant sings it along with you ^_^</p><p>Back in reality, though.. Parappa the Rappa is about Parappa. A little dog kid who's trying to get the girl, but just needs confidence. Through 8 stages, you help Parappa rap to the confidence he needs to stand up to bullies, drive a car, bake a cake, make money, and so forth. Parappa's catch-line is "I gotta Believe". It's very cute and teaches kids to be confident in themselves and your dreams will come true ^_^</p><p>The game is pure excellence except for one very large unavoidable train wreck in basic gameplay that will stop this game in it's tracks.</p><div class='title'><b>The Timing</b></div><p>The quintessential element to every Rhythm game is so absolutely broken in Parappa, I don't think I'll be able to play the game again. Each level you have a partner you rap with and you simply copy their moves directly. There's a little time bar going across the top showing the buttons you need to press to go along with the song.</p><p>Except when you do exactly identical to the other person, you lose. You try to keep time with the time-line, you lose. I have no idea when I'm supposed to hit the button. It doesn't make any sense at all. And then when I go through a line and think that I completely biffed it, it works just fine! It sounds like crap but the game accepts it! What the hell!</p><div class='title'><b>Game Design Flaw</b></div><p>There's one other piece of game design that absolutely screws you over every single time, as well. In order to defeat a level, you have certain grading levels throughout the song. Cool, Good, Bad, and Awful. When you screw up a line, it'll flash the level below you indicating that if you mess up again, you'll go down a level. This continues until you screw up twice in a row on Awful. In order to pass a song, you must complete it in the Good and Cool status.</p><p>SO.. that means, regardless how you've done the entire song, if you screw up the last two songs.. YOU LOSE and you must begin the entire song again. The entire song can be easy as shit, but if the last two lines of the step chart are unique or really tough, you're screwed for passing the song. It's not possible, just give up. You can believe in yourself all you want, but the game hates you.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict on Parappa</b></div><p>So screw Parappa.. I love the game a lot, and I don't remember the timing being so horribly broken. I mean, I beat the original back in the day.. somehow. I even remember getting Cool on the last level. When that occurs you simply freestyle by yourself with no grading and I had no idea how to do it.</p><p>Parappa had two sequels.. kinda. Um Jammer Lammy was a spiritual sequel with a guitar playing Lamb, and then the PS2 saw Parappa 2. I tried Um Jammer Lammy, but I absolutely hated it. Parappa was all about learning the songs you could sing to.. you can't do that with guitar :/</p><div class='title'><b>Gitaroo Man</b></div><p>Speaking of Guitars, Koei released this absolute gem on the Playstation 2 in between releases of Dynasty Warriors. It met with such bad sales over here, that it became instantly rare. When I finally learned of the game, copies were going for $80 on eBay. I thought all was lost, but Koei did us all a favor and re-released it. I snatched it up for $35 Used at Gamestop without a problem.</p><p>Gitaroo Man focuses on child U-1 and his life problems.. He loves this girl, but gets pushed around by bullies, does mediocre in school, and really has absolutely no talent. Little does he know, that he's actually the legendary Gitaroo Man and holds the power to rid the universe of the evil Gitaroos if he would only believe in himself and unlock his power.</p><p>The main premise is very similar to Parappa, except Gitaroo fights his opponents rather than learns from them.</p><p>When faced against opponents, U-1 grabs his Gitaroo and transforms into Gitaroo man.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Gitaroo plays very wickedly. It does have a time-line, but it winds around the screen and you're to connect to it by pushing in the same direction. Notes come down the pipeline, and you hit and hold the O button to play them. You're always using one button when playing the song, but the time-line winds around the screen so much, it is still very interesting.</p><p>But that's not all. You're in a battle, and your opponent will fire attacks at you the same way. To dodge these attacks, you use the rest of the face buttons as the notes center mid-screen. It gets a little annoying because of trying to judge the correct order of button presses, but it's more challenging than difficult.</p><p>The timing is spot on.. You hit the button when the note hits the center of the screen. What a concept! How the hell can Parappa gets this so absolutely wrong?!.. ugh, whatever.</p><div class='title'><b>Innovation</b></div><p>With these two modes of play, Koei really mixes up the rotation. The main mode of gameplay is Charge (to regain health), Attack (which will deplete your health if you miss notes), and Finish (which is all attack, but you lose health if you miss notes). The first 5 or 6 levels are exactly like this, but Koei throws a little curve ball at you. One level you are running away from a space shark, which involves dodging the entire match. Just make it to the end!</p><p>My favorite level in the game is one where U-1 doesn't even transform into Gitaroo man, he doesn't even play his Gitaroo. With his recent battles, he's actually gotten pretty good at acoustic and plays a serenading song to ease the soul ^_^. Later on in the game, this serenade becomes your theme song, and you rock as Gitaroo Man to win over the hearts and souls of an entire planet. It's quite moving ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict on Gitaroo Man</b></div><p>Koei sets up its gameplay, but doesn't rigidly stick to it either.. They play around with it and compose an excellent game. The sound fills you with compassion and you become U-1 and battle the evil Gitaroos for control of their Gitaroo.</p><p>I fully recommend this game, and if you own a PSP, you must own it. Definitely pick it up before it becomes rare again.. I picked up my copy a few weekends ago at Gamestop for $18.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Versions</b></div><p>Unfortunately, the PSP version of Gitaroo is exactly identical. They didn't add any remixes or new levels, which is an absolute downer.</p><p>Parappa actually defeats Gitaroo Man in the category. You can go on the PSN with Parappa and download new remixes of all the stages, but that's really it. They should have included Parappa 2 in this PSP game, and maybe even Um Jammer Lammy. It would've been excellent to have the Parappa trilogy all in one pack. Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>Length and Replay value</b></div><p>Unfortunately, both games suffer from extremely short game time. That comes with the territory though :/. Rhythm games, such as these, are short because each stage is the length of a song.. about 5 to 10 minutes. Each song takes time to craft and compose, so it stands that you'll have no more than a hand full of levels.</p><p>Parappa has 8 stages and Gitaroo man has 11. I just started Gitaroo Man this morning, and after an hour and a half, I'm at the final level. With those remixes, Parappa has an extended life time, but Gitaroo Man does not. Sure, you can go back and get perfect grades on levels, but it's nothing you hadn't seen before.</p><p>I think both games have multiplayer. Gitaroo Man has always had multiplayer, but I think they tacked it on for Parappa PSP. That might be kinda fun..</p><div class='title'><b>To recap</b></div><p>Gitaroo Man is an excellent addition in the Rhythm genre, and you'd be a fool to pass it up. Parappa on the other hand with get sales because of the nostalgia, but shitty gameplay completely ruins this game.. you'd be a fool to buy it, especially at full price.</p><p>Though, I find it ironic that I still hum Parappa songs before I'd ever hum a Gitaroo Man song. I guess replaying the damn level over and over and over again really puts that song into your head. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Brain Age 2 + Rainbow Styli" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/brain-age-2-rainbow-styli">Brain Age 2 + Rainbow Styli</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After playing Online co-op with Justin on the first day of Halo, it was apparent that I needed a headset in order to communicate back and forth with him.  Typing up messages through AIM was simply too slow, and, unfortunately, I could not find Gage's headset anywhere.. even after tearing apart that closet.</p><p>So, I ran out to stores real quick and picked up the Halo 3 Limited Edition Wireless Headset.. Oohhh..  It comes with everything you see here:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" /><br/>Yeah, that's it.  Just the headset and the recharging cord, all for the high ticket price of $60.  This was also the same price as the non-Halo 3 headset.  I decided to go with the Halo 3 one because its subtle Halo 3 design wasn't blatant or as ugly as those Halo 3 controllers.</p><div class='title'><b>Way too expensive</b></div><p>Obviously, the big problem with this thing is the price.  The regular wired headset is only $20, and just recently Microsoft released an official Messenger kit, which comes with a mini-keyboard you can hook into your controller, and also comes with a wired headset.  That little pack costs $30.</p><p>I coulda shoulda woulda picked up one of those two products, except I went to Shopko, rather than Best Buy, Gamestop, and another store that probably would have had a bigger selection.  So my choices were a $60 normal set, or a $60 limited edition set.  I really just wanted to get back, rather than spend an hour shopping around, so I pushed aside my cheap ass nature, and bit the bullet.</p><p>It's probably difficult to manufacture, but this thing should really be $40.  Especially when you have the headset and messenger kits far cheaper.</p><div class='title'><b>How it works</b></div><p>This little thing is actually pretty slick.  Once fully charged, you sync up the headset to the 360 like you would with a wireless controller.  Once your 360 is on, hit the synchronize button, and then hit the synchronize button on the headset.  It'll connect to your 360 and link up with the first available player.  You can hit the sync button to cycle through which player the headset is for.</p><p>Unfortunately, that means I bought a $60 headset that is proprietary to the Xbox 360 and can't be used for any other devices.  It's not a blue-tooth headset, so that means, I can't use it on my phone, I can't use it on my computer, and I can't use it on a PS3 (whenever I get one).  That's definitely one advantage the PS3 has over the 360.  Use of non-proprietary products all around.</p><p>If I want a wireless headset for all these devices of mine, I'll need to drop another bit of cash for one.</p><p>Annoying.</p><p>I'm pretty sure you could use any regular wired headset with the 360 controller and  I don't think those are proprietary.</p><div class='title'><b>Crystal Clear</b></div><p>Despite it's cost, It works incredibly well, for the few hours I was using it yesterday.  It didn't pinch my ear and  I could easily and clearly hear Justin on the other end, and he said his end was just the same.  I don't know if I had the sensitivity too high, but he could hear other things going on in the background too.  Like the TV, which I did have kinda loud in the first place.</p><p>It'd be rather interesting to test that out..</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Overall, I'm not too pissed off how useless it outside of Xbox Live..  It works great.  Hopefully they'll be more games I actually want to play on the 360 over Xbox Live for me to take advantage of it..  Otherwise, that $60 really will go to waste.</p><p>Perhaps after my gaming schedule clears up, I'll pick up Tenchu Z and play Co-op with Justin online in that.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this thing at all, unless you play A LOT of Xbox Live.  Even then, I think you'd be FAR better off picking up that Messenger Kit for $30 which comes with the mini-keyboard and wired headset.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3 Initial Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-initial-impressions">Halo 3 Initial Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After a brisk day at work on a dreary rainy day, I finally put my Halo 3 disc into the 360 and joined the One Million users online for its first day.  My main goal was to meet up with Justin and play through some Campaign levels.</p><p>So far, my experience with Halo 3 has been nearly identical to my experience with Halo 2..  Exactly the same gameplay as the previous titles, with very subtle graphic improvements.  It's really funny how identical the graphics are.  I mean, the textures are far more detailed, but the models looks the same, the animations look the same.</p><p>Of course, I'm several months late into this news.  Everyone else already experienced and bitched about it when the Beta began.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Halo 3 takes up right after the end of the Halo 2.  Master Chief finally lands after destroying another Halo, and Cortana is still missing in the hands of the enemy.  Another prophet is hell bent on exterminating humanity, and descends on earth.  You begin your assault against this prophet to protect humanity...</p><p>Something like that anyways...  Despite playing through Halo 1 and 2, I really never paid attention to the story.  The actual story portreyed in those games seemed like running from battle to battle.  The action is what really drove the game, and all the back story and plot fell behind for me.</p><p>That.. and I never cared for Halo at all, so I didn't care to pay attention.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Co-op</b></div><p>Well, today is a brand-new day, and once Justin and I got into the same lobby online, we were off into the single player.  Unfortunately, Co-op campaign was just a little bit laggy for me to really get into it.  It wasn't terribly laggy, but just enough for me to notice.  Running side-by-side with Justin was quite entertaining.</p><p>We only played a little bit, since staying up all night to buy the game really didn't give us time to sleep.  After he took off, I played a bit of Solo.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo Player</b></div><p>Solo I found more legible to play.  I actually knew what was going on, and could find my way around without too much trouble.  I could also stop and look at the environment without getting left behind by Justin.. heh.</p><p>Halo 3's beginning is very parallel to the beginning of Halo 2, but without the whole cheesy special effects space battle at the beginning which was quite entertaining.  I love being back on earth, but I haven't gotten to any cities or urban areas yet..</p><p>One thing I did love about Halo 2 was seeing the metropolis off in the distance, gradually traveling closer, and eventually fighting the covenant inside the city..  fighting in buildings, driving warhogs through the streets..  You actually got to battle the aliens on our home turf and showed them we meant business.</p><p>In Halo 3, I'm still on earth, and they're still plenty of aliens to ward away, so hopefully we'll get into urban environments..  then again, it probably doesn't want to copy Gears of Wars too much.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>I didn't want to get too far in the campaign mode without Justin, so I went over to Multiplayer in full expectations of getting my ass kicked and I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get completely killed, though.  I was able to pull off a couple wins and gain a few ranks</p><p>Halo 3's leveling system is kinda neat.  You get so much Experience points for your placement in ranked matches, which will determine who you are matched up against to battle.  The matchmaker service does everything for you, and it took me NO time to get into a room and start fighting people.  MUCH MUCH better than Lost Planet, which took me 30 minutes to find a decent room on my own, and then be "matched" up against top-level people when I was just beginning.</p><p>Levels are kinda screwy at the moment since everyone is just starting out, but by next week or the week after, the top-players will really start to distance themselves for the mediocre players, and games should be quite balanced.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Statistical Tracking</b></div><p>Bungie keeps track off ALL Xbox Live ranked matches and will update all your stats online with much more detail than what the game will tell you.</p><p>Here are my awesome stats: <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock" title="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock">http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock</a></p><p>Whooo...  At the time of this writing, they aren't exactly up to the minute.  I think I'm a private now, after 6 or 7 matches.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Halo 3 is pretty fun so far..  I think its hilarious how Microsoft is marketing this as the biggest multimedia seller of all time, but, as Tony had pointed out, it's not as big as Harry Potter.</p><p>Also, I'm a mere 3 chapters into the story of the game, and there are supposedly a total of 9 chapters..  short, much?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3 Midnight Release" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-midnight-release">Halo 3 Midnight Release</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This evening marks the release of one of the most anticipated games of all time, Halo 3.  It's a strike for western gaming in the console market.  When Microsoft began treading into Console territory, would anyone had guessed that their IP would be the number one best selling pre-order of all time?</p><p>To mark this event further, Best Buy announced several midnight releases at their stores throughout the country.. One of these stores just happened to be a few blocks away from my house, here in Madison ^_^.</p><p>After watching the season premiere of Heroes, Tony graciously joined me in line in front of Best Buy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" /></p><p>At 9pm, the line really wasn't all that long at all.  Tony and I parked at the end and played some Pacman Vs. on DS.  I was actually surprised that one other person in line actually had a DS, but I wasn't so surprised that most of the other avid Xboxers were tossing around a football and yelling obscenities at each other as loud as they could.  It also didn't surprise me when one of their friends drove on by with Rap music blasting out of their car speakers.</p><p>2 hours went by pretty quickly. After Tony beat me 3 out of 5 matches in Pacman, I tried to write up my Phoenix Wright article but got distracted really easy by Wikipedia and other various pieces of information on the internet.  Apparently Wisconsin has a state fossil..  it's a trilobite.  Minnesota, on the other hand, does not have a state fossil -_-;;</p><p>At 11 o'clock, one of the managers came outside with blue tickets for the Halo 3 inflatable chairs..  It just so happens that Tony and I were at the dead end of receiving the tickets. ^_^.  Hot damn..  Waiting 3 hours in line was just the trick to getting 1 of 25 chairs.</p><p>But these chairs were only given to those who purchased the game, so Tony was 1-up on the other people ahead of us in line who missed their opportunity to grab a ticket.  One lucky fellow, purchased his ticket for a whole $5!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" /></p><p>Now that we were up, I started walking around to get a look at the line.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" /></p><p>When midnight rolled around, it was just about time to get inside..  A few minutes before hand, I went back into the parking lot and got another picture of the line.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" /></p><p>At 11pm, the line extended to a little bit passed the end of the sidewalk, but now the line went all the way back.  Nearly to the entrance of Kohl's.</p><p>At Midnight o'five, we finally got to go into the store..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" /></p><p>Pre-orders to the left, non-pre-orders to the right.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" /></p><p>Just a little more waiting in line, and then Halo 3 was mine.  I missed my opportunity to grab a shirt, but Tony had accidentally gotten 2, so he let me have his extra ^_^.</p><p>After purchasing Halo 3, I redeemed my inflatable chair, and we were off..</p><div class='title'><b>The goods</b></div><p>So...  for $70 and 3 hours of my time, I had gotten the following things:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" /></p><p>Halo 3 Limited Edition, Halo 3 T-shirt, and a Halo 3 Inflatable chair...  which I will probably never open.</p><p>The Halo 3 Limited Edition is amazingly cheap.  The "metal" tin is so delicate and flimsy, I could easily dent the thing.  It's the flimsiest game box I've ever held, honestly..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" /></p><p>Both my game disc and extras disc were jarred free in the game, but did not suffer any damaging scars due to its uncare..  So I should be able to play the game with no problem tomorrow after work.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" /></p><p>Besides the extras disc, it also came with all you see here.  Instruction manuals, advertisements, and a hardcover "art" book, which is really more of a technical details book that lays out all the information about the races, planets and vehicles in Halo.</p><p>meh..  Hopefully the extras disc is worth it..  Right now, I'd almost rather have the regular edition of the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" /></p><p>I took a little peak at the Inflatable Chair, but put it right back into its box.  It might be a pretty fun pool toy ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>Bedtime!</b></div><p>So there you have it..  I have Halo 3, and will be playing it with Justin, tomorrow.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Tony and I powered up both PSPs and set them up for comparison.

Currently, I'm in the middle of 2 games: Oblivion and Phoenix Wright 3.  Since starting Oblivion, I haven't touched Phoenix Wright 3, which is making things difficult.  I want to finish up Phoenix Wright 3 and get it out of the way before Halo 3 comes out next week, but I also want to enjoy Phoenix Wright 3..  I find it somewhat annoying that I'm putting so much emotion stock into Halo 3.....</p><p>Phoenix Wright 3 is a bit better than its previous game, but it's just as boring..  I really only want to progress through the game to the full grasp of story and finish off that series.  I think this weekend, I'm really going to have to power through it, and write my peace on it.</p><p>Getting into Oblivion wasn't the greatest idea either...  I figured that I would just play it for a couple hours and then stop cold turkey because of how crappy it is.. but unfortunately, it is actually better than I thought, and I'm having fun with it ^_^.</p><p>On top of these two games, I want to give Final Fantasy VII a go, and have been waiting to play Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.. but maybe they'll have to wait.  There's a slew of other PSPs games I also want to start playing, too.  Check out my PSP shelf..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" /></p><p>Not bad, huh?  All these games were purchased between $10 and $15, too.  See.. I can still be a cheap ass when the opportunity arises.  There's still a couple PSP games out there that need to drop in price..  like Parappa, Crush, and Innocent Life.</p><p>I'm going to stick to my 2-game policy to prevent myself from burning out.  I must beat Phoenix Wright over the weekend to make way for Halo 3 on Tuesday.  I think when I'm waiting in line for Halo 3, i'll probably play a little more Brain Age 2.</p><p>Anyways, feel free to complain about how much I spend on video games in the comment section. ^_^  I'm going back to Oblivion.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Prime 3 Full Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-prime-3-full-impressions">Metroid Prime 3 Full Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been waiting for a game on the Wii that I could tear apart and dive into without hestitation.  Metroid is that game.</p><p>It's very odd though.. What do I like about Metroid Prime 3?  My overall feelings towards the game are very numb and complacent.  There are so many mediocre points in the game, but are easily looking over while playing the game.</p><div class='title'><b><em>By the way..  this review will continue mountains of spoilers, so please don't read on if you don't wish to be spoiled</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Playing the game..</b></div><p>Playing this game is a dream.  I absolutely love the gameplay.  Honestly, I can see why people are so ape shit about the gameplay and say stupid things like, "This is the best console fps experience you'll ever have."  That's a bold statement, but I think I would agree that the controls are spot on.  Overall, I do prefer this over dual analog sticks.  You get FAR more control and precision shooting things with the Wii-mote.  A little joystick cannot compare to the Wii-mote at all.</p><p>This is how you make a Wii game.  This is how you make full use of the Wii-mote and motion controls with over burdening your gamer.  The little subtle actions of showing off the motion controls are great because they only happen when you're completely focused are flipping a switch, turning screw controls, or pulling out energy containers.</p><div class='title'><b>Reviewing this game..</b></div><p>It's because of this beautiful gameplay that everyone loves the game.  It's the same reason I love it.  So many publications give this game a 10 or a 9.5 simply because of this, but I don't know why they didn't grade the game harsher on its fall backs.  The gameplay is like that genius student in your class that makes up for all the others students getting Cs.  The gameplay is that one cop that goes out on a limb to solve the case in the most elaborate and thorough way (like John Mcclain), while everything else in the game simply plays it straight and safe.</p><p>There's so much mediocrity in this game that is overshadowed by the gameplay that just isn't getting press, but with good reason.  In good conscience can reviewers really just gloss over everything else because it is blantly bad and give it a perfect 10 based on gameplay alone?</p><p>It's weird..  I'm not dissapointed with the game, and I think they did a fantastic job with it too.  Here..  I'll just tell you what I think about it..</p><div class='title'><b>The Music..</b></div><p>The music in Metroid Prime 3 is absolutely bland.  They overuse that organic flange like it was pop rocks in the 80s.  The music is so uninspired, so subtle...  but it doesn't get in your way.  The music doesn't push the environment on you; it's just there to create an ambiance, but doesn't fit with the environment at all.  It reminds me of Doom for some reason, but far more low key.</p><p>The background music does feel very Metroid, but it doesn't feel alien at all.  More mission driven and pumping.</p><p>However, this is completely overruled by One track in the game that had me blown away.  Put me in a state of awe.  That one track I was waiting for the entire game to blow me away.  The Ice level has absolutely beautiful background music.  Fluttering high-note piano music raining snow onto the land, the fields, the statues, and me in the middle of it.</p><p>This was the first point in teh game that I actually stopped for a moment and took it in.  Listened to the beautiful orchestrated notes take me to this place, much like it did back in Metroid Prime 1 with Phendrana..  the Ice planet.  That's kinda weird isn't it?  How can the best two tracks in the Metroid Prime series both be from Ice worlds.  They should make christmas music or something..  Metroid Prime 4: Lost in the Ice Kingdom would probably be the best videogame OST in the history of gaming.</p><p>But that's it.  I went through the Ice world, collected the Screw Attack, and left..  That was it for the entire fricken game..  The only other track that comes close is the menu music..  That's somewhat decent.</p><p>It's rather funny that the quality of Music forms and equal parallel to game overall.  There's one piece of music that keeps you from counting out the music all together.</p><div class='title'><b>The Environments..</b></div><p>This is the first Metroid where you aren't on One planet the whole game.  Overall, you have 5 major planets and a few other places consisting of at least a dozen unique areas of exploration.  Actually, the more I think about it, the diversity within a planet really tells the story of civilization on that planet.  The 5 planets you explore are Norion, Bryyo, Elysia, Pirate Homeworld and Phaze, though I suppose Phaze really doesn't count.</p><p>The environments you encounter through the game are pretty standard.  You walk around on a battle cruiser like in a Halo 2, go through a federation outpost which is pretty standard.  Metroid begins very federation oriented which is unlike any other Metroid and everything like most space opera sci-fi.  Once you finally break free of the federation and begin exploring, you start to encounter actual alien worlds.</p><p>The first alien world is Bryyo and is also the most under developed of the planets.  It's quite interesting that because it's the most under developed, it is also the most varied in enviroments.  You do come across a pirate outpost, but it is thick within the jungle.  On the side of the planet, you have the firey volcanos.  Within the fire pits, you come across a warp point to the Ice caverns.  On this one planet, you have complete polar opposites, somewhat like Earth.</p><p>Because of the varied environments you have all kinds of plant, animal and sentient life, which doesn't make sense why it's the most boring planet of them all.  Hurray i'm in a Jungle.. Hurrah I'm in a volcano.  Hurrah i'm in an ice cavern (but the music is beautiful).  Don't get me wrong, they all look quite good, but don't go that extra mile to really WOW me.  All these environments have already been done in Metroid Prime 1.</p><p>Elysia.  Now HERE is a planet that made me stop and just look around at everything.  Elysia is a lot like Jupiter, a gasious liquid planet that nothing can live on, unless you were in the upper atmosphere away from the violent death storms.  You walk around on a settlement built in the sky which is completely built on <em>Steam</em>.  Oh baby..   A Steampunk planet..  fucking brilliant.</p><p>All the little robots are steam powered.  When you walk around, they are little repair bots working on the station to keep it running and working.  The enemy robots are straight out of 50s scifi.  A very hostile andriod looking robot firing ring beams at you.  I love Elysia, but what really annoyed me was everywhere you went was the same.  You didn't have a multiple varied environments like you did back on Bryyo.</p><p>After Elysia, you go to the Pirate Homeworld was is more standard technology type stuff.  It kinda reminds me of the Borg homeworld and to finish off the game you go to planet Phaze which is beautiful, but pretty standard stuff at this point after going into the Leviathan ships.</p><p>One other spiffy place you can go is optional and it is the remenants of a battle between Federation and Pirates which was over-swarmed by Metroids.  This is my absolute favorite point in the game because you are investigating what actually happened to this federation ship and uncovering clues to the actual menance that awaits you at the end of the game.</p><p>Because this area is optional, you need to find Energy Cells throughout the game to repower doors, ramps and elevators in this deserted graveyard.  There needed to be MUCH MUCH more of this, rather than just chasing around pirates.  Focus the game on METROIDS, not the stupid pirate conspiracies involving metroids.  Use your graphically power to show off how deadly the metroid race is, rather than some submissive controlled species.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroids..</b></div><p>Hey guess what.. let's talk about how under utilized Metroids are in Metroid Prime 3.  How do you kill a Metroid?  This is video game survival 101.  You freeze it, and fire 5 missiles at it which will shatter the monster.  That's pretty much what you do in Metroid Prime 3, however you also kill a Metroid through hypermode or a sniped headshot, which makes it way to easy.</p><p>The whole point of fighting a Metroid is to feel like you are David versus Goliath.  Metroids are ruthless, energy sucking parasites which will devour every ounce of strength you have.  Metroid Prime 3 portreys the Metroid species just as any other creatures in the game.  Just another enemy in your way.  In fact, there are more menancing creatures in the game than Metroids.</p><p>The only scene that came close to showing off Metroid brutality was one Metroid dragging a federation soldiers corpse through a hallway.</p><p>There needs to be a scene, NOT a cutscene, where a bunch of Metroids break free and run rampant through a planet, chewing on the nearby animals, all while you are fending them off and trying to get away before falling victim.  Metroids are basically higher level alien zombies..  Why not feed on the anxiety and suspense of a zombie attack in a Metroid game?</p><p>You'd be fucked if you came up against 3 Metroids.. but not in Metroid Prime 3.  blam blam.. they're dead, you're safe.  bullshit.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story..</b></div><p>Besides that, the story is still rather lacking.  You basically go through space, fighting off pirate advances and learn of the growing menance of Phazon.  All while, the phazon inside of you is growing and slowly taking over.</p><p>Being slowly corrupted is a great plot device, but means nothing when your character doesn't talk or give any emotional indication of being corrupted.  Samus is basically a robot inside of her armor suit.  This is one of things I noticed right away after killing one of her friends in the beginning.  She is emotionally disconnected with the story, which makes it really hard to play a character driven game.</p><p>HOWEVER..  This special ending finally brings emotion into Samus..  It's really a shame that you have to get 75% complete in order to view this ending, because this IS the emotion missing from the game.  Samus lands on Elysia, takes off her helmet and looks into the clouds.  She stares saddenly into the distance and thinks about her friends, their corruption into madness, and her duty to put them down..  It's very powerful, though has crappy music that could have made it more powerful.</p><p>The super special ending after getting 100% complete continues from there.  She walks back to her ship, takes off the rest of her suit, and then goes into space.  After flying into the distance, another ship rises from the surface as well, and follows her.  OMG sequel!</p><div class='title'><b>blah blah blah..</b></div><p>To sum it up, Metroid Prime 3 is pretty slick.  It is a great example of how game developers need to utilize the Wii-mote's abilities to the fullest.  Definitely play this game.  <em>This is the best game on the Wii right now.</em></p><p>As you can see from all the text above, I don't really feel overly amazed by the game, but it definitely doesn't suck.  There's a ton of potential that didn't follow through, but it is a joy to play and is very solid too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-prime-3-first-impressions">Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 28, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, the Wii finally got its first big release that wasn't a ported game from another console..  Metroid Prime 3 is out in stores, though you might have some difficultly locating it.  I traded in Big Brain Academy and Rayman Raving Rabbits to Gamestop for a full-price reserve a month or two ago, so i was set.  Also, when I went to pick it up today, I put in a reserve for Mass Effect. ^_^</p><p>I could hardly wait to play this game today.  Don't get me wrong, learning about concurrency and thread-safety, while implementing processes for work is rather interesting..  but it can't really compare against shooting things with the Wii-mote..  or can it?</p><div class='title'><b>Let's begin...</b></div><p>As you wake up from Cryostasis, you are inside your spaceship.  You can look around, push buttons, but eventually have to open communications with the Starfleet, rendezvous with them, and speak with the admiral.  It's a very non-game moment where you're in character, much like the beginning of Half-life or Halo.  Once aboard the ship, you can walk around and talk with people.  Of course, you don't talk back..  you're a Nintendo Character, after all.</p><p>The gameplay is pretty fluid, but does take a little getting used to.  The biggest hurdle I've been trying to get over is that the Z button holds your view, rather than the B button, as it is in Resident Evil 4.  The B Button in Metroid is jump.  So when ever I try to fire at something, I end up jumping around first before actually locking on to them.  :slaps forehead:</p><p>As soon as I began walking around, Tony said that everyone online recommends switching your look to "advanced" rather than the defaulted "normal".  Thank you Tony/Internet.  Normal and Advanced are basically degrees of when your view will move with where you point the cursor.  In Normal you have to point near the edge of the screen before your viewpoint actually turns in that direction.  With Advanced, your viewpoint will always turn when the cursor isn't in the middle of the screen.  It will turn to the degree with respect to how far away your cursor is from the middle.  It feels much more natural.</p><p>There's also other neat little Wii-mote movements, like turning key-locks, pumping other locks, and swinging the nunchuck around to use the grapple-beam..  Everything is quite intuitive ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Getting into it..</b></div><p>There really hasn't been much of a story yet..  Space Pirates attack, you repel them..  You get infected by Plasma or whatever it's called..  You investigate other stuff..</p><p>The story telling style is rather awkwardly paced.  In some cases, you have full dialogue of your mission objectives and what is actually happening around you.  But in other instances, when you're on the planet fighting, the gameplay is directing the story..</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b>: At the beginning you have a bunch of your Bounty Hunter buddies, that help you fight off the space pirates.  Later, after you've all been infected, you search a planet where one of them had been last seen.  You end up fighting one of your pals after he's been completely corrupted, but NOT once do you ever show remorse for his situation, nor when you kill him.. </em></p><p><em>Metroid Prime 3 feels very disconnected emotionally because of this..  If Samus doesn't care about killing one of her friends, how am I supposed to feel any compassion towards her.  I don't see this motif changing..</em></p><div class='title'><b>Achievements..</b></div><p>Something pretty slick Metroid has adopted, is the notion of achievements..  and they take many different forms.  You get a little achievement when you scan a monster (red coins), when you scan some lore (blue coins), when you defeat a boss (yellow coins), and other little random ones (tags).  There's also green coins, which I haven't figured out how to get.</p><p>All the coins you acquire can be traded in for unlockables: Concept Art, Background music, and, my favorite, stuff for your car (spaceship).  You can get bumperstickers for your spaceship.  You can get Bobblehead figurines for your dashboards.  All kinds of stupid crap.  Most of them require green coins, though :/</p><p>The tags, on the other hand, work with your friends list.  I've gotten tags for killing 100 enemies, killing 200 enemies, and 2 other things which I can't recall.  You can use these tags to send a friend voucher to someone on your list.  I sent one to Erika and Dave..  What do they do?!</p><div class='title'><b>The Atmosphere..</b></div><p>One of the things I did love in Metroid Prime 1, was the music..  ESPECIALLY Phendrana, the Ice level.  The music was absolutely ambient, subtle, and atmospheric.  I just wanted to sit back and take it in..  So far, Metroid Prime 3's music has been sub-par to ass.  Honestly, it's so un-memorable, I can't even remember what it sounds like when I try to recall it.</p><p>Music in a game is pretty important for me..  It'll make a mediocre game memorable, and a fantastic game boring, for me.  All of my all-time favorite games have very much to do with having an excellent soundtrack.  So when a game is somewhat boring enough for me to notice that the music is pretty stupid, there's a problem.</p><p>I'm pretty disappointed by this, but there is FAR more game left to surprise.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I'm at..</b></div><p>After I finally exited out of Metroid Prime 3, my time was 4 hours.  I'm at 12% complete of the game, too.  I'm guessing I'll probably finish the game around 20 or 25 hours.  Remember, the percentage is the total amount of stuff done in the game, not your progression through the story.</p><p>Despite being disappointed by a couple things, I am having fun with it..  I can't wait to see what happens when we start getting into rogue Aurora Units and Metroid conspiracies..  I'll definitely be disappointed if neither of those two things happen.</p><p>Right now, there seems to be a lot going on..  So that's good ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Planet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-planet">Lost Planet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lost Planet is one of those super-hyped games on the 360 last Christmas season.  Superb Graphics, Superb Gameplay, Superb so forth..  Right before It came out, all the retails had in store demos, and when I played the game, I thought it was just god awful.  The controls felt so slow and inaccurate that I couldn't get any joy out of it.</p><p>Well, the other day, I read an article on 1up from creator Keiji Inafune, who is also the creator of Megaman and Dead Rising.  When creating the game engine for Dead Rising and Lost Planet, he assembled all of his friends from his glory days in early Capcom history.  All his pals that spent those lonely nights developing Megaman 2 with him were all back developing these 360 titles.</p><p>Being of like mind, they designed both Dead Rising and Lost Planet with Megaman in mind.  After they finished the game engine, the lead developer came to Inafune and said, "my work is done.  we can now bring Megaman to the next generation."</p><p>After hearing this, I was astounded.  This was the main impetus behind developing Lost Planet?  To further refine their next-gen Megaman engine?  Maybe I misjudged this game.</p><p>So.. I set forth to find a copy of Lost Planet and give it a fair shake.  Perhaps I overlooked the love behind the money.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Planet</b></div><p>Lost Planet is about a new planet found by humans to further their exploration in space.  It is a desolate frigid iceberg.  One day while attempting to further their understanding of the planet, Aliens known as the Akrid attack the humans.  "Holy crap!  There's aliens in dem hills"  Humanity gets their ass kicked, but develops mechas known as VS to battle the Akrid.</p><p>Thus, the war between humans and aliens begins.</p><p>You are Wayne.  One of these common workers on the planet, to further mining and expanding the human society on the planet, when a gigantic Akrid attacks and kills off your father.. figure.  When you run away, you're lost in a snow storm in pass out.  Then a girl with huge breasts and a tight outfit despite subzero temperatures finds you, along with this dork and a mysterious scientist.  And you go around and do some missions for them all while finding your purpose in life.</p><p>Typical animu bullshit.  The story is absolutely ridiculous and the plot doesn't make any sense.  For the longest time, you're fighting this organization that wants to terraform the planet, but you keep trying to stop them.  Isn't that the damn point of being on this planet in the first place?!  You want humanity to be able to inhabit this planet.  Why is your goal to prevent this?!</p><p>Eventually you find out that terraforming the planet will kill everything on it.  Well, let's do it.  Light the shit up.  ugh..</p><p>Anyways..  the story really isn't the reason I got the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Gameplay</b></div><p>What's really ironic about this whole experience is the gameplay.  I'm playing this game for the gameplay.  And that is also the most annoying thing about the game.  The annoying story is really only fueled by how annoying the gameplay is, otherwise the story would just be hilariously bad.  Something to jest about.</p><p>Just like my original expression of the gameplay, it is slow, unresponsive and an overall pain in the ass if you want to pull off any sort of precision.  Nearly all bosses require you to fight in a VS, which are incredibly slow.  Jumping takes an extra second to get lift off the ground.  There's no quick movement to dodge away from attacks.  You really have to know the boss strategy and have patience in order to effectively win the game, which doesn't translate in multiplayer at all.</p><p>Pain in the ass.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>What's worse about this game is the single player is the only thing you can do these days.  No one is playing multiplayer because there's better things out there these days.  Everyone is playing Rainbow 6 Vegas or GRAW.</p><p>360 games are such fads.  The media hypes the shit out of them, and everyone is playing when it first comes out.  But 6 months later, the online rooms are vacant.  360 gamers have moved on to their next overly hyped game and playing that multiplayer.</p><p>Of course, the failure of multiplayer for Lost Planet is partly due to the horrible gameplay.  How are you supposed to get all the multiplayer achievement points when you can't play multiplayer?  Gamers are off playing their new game for achievements, and left this game behind.</p><p>People seem to think that the Wii is a fad, but jesus..  How are 360 fps games not a fad?  Gamers move from one game to the next and retailers only retain the cash difference between the New price and the trade-in price.</p><p>This over-saturation is ridiculous.  Their are too many games out, and too many games coming out to justify paying $60 per game.  Honestly, this only decreases the quality of games and makes them "snack-size" rather than something you can really sink your teeth into.  Even Resident Evil 4 I could really sink my teeth into, but it wasn't enough.  It was a 10 hour game.</p><div class='title'><b>Crap</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost Planet is crap.  I'm through kidding myself that this game is something special.  Unfortunately, Inafune, your gameplay is just too annoying.  I wanted to like this game, but playing it just pisses me off.  You can't even beat the final boss, goddammit.</p><p>Don't buy this game and rent other games instead.  The Single player really isn't worth your time.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/9">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/reviews/7">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
