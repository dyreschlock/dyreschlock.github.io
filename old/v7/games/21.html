| August 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Greetings all from Seattle again.  Yesterday, I spent most of the day running around in awe of everything.  My sense were overloaded and I was more in the mood of seeing everything as soon as possible, swiping all the free stuff, and..  pretty much taking in everything at once.  Actually, my first <em>first</em> objective was to find a copy of Phoenix Wright 3, but alas..  Pink Godzilla has not gotten a copy just yet.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0258.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0258.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0258.webp" /></p><p>sad...</p><p>Pink Godzilla did have two games..  well three games that sparked my interest, but nothing enough to purchase.  These were Doki Doki Mahou Showtime (i think that's the title) on the DS, Face Training on the DS, and Cosmic Smash for the Dreamcast.  Honestly, I don't think I'll get more than 5 minutes worth of OOhhh and AAahh out of the DS games.  And Cosmic Smash was $75..  just a little too pricey, despite being the only DVD cased Dreamcast I don't have.  hmm..  I probably should have taken a picture of these..  oh well.</p><p>Anyways, today was all about the games.  Watching demos, playing demos, and doing some hardcore video game journalism by writing up impressions on early builds which don't reflect the final product.</p><p>Here's a few pics from the way in:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0243.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0243.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0243.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0245.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0245.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0245.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Conan</b></div><p>by THQ for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3</p><p>Dan was super interested in Conan and defintely wanted to give it a whirl, so this was the first game of the day.  Conan is the story of Conan the Barbarian and his adventures storming spartan controlled camps and utterly tearing apart their bodies.  It was a pretty entertaining game to watch, since Conan has particular combos that lay havok on soldiers resulting in both arms being sliced off at the soldier followed up by a kick to the chest sending their head flying at the screen.</p><p>Honestly, I wonder how many next-gen titles have an M rating.  Doesn't it seem like every game you come across, you're either shooting up some guy, and slicing some dude across the chest?</p><p>Anyways, the game looking pretty fun.  Definitely not worth $60, as is the case with nearly all next-gen titles, but whenever the demo is available on Xbox live, check it out for well spent 20 minutes of senseless brutality.  The full version will probably be more of the same, which will probably get quite old after the first level or two.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0247.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0247.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0247.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo HD Remix</b></div><p>by Capcom for Xbox Live and PSN</p><p>While waiting for the Mass Effect live demo, I played a little bit of Puzzle Fighter since it was right next to me.</p><p>The HD remix looks quite beautiful, but some of the alterations in the game will keep me from downloading.  The sprites are beautiful, but the gems are needlessly overdone.  They sparkle with lens flares, and explode when destroyed, rather than shatter.  They make explosion sounds too, rather than shattering sounds :/</p><p>They also altered the gameplay a little bit.  They changed some character's drops to be more balanced, but they also changed around the patterns of gems that normally drop.  In the original, they was always one color that dropped more than the other through the match.  This made it easy to figure which color to group together and eventually build a massive gems out of to topple your opponent.</p><p>Now, this has changed so you start off having an abundance of one color, but eventually changing to another color before the Diamond drops.  Then after the diamond, it shifts again to another dominent color.  Pain in the ass for loyalists of Puzzle Fighter.</p><p>I guess the balancing and unpredictability isn't so bad..  but the stupid gem explosions and lens flares are absolutely needless.  Screw you, Capcom.</p><p>I wonder what stupid needless alterations will be in Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix.</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect</b></div><p>by Bioware, exclusively for Xbox 360</p><p>I've had a very disapproving relationship with Mass Effect based from my initial bias against the Xbox in general.  Despite actually liking the Xbox 360, and a couple games on the machine, ever since the original Xbox was announced and released, How dare microsoft and PC gaming tread into my territory of console gaming... blah blah blah.</p><p>When Mass Effect was announced, i didn't care at all.  Then i learned that Bioware was the developer and finally realized why people gave a shit about it.  Bioware had previously done such Game of the Year worthly titles as Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 1 and 2 on Xbox 1..  and later did Jade Empire.  All 3 of which I have never played, and also carried no interest towards.</p><p>After watching 1up's 15 minute Mass Effect preview, I suddenly saw why people were so ape shit about this title.  My hyped opinion went from "eh" to "damn..  maybe i'll rent it or something."  Definitely check out the video, btw.  I showed the video to a couple people and they were completely thrown back by it.</p><p>So today, Microsoft's booth held a live demo of Mass Effect which highlighted the conversation gameplay and the battle gameplay.  Ya know, the two key elements to any RPG-like game.  Conversation was amazingly smooth.  Conversation cues were easily integrated within a cutscene FAR more fluidly than KOTOR of Jade Empire.  You're able to select your response before the other's finish talking, so you aren't sitting at a selection screen of what to say..  The conversation actually feels like a real time conversation.</p><p>Past that, the fighting system is rather intuitive as well.  Mass Effect is really pioneering the first FPS RPG.  Switching back and forth between weapons is very fast, and it's just as easy to switch your teammates weapons too.  Hit a button and the weapon selection overlay is displayed.  Click on the weapon, and you're back in battle.</p><p>From watching the demo, I totally felt immersed within the conversation, the action, and the outcome of the decisions chosen through the demo.</p><p>After this, my hyped opinion went from "maybe rent" to "buy on day 1."  Honestly, this game is absolutely impressive.  The slow dialogue from KOTOR and Jade Empire is totally removed.  The shooting gameplay brings the action to a whole new level in their games.  See for yourself with 1up's preview..</p><p>The hilarious problem with Mass Effect is that the release date is November 12th.  The same day, Assassin's Creed, Super Mario Galaxy, NiGHTS 2, Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles, and about 5 other notable games are released.  The day that will probably have the greatest amount of video game sales the entire christmas season.  Actually, I don't really see this so much as a problem because I don't really care so much about those other games.  I'd buy Mass Effect before them, so all is good..  I might pick up Resident Evil if Circuit City has it for $40 though.</p><p>The most kickass piece of SWAG I've acquired from the Penny Arcade Expo has been the Mass Effect novel.</p><div class='title'><b>Penny Arcade Adventures</b></div><p>by Hothead Gaming for the PC</p><p>Next up, we went a few booths over to check out the Live demo of the Penny Arcade game.  I haven't been keeping up on this at all.  In fact, I really don't care since I don't think Penny Arcade is funny in the slightest.</p><p>The Demo started by going through the character creation process, and then started up the game playing that character.  The penny arcade game is very well drawn.  I might not like Tycho's humor so much, but Gabe's artwork is quite decent.   It's amazing to see how much his skills have improved over time.  Just check out today's comic, and then check out his first comic.  You will see 7 or 8 years of improvement.</p><p>I'm not really a big fan of the 3d presented in the game, but all the cutscenes are 2d, drawn by Gabe.  And the charcter you've made, is also in these cutscenes.  So each possible combination that can created from the Character creator is replicated in these 2d "hand" drawn cutscenes.  I don't think I've ever seen a game do that before..</p><p>The 2d cutscenes are great, but the gameplay is rather standard.  It's set up like your standard turn based RPG, where you get caught up in battles, and all that jazz.  It's kinda sad to see so much innovation in the Art and presentation, and have the game fall flat in how you play it. :/</p><p>Oh well...  Fans will still play through for the story, the humor and the art.  If you like Penny Arcade, you'll probably like the game ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0251.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0251.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0251.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Time Crisis 4</b></div><p>by Namco for Playstation 3</p><p>With the release of the Wii, you'd think that all these arcade shooters would be find an easy home where you didn't have to buy any more gun peripherals.  Well not true..  both Time Crisis 4 and House of the Dead 4 will be on the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, respectively.  Pretty stupid..  At least it makes sense with Time Crisis, since that has always been Playstation exclusive, but House of the Dead?  eh.. I suppose the arcade HotD4 is using Sega's Xbox 360 unit.  Whatever..  I still want House of the Dead 4 on Wii.  Ghost Squad is crap.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0252.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0252.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0252.webp" /></p><p>For Time Crisis 4, Namco is releasing a new Guncon which has all the buttons of a Playstation controller represented.  It also features light sensors placed on the upper corners of your television to detect and report on your screen position.  It's the light gun of the future, seeing how TVs don't use progressive scan lines anymore.  You should be able to use this Gun on all previous Time Crisis games too.</p><p>Time Crisis 4 is kinda fun.  I never played it in the Arcade because shooting up zombies with an Uzi in House of the Dead 4 was WAY more fun than shooting terrorists for the billionth time.</p><p>Time Crisis 4 does feature weapon selecting which is a new change for the series.  You have your standard pistol, machine gun, shotgun, and grenade launcher.  Certain situations call for different attacks and certain bosses can be taken down faster with certain guns.  This adds a very real-time tactical approach to a very fast paced game.</p><p>Even with a few innovations, Time Crisis is just more of the same.  Hardcode Time Crisis fans will probably pick it up, but I really don't see the average gamer buying this.  I mean, the game'll be $60, and the gun will probably be another $20.  $80 on an Arcade shooter?!  Hell no.  You could spend half that, $40, on Ghost Squad for the Wii instead and not have that extra $20 for a peripheral.  This is why Namco puzzles me with this release.  Same with Sega and House of the Dead 4.  ARgghghghh..</p><p>Bring House of the Dead 4 to the Wii.  OR..  even better.  Bring House of the Dead collection to the Wii with new graphics.</p><p>Ummm..  what else did I play..</p><div class='title'><b>Vision Training</b></div><p>by Nintendo & Namco for the DS.</p><p>Nintendo had a pretty slick setup with DSes around the perimeter of several Wii setups with Mario Strikes, Fire Emblem and Metroid Prime 3.</p><p>I wanted to play Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass..  but the demo was so long, the people perched themselves in front of it for 20-30 minutes at a time.  It took forever to finally get on it.</p><p>The first time, I gave up on Zelda and tried out Vision Training, conveniently placed next to it.  It had one game where several C's popped on the screens and you had to recall which direction they were facing.  Pretty standard Training game.</p><p>It was so damn easy though.  First try, I got the first 8 in a row, and then screwed up on the last two.  I still got the high score though.  What the crap?!  In fact, everyone I saw play the game got a perfect score of having their vision age in their 20s.  What the hell do you have to do to fail it?</p><p>Vision Training was a pretty dumb attempt at another Training game..  skip.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0246.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</b></div><p>by Nintendo for Nintendo..  DS</p><p>After that waste of time, I got back up and stood in line determined to play Phantom Hourglass..  and after this fat guy in front of me got so fed up trying to figure out this simple puzzle.  The game was mine!</p><p>Watching this guy continuously fail at this puzzle already gave me enough time to know how to solve it.  There were a series of 4 levers, and you had to pull them in the correct order.  Two stone tablets on opposite ends of the room gave exact directors on which ones to pull when.  I was rather amazed this guy didn't get it.</p><p>The puzzle gave me the opportunity to use the MOST needed, MOST useful, MOST thoughtful piece of gameplay added to any video game..  A map that you can write on.  The one tablet said to pull the lever first.  I pulled down my menu and jotted the information down.  Then I did the same with the other tablet.  That is so damn useful..</p><p>The weird thing about Phantom Hourglass is that Link is controlled completely using the stylus.  You move the fairy around on the screen, and link runs in the direction.  You double tap stuff to interact with them.  To kill enemies, to talk to people, to pick up rocks and pots.  You draw a circle around yourself to do a spin attack.  It sounds really funky, but it works out pretty well.</p><p>And if you don't like that, I think you can switch back to the old style of control.</p><p>The demo was standard Legend of Zelda stuff though..  Solve puzzles.  Kill enemies.  Explore the island.  The large innovation is really the controls..  but it's still good 'ol Zelda at heart.</p><p>I read an interview with the producer of Phantom Hourglass a couple months ago.  When asked about what he felt about Nintendo's turn towards the casual and hardcore gaming concerns and all that.. something like that anyways.  He responded that Phantom Hourglass has been a very surprising success for Nintendo.  He's never seen so many "casual" gamers pick up a more "hardcore" game like Legend of Zelda.</p><p>Games like Brain Age and Wii Sports have been a gateway for these people into gaming, but games like Legend of Zelda have been a bridge into more traditional gaming, and have been made an even bigger success because of that.</p><p>He was pretty excited about it...  Although there's still plenty concern about Nintendo's shift towards more casual gaming.  I dont' really see it as anything to be concerned about just yet.  "Casual" and "Hardcore" games like Guitar Hero, Rockband and DDR have had and will have tremendous success because of both audiences..</p><p>Something that does concern me is Mario Party 8 being the Wii 2nd best selling game. :/</p><div class='title'><b>Assassin's Creed</b></div><p>by Ubisoft Montreal exclusively for the Playstation 3</p><p>This is another one of those games coming out on November 12th, but, really, the only game that PS3 owners will care about.  This is made by the developing minds by Prince of Persia Sands of Time and attempts to accomplish some very pretentious goals.</p><p>Assassin's Creed was presented as a panel headed by the chief Creative Designer.</p><p>I was pretty neat.  He started by going through a little bit of the design process.  What their goals were when creating this new IP for Ubisoft.  They wanted to do away with "video game" rules of physics and physical conduct, and keep much of the interaction with the world grounded..  but still bend that enough to make that game a lot of fun.</p><p>The set forth and designed a free roaming game engine that took the environment into account, rather than having scripted levels where the game already knew what you were going to do.  With such a flexible game engine, level designers had nearly ultimate freedom on the 3 cities of Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Another goal of the Assassin Team was to base the game in actual factual history, rather than just a setting.  The chief designer was a little bit of a history buff, and attempted to recreate the 1100 world of 3 major middle eastern cities including Jerusalem.  Assassin's Creed's Jerusalem isn't a picture perfect model, but you get the feel of having a massive city for you to traverse.</p><p>The Cheif Designer continued the presentation talking about the game engine and giving examples of it's free roaming capabilities.  He had a few movies of the character running around in the environment.  Then he'd restart the movie, move around the objects in the field, and play it again with the character being able to detect where everything had been moved to an act accordingly.  It was quite impressive.</p><p>Most of these interactable objects where wooden bars going across the tops of streets, and bricks sticking out of buildings.  Part of the free-roaming capabilities were jumping from these pegs to peg, and climbing up anything that stuck out of a wall at least 2 inches.  You didn't even need to press any buttons to interact with these objects..  Simply walk up to them and the game knows what you want to do, and it'll do it.  Run into a wall and you'll climb up it.  Run off the edge of the building and if there's something to jump to, you'll do it.  No sense cluttering the controls with useless functions when the game will do it for you.</p><p>That's simply the gameplay mechanics of movement.  He went on to discuss character interactions which was part of another Goal: Crowds.  Not enough games, he said, give you a real sense of a city.  In a city, you have millions of people walking around.  And you can't just run at full speed through the crowd..  You run into physical resistance.  With Assassin's Creed you can gentle push people out of your way, knock people over, and easily get knocked over or pushed as well.</p><p>People don't just sit back and let you knock around the good citizens of Jerusalem.  You've got a price to pay for being an asshole.  People will start pushing back.  And if you start a fight with a perfect stranger, good citizens will rise up against you and make you pay.  Not to mention if a guard sees you fucking around, you can expect a battle.</p><p>Next he delves into combat, and talked about how he tried to bring realism into the fight scene too..  That one really wasn't as apparent as the previous two goals.  It just looked like Fable or whatever..</p><p>Overall, Assassin's Creed looked pretty bad ass.  The free-roaming nature was not unlike taking Grand Theft Auto to the next level but back in time.  I can see Playstation 3 owners being very happy about this game.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest of the day...</b></div><p>That was pretty much it for games throughout the day..  There are some pretty fun games coming out, but a far too many sub-par games for the price of $60.  I'll spend the $70 on Mass Effect's Collector's Edition, but beyond that..  I'm going to take advantage of any deal for a next-gen game at full price..  Meaning that, Circuit City's $10 off a newly released game will have my business if i want a newly released game.</p><p>There are so many games coming out this Christmas season..  So much competition..  I think that a lot of games are going to get overlooked just because people are still playing the games from the previous month or two.  If Bioshock came out in November, there's no way it would have the same success as it had this week.  No way in hell.</p><p>Anyways, After we returned from Ivan's down on the shoreline, I attended the 1up Yours live show a little late.  Theater B wasn't really much of a theater than it was a corner of the large entrance hall.  That made hearing anything very difficult through the ambiance of chatter throughout the Con.  Overall, hearing it didn't really matter so much, since it'll be online this coming Friday..  It was neat to see all the 1up Yours guys in person doing their show.</p><p>Afterwards, I went up to the tables, shook their hands, and got a photo of 'em, minus Garnet.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0257.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0257.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070825_pax/100_0257.webp" /></p><p>Good times ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>On into the night...</b></div><p>After the 1up Yours live show, we headed to the Auditorium to catch all the evening's concerts.  First up was Gabe, Tycho and the Omeganauts playing Rockband.  Next with Jonathon Coulton,  Then MC Frontalot.  And finally the Minibosses.</p><p>I had never heard of Jonathon Coulton, but everyone I was with certainly had.  His songs were pretty damn hilarious..  Check 'em out.. I'm sure they're on his site.</p><p>Seeing the Minibosses live was another one of those Life Goals of mine which had finally be achieved.  The Minibosses were pretty much the first all video game remix band.  They exclusively did background music from NES games.  Castlevania 1, 2, 3, Megaman 2, Super Mario 2, Excitebike, Double Dragon, Metroid..  all using Guitar Riffs.  They began the night with the opening scene of Super Metroid on the Space Colony.</p><p>I've loved the Minibosses ever since first coming across one of their songs on the internet in the early 2000s.  If I looked around enough through my files, I could probably pinpoint a more specific year.</p><p>The night was just as fantastic as the day.</p><div class='title'><b>As a whole...</b></div><p>The Penny Arcade Expo was quite amazing.  As mentioned before, this has been the most organized Con I have ever been to.  It has been a joy to attend, and seeing the smiles on everyone's faces is proof that I'm not the only one.  I will gladly attend next year.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Penny Arcade Expo - Day 1" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/penny-arcade-expo-day-1">Penny Arcade Expo - Day 1</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The air is rather pure, with a slight accent of pine, the streets are rather clean for a rather large metropolis, and there are farely few bums to be found.</p><p>I'm in Seattle because of the nation's large gaming get together, the <b>Penny Arcade Expo</b> or PAX.  The year is year number 4, which has been relocated to the Washington Community Center where I had attended Sakura-con back in April.</p><p>Last night, I got into the area around Midnight or so, met up with Dan & Becky, and pretty much went straight to bed since Midnight = 2AM local time, for me.  This morning I woke up at 7AM, which is pretty amazing.  Rarely am I awake and ready to hit the town so early, until I realized, it was actualy 9AM local time, for me.</p><p>We got over to PAX about 8.30-ish where the line had already begun to form, despite PAX not opening until 2pm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0160.webp" /></p><p>The line was kinda long, but was it really worth it to sit in line for close to 5 hours, just to get inside right as it opened? I mean, the Con itself will be pretty widely opened later.  Yeah, screw this line crap.  let's tour!</p><p>We went down the road to Pike's Peer or Pike's Place or whatever you wish to call it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0162.webp" /></p><p>Pike's Peer is a cornucopia of local farmers, fisherman, floral-men, gift shops, etc. all along the waterfront of the Seattle bay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0164.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0166.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0167.webp" /></p><p>Absolutely beautiful..  How can you not love Seattle.  Honestly..</p><p>Also on Pike's Peer is the Starbucks Number 1.  The first Starbucks ever made.  The originator.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0179.webp" /></p><p>Out front were a bunch of hippy musicians.</p><p>This stand has a bunch of chiles on a string!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0181.webp" /></p><p>Inside Pike's Peer was an aptly named sushi bar, Umai Sushi & Teriyaki.  Umai is kind of a trendy word for delicious or super delicious in Japan.  Kinda like "Yum" or "Yummy" in our vocabulary.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0182.webp" /></p><p>After Pike's Peer we walked past the Art Museum, and visited the Seattle Public Library, which is a marvel of modern-esq architecture..  Difficult to photograph in tight quarters though :/</p><p>It was starting to get close to 2pm, so we decided to head back to PAX and sit in line once again.  We took a shortcut through the park</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0194.webp" /></p><p>Back at the Con, the line had grown just a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0199.webp" /></p><p>But it really wasn't too long before began to move, and we were past the gates and inside the exhibition hall.</p><p>more pictures!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0202.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0203.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0205.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0206.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0207.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0212.webp" /></p><p>4pm rolled around very quickly, which was when the guest of honor, Wil Wheaton, was to give his keynote speach.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0220.webp" /></p><p>Wil Wheaton gave an amazing speech of his childhood growing up with games, what games really meant to him, and how gaming is really the social pinacle of our lives as gamers.  The fact that gaming a social medium on the same level as any other hobby, and it is also an artist medium on the same level as movies and fine art.</p><p>He also blasted any political critics that defined gaming as anti-social, because in our own lives, gaming is nothing but a social activity.  How else would 30,000 gamers come together at one location to be with each other, simply because we ARE gamers.  This is no difficult than a bunch of sports fan packing into a stadium to watch a game.  Nothing different than state citizens coming together for a state fair.</p><p>As he said to finish off his speech..  if you find someone who thinks that gaming is anti-social.  you should invite him over sometime to play a game, and see what they think of it. ^_^</p><p>Great speech overall..  Hopefully the PAX07 dvd will be released containing it.  If not, hopefully the video will pop up on YouTube at some point.  It's probably there now..  maybe.</p><p>After Wil Wheaton's speech, Gabe and Tycho take the stage for some hilarious Q & A.  One Q resulted in Tycho singing on stage, which resulted in everyone holding their lighters in the air, or in the case of us gamers..  our DS screens.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0227.webp" /></p><p>As a special ironic treat, Gabe & Tycho has a special guest star for an improtu appearance after their Q&A.  Someone reveared in the gaming community.  To their dismay, they were unable to get Jack Thompson to attend, but got the next best guest..  Uwe Boll.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0229.webp" /></p><p>haha.  It was rather hilarious that they actually got him to come to PAX and speak to the crowd..  but it didn't really pay off all that much.  This guy is pretty damn boring, and just ended up talking about random things that weren't interesting.  Joystiq taped a <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/25/pax-07-uwe-bolls-guest-appearance-on-video/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/08/25/pax-07-uwe-bolls-guest-appearance-on-video/">video of Uwe Boll on stage</a>.</p><p>Outside, I ran into Mr. Destructoid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0230.webp" /></p><p>And we continued looking around the exhibition hall.</p><p>They had an aquarium cooled PC box.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070824_pax/100_0236.webp" /></p><p>It was around this time that we caught up with Ace & Jess, who were working at the Con, later in the night.  We went a couple blocks away to an amazing Asia-esq restaurant, Wild Ginger.  A very trendy semi-upscale restaurant where the food was fantastic.  I had the Mushrooms and Peapods.</p><p>Back at the Con, we were getting pretty tired but hung around a little while for the One-Ups, which were the first headliners at this evenings concert.  The was starting to wear on us though, so we began to make our way back to the room for the evening.<br/>___</p><p>I must say that PAX is quite impressive.  Not only have a had a great time seeing a ton of new games, met Mr. Destructoid, listened to Wil Wheaton talk passionately about gaming, and so forth.. but the Con itself is amazing organized.  For already having 30,000 registered people at this Con, everything is spread out enough that you're hardly cramped for space.</p><p>Even all the standing in lines hasn't been that bad at all because everyone had been sifted off into areas that could accommodate everyone.</p><p>There's so little frustration with the way everything in being handled that all you see is everyone having a great time.  No one is pissed off, or bitchy.  When you look at random people, they have smiles across their faces.</p><p>So far, I'm having a great time here, and it's really amazing to have that Con spirit rekindled inside of myself after getting so damn bored at Anime Conventions.  These resurfaced feelings of being at Con remind of the first time I went to Anime Iowa back in 2002 or 2001.</p><p>Fantastic.<br/>___</p><p>Anywho.. more to follow on tomorrow's events. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Planet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-planet">Lost Planet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lost Planet is one of those super-hyped games on the 360 last Christmas season.  Superb Graphics, Superb Gameplay, Superb so forth..  Right before It came out, all the retails had in store demos, and when I played the game, I thought it was just god awful.  The controls felt so slow and inaccurate that I couldn't get any joy out of it.</p><p>Well, the other day, I read an article on 1up from creator Keiji Inafune, who is also the creator of Megaman and Dead Rising.  When creating the game engine for Dead Rising and Lost Planet, he assembled all of his friends from his glory days in early Capcom history.  All his pals that spent those lonely nights developing Megaman 2 with him were all back developing these 360 titles.</p><p>Being of like mind, they designed both Dead Rising and Lost Planet with Megaman in mind.  After they finished the game engine, the lead developer came to Inafune and said, "my work is done.  we can now bring Megaman to the next generation."</p><p>After hearing this, I was astounded.  This was the main impetus behind developing Lost Planet?  To further refine their next-gen Megaman engine?  Maybe I misjudged this game.</p><p>So.. I set forth to find a copy of Lost Planet and give it a fair shake.  Perhaps I overlooked the love behind the money.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Planet</b></div><p>Lost Planet is about a new planet found by humans to further their exploration in space.  It is a desolate frigid iceberg.  One day while attempting to further their understanding of the planet, Aliens known as the Akrid attack the humans.  "Holy crap!  There's aliens in dem hills"  Humanity gets their ass kicked, but develops mechas known as VS to battle the Akrid.</p><p>Thus, the war between humans and aliens begins.</p><p>You are Wayne.  One of these common workers on the planet, to further mining and expanding the human society on the planet, when a gigantic Akrid attacks and kills off your father.. figure.  When you run away, you're lost in a snow storm in pass out.  Then a girl with huge breasts and a tight outfit despite subzero temperatures finds you, along with this dork and a mysterious scientist.  And you go around and do some missions for them all while finding your purpose in life.</p><p>Typical animu bullshit.  The story is absolutely ridiculous and the plot doesn't make any sense.  For the longest time, you're fighting this organization that wants to terraform the planet, but you keep trying to stop them.  Isn't that the damn point of being on this planet in the first place?!  You want humanity to be able to inhabit this planet.  Why is your goal to prevent this?!</p><p>Eventually you find out that terraforming the planet will kill everything on it.  Well, let's do it.  Light the shit up.  ugh..</p><p>Anyways..  the story really isn't the reason I got the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Gameplay</b></div><p>What's really ironic about this whole experience is the gameplay.  I'm playing this game for the gameplay.  And that is also the most annoying thing about the game.  The annoying story is really only fueled by how annoying the gameplay is, otherwise the story would just be hilariously bad.  Something to jest about.</p><p>Just like my original expression of the gameplay, it is slow, unresponsive and an overall pain in the ass if you want to pull off any sort of precision.  Nearly all bosses require you to fight in a VS, which are incredibly slow.  Jumping takes an extra second to get lift off the ground.  There's no quick movement to dodge away from attacks.  You really have to know the boss strategy and have patience in order to effectively win the game, which doesn't translate in multiplayer at all.</p><p>Pain in the ass.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>What's worse about this game is the single player is the only thing you can do these days.  No one is playing multiplayer because there's better things out there these days.  Everyone is playing Rainbow 6 Vegas or GRAW.</p><p>360 games are such fads.  The media hypes the shit out of them, and everyone is playing when it first comes out.  But 6 months later, the online rooms are vacant.  360 gamers have moved on to their next overly hyped game and playing that multiplayer.</p><p>Of course, the failure of multiplayer for Lost Planet is partly due to the horrible gameplay.  How are you supposed to get all the multiplayer achievement points when you can't play multiplayer?  Gamers are off playing their new game for achievements, and left this game behind.</p><p>People seem to think that the Wii is a fad, but jesus..  How are 360 fps games not a fad?  Gamers move from one game to the next and retailers only retain the cash difference between the New price and the trade-in price.</p><p>This over-saturation is ridiculous.  Their are too many games out, and too many games coming out to justify paying $60 per game.  Honestly, this only decreases the quality of games and makes them "snack-size" rather than something you can really sink your teeth into.  Even Resident Evil 4 I could really sink my teeth into, but it wasn't enough.  It was a 10 hour game.</p><div class='title'><b>Crap</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost Planet is crap.  I'm through kidding myself that this game is something special.  Unfortunately, Inafune, your gameplay is just too annoying.  I wanted to like this game, but playing it just pisses me off.  You can't even beat the final boss, goddammit.</p><p>Don't buy this game and rent other games instead.  The Single player really isn't worth your time.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox Live Recovery" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-live-recovery">Xbox Live Recovery</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The past couple of days have given us some spiffy demos of high profile upcoming Xbox 360 Games.  Such games include Stranglehold, Bioshock, and Beautiful Katamari.</p><p><b>Stranglehold</b> is directed by John Woo and stars Chow Young Fat as hot headed cop, Tequila, on a one man mission to take down the Chinese mafia plaguing the streets of Chicago.  Stranglehold prides itself on being the best stereotypical action-packed cop B movie game there is.  The Demo is pretty much the first level, and you fly through it shooting up Chinese mafia guys.</p><p>After playing through the demo again, I've starting noticing the little things that really make this game shine.  As said above, it prides itself on being stupid and cliche.  As such, you can do numerous amounts of cheesy action moves to kill your foes, which is facilitated by slow-motion gunfire known as Tequila Time.  Whenever you're doing a cheesy action move, and have some Tequilla Time remaining, time will slow down, and you can pull off your shots.  There's also things in the environment to aid you.  You can shoot down Neon signs into enemies, or ignite exploded barrels near enemies.</p><p>The Demo can be pretty fun, but it all gets old pretty quick once you've unlocked all the Tequila Time moves.  Deep down, the game is pretty stupid, and is saved by the fact of how laughable it is.  I don't know why anyone in their right mind would pay full price for this game, let alone, the special collector's editions.  dull.</p><p>Next up, I played the <b>Bioshock</b> demo.  Bioshock is one of the three most anticipating 360 exclusive titles this fall, along with Halo 3 and Mass Effect.  It's also the spiritual sequel to System Shock 1 and 2 for the PC.  Bioshock prides itself on its immersive gameplay and countless game altering decisions made by the gamer, although you see none of this in the Demo.</p><p>The world of Bioshock takes place in Rapture, a Utopian type society underwater away from the world of 1960.  You are Jack, who happens upon this world when your plane crashes into the ocean.  (haha.. lost ripoff).  The world is very stylized in a 1960s feel, too.  Something in the world of Rapture has gone wrong, and find yourself stuck in the middle of a war between the Utopians and the citizens.  When you get in the world of rapture, the first you need to do is defend yourself, so grab that crobar..  i mean, wrench and start bashing away at aliens..  i mean, crazy people.  The intro is very derivative of half-life.</p><p>The similarities between Half-life and Bioshock end there, though, and you move through the falling apart city, searching for a way out, guiding by the guy on the other end of your walkie talkie.  From what people have been saying about the game, the Demo must not give the game much credit at all.  The Demo was actually pretty boring, aside from the 60s style architecture, music, videos..  pretty much 60s everything.  I think renting it would give you a better impression.</p><p>Lastly, i played the <b>Beautiful Katamari</b> demo, which followed the same lines of mediocrity.  Beautiful Katamari offers nothing that isn't present in the previous two or three games.  You roll around, pick up stuff, and beat the level.  The graphics are tighter, but the controls feel a little weird compared to the Playstation... nothing you can't get used to though.</p><p>All in all, these demos are up on the marketplace, so you should check 'em out for yourself.  I'd say that Stranglehold gives you the best impression of what the full game will actually be like.<br/>____</p><p>On the Nintendo side of things, the Metroid preview was updated yesterday, and eluded to some very interesting story elements.  The preview indicated the emergence of the Aurora project, which fused organic brain material into super computers.  These super computers could be of either gender..</p><p>Mother Brain?..  hello</p><p>Their whole month of Metroid marketing plan is beginning to make even more sense now.  Rereleasing the previous Metroid games which actually dealt with Mother Brain as the main villain.  It also gives the impression that these 3 Metroid games are imperative to the overall story of Metroid, and the others were more like side missions.  Not to say that, Metroid 2 wasn't important, but just important enough that Super Metroid can tell you about it.</p><p>It's rather interesting that the Metroid series forms another parallel to the Zelda series by doing this.  I mean, Metroid NES is nothing more than a side-scroller space-themed Legend of Zelda, in the first place.  But the most recent Legend of Zelda gave the impression of what games were actually important in the series, and which ones were merely side stories.</p><p>Twilight Princess basically told me that there are 4 main Legend of Zelda games: Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess.  Will Metroid Prime 3 basically tell me that there are 3 main Metroid games?  Metroid, Super Metroid, and Metroid Prime 3?  I'd like to think they pull Metroid Prime 1 into that list though..</p><p>Anywho, check out the new videos on the Wii.  2 more videos are coming on Thursday. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wii Upgrades" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wii-upgrades">Wii Upgrades</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Wednesday, Nintendo released a firmware upgrade for the Wii which featured a couple of spiffy things.</p><p>1) Wii Store revamp<br/>2) Clock on dashboard<br/>3) Reorder friends in your Address book (thank god)</p><p>but two other things came shuffled underneath the rug that were not documented by Nintendo.</p><p>The Good) Hey, now you can use a USB keyboard when writing messages and a couple other programs.  You can't use it on the Wii Browser, but give 'em a few months.</p><p>The Bad) All Freeloaders are now rendered useless on the Wii.  The freeloader was a legit swap disc used to play any region's Gamecube games.  Very handy for importers.</p><p>I'm not too pissed off about the freeloader.  Nintendo Puzzle Collection is the only worthwhile import.  I suppose someday I'd like to play Giftpia or Doshi the Giant, but those days can wait.<br/>___</p><p>This morning, Nintendo released another little update available for Free in the Shop Channel.  It's Metriod Prime 3 preview featuring two movies and some other stuff.  You can watch the full trailer for the game, and also another video highlighting gameplay?</p><p>It's about time Nintendo got around to doing something comparable to Xbox and Playstation.  The more game videos the better, but it should REALLY include a demo of the game.  Hopefully, they'll do this with Mario Galaxy, Smash Brothers, and Mario Kart, in some way.</p><p>With this preview, Nintendo has dubbed August as the Month of Metroid.  The next 3 Mondays will feature a Metroid release.  August 13th, the original Metroid will be available on Virtual Console.  boring.  August 20th, Super Metroid will be on VC.  I think this is the first time Super Metroid has been re-released.  I will definitely pick that up when I get home from work.</p><p>And August 27th, Metroid Prime 3 will be finally be available.<br/>___</p><p>Fun times on the Wii.  Nintendo is starting to show that they are heading in the right direction, but the Virtual Console, and the Wii in general, NEEDS to have demos in some way.  Sure, I wouldn't have bought Big Brain if i played a demo, but I might pick up another game I'm not expecting.</p><p>The same goes for the DS.  Have a DS Download channel you can download DS demos on.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PSP and PS3 synergy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/psp-and-ps3-synergy">PSP and PS3 synergy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I came across some pretty slick news about the PSP and PS3 the other day, coupled with other upcoming news makes for a very amazing media experience.  Lately, I've been listening to the 1up Yours podcast and one thing that Shane Bettenhausen mentioned is the following:</p><p><em>Once you sync up your PSP and PS3 together, so they recognize each other and have a happy synergy.  When you leave your PS3 turned on and connected to the internet, you can RDC into your PS3 from your PSP from any WiFi connection.  You can't play games, but you can access everything else on the dashboard.  Your movies, your music, the PSN store..</em> (paraphrased)</p><p>This is fricken amazing, especially coupled with the Audio/Video connectivity of the PSP Slim.  You could easily go over to a friend's house, connect to your PS3, and play movies from your PS3 onto your pal's TV.</p><p>This gets even better with the recent rumor that the PS3 will have DVR capabilities and a TV Tuner in the future.  I could record LOST each week, and then easily watch them with Kyle down in Platteville for him to stay current.</p><p>Of course, your connection would have to be premium and stable throughout the transfer.</p><p>___</p><p>What's really weird is that the more I listen to the 1up Yours podcast, the more I get excited about the PS3.  They talk about the PS3 quite a bit.. like THIS IS the next gen.  The don't shove the Xbox under the carpet, but whenever something huge happens with the PS3, they hype the shit out of it..  and honestly, it gets me excited for what's coming on the machine.</p><p>Not excited enough that I would rush and get one, though.  I mean, there's really no reason to at the moment unless you want to blow your cash on fancy beautiful games with no depth.  I'll certainly get one for Metal Gear Solid 4.  I'd also love to play Resident Evil 5 on the PS3...  but Heavenly Sword?  Ratchet & Clank?  I'd rent those before ever considering buying..</p><p>These next few months will be pretty fun without the PS3 anyhow..  At the end of August, we have Phoenix Wright 3 (Japan), Metroid Prime 3, and Brain Age 2.  September, we have the PSP Slim, along with Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core (Japan).  October, we have Zelda Phantom Hourglass.  November, we have Super Mario Galaxy.  I think Nintendo and my backlog of PSP games should keep me busy enough without a PS3.</p><p>Also, once I finish playing Lost Planet, I think i'm going to pick up Tenchu Z.  I liked the demo quite a bit and would be quite interested in playing an immersive game set in a Japanese environment.</p><p>___</p><p>In other spiffy news, my 24 DS Game Wallet pictorial review was featured on the <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/archives/cag-ds-game-case-967-ac-at-penguin-united.php" title="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/archives/cag-ds-game-case-967-ac-at-penguin-united.php">front page of CAG today</a>, highlighting the release of a CAG branded Game Wallet from Penguin United.

| July 31, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The other night, i simply had the itch to download and play some game on the Virtual Console.  I wanted to go back to the past and unearth an old game that i loved playing.  I wanted something with a lot of meat, that I could devote a couple hours towards and actually build something out of my time...  which pretty much eliminated all systems except for the Super Nintendo.</p><p>I perused the selections.  I had a real hankerin' to play Super Metriod, but the Virtual Console had a very surprising few games for the Super Nintendo and even less good ones to choose from.  Actraiser just happened to be at the top of the list (it was alphabetical).  Hot damn do I love this game.  So, in went $8 to virtual land.</p><div class='title'><b>Actraiser, you say..?</b></div><p>Actraiser was either a launch title or a near-launch title for the Super Nintendo here in America.  You basically play god and rid the world of evil monsters giving humanity a chance to develop and grow throughout the land.</p><p>The game is split up into 2 forms of gameplay.  On one hand, your spirit descends to earth and inhabits a Valkyrie statue which you control in side-scroller fashion killing monsters and an ending boss.  After that, on the other hand, your cherub partner floats above the surface as you direct the humans on which direction to expand their city.</p><p>Your level increases when the world reaches certain population milestones.  As the human grow and evolve, they invent tools and things, such as bridges, music, warm clothes, medicines..  You can bring these inventions to other parts of the land which desperately needs advancement.</p><div class='title'><b>Bliss</b></div><p>Actraiser is an absolute pure joy...  and part of what makes it so amazing is the wonderful soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who got his start composing music for the Ys game series.  Looking through his list of soundtracks, I think his most notable soundtrack just happens to be Actraiser.  The music is quite powerful and engaging.</p><p>Other wonderful little tidbits of Actraiser is the sense of advancement in the humans.  Once you initial expel monsters from a region, 2 humans are made and live in the main temple.  When you direct them to build their town, they start off building little tents and huts.  When they become slightly more advanced, they start building little houses out of wood and logs.  When they reach their highest advancement, their homes are quite suited to the environment they live in.  The desert region has stone houses capable of standing up against heavy winds and sands.  The more forest regions have stronger brick houses.</p><p>A lot of love went into this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Overall...</b></div><p>If you have 800 wii points to spend and are looking for a game with a little bit of action, but a lot of building.  Definitely check out Actraiser.  It is truly a gem of the past.</p><p>___</p><div class='title'><b>Elsewise...</b></div><p>After playing Actraiser, I remembered that it was published by Enix, which is now Square Enix, which has openly said that they will NOT be releasing any Virtual Console games.  Maybe they just changed their mind on Enix's properties during the 16-bit era and possibly other titles without the words Final or Fantasy in the title.</p><p>After playing this beautiful Enix title, I actually wanted to get my hands on Illusion of Gaia.  Another game developed by the same team.  I started looking some of this stuff up and Illusion of Gaia actually has several games in the series.</p><p>Apparently Illusion of Gaia is the second game of the series.  Soul Blazer is the first game of the series and appears to present a fantastic link between Actraiser and Illusion of Gaia.  I've never really heard of any of this before, so I'm quite exciting to see that Soul Blazer has the town building aspect of Actraiser, with the top-down action-rpg perspective of Illusion of Gaia.  That's fricken amazing.</p><p>I've never played Soul Blazer before, but if this comes out on Virtual Console, I will buy it that Monday.  I'm somewhat saddened that I hadn't heard of this game until now.</p><div class='title'><b>Wishlist..</b></div><p>Other games that I want to play on Virtual Console include: Illusion of Gaia (SNES), Super Metriod (SNES), Star Tropics (NES), Crusader of the Centy (Genesis), and Snatcher (Sega CD).</p><p>I'd also love to check out Terranigma, which is the sequel to Illusion of Gaia.  Unfortunately, Enix lost its company in America before they were able to bring it over, or else we would have had it.</p><p>Also, I'll probably pick up Zelda: A Link to the Past and Castlevania 4 at some point.  I'll probably make a stupid decision at some point and buy Super Mario Bros, as well.</p><p><em>Edit</em>: Actually, i thought of 2 others games I'd like on Virtual Console: Secret of Mana (SNES) and SD Snatcher (MSX)</p><div class='title'><b>By the way..</b></div><p>In case you're wondering, I have 3 Virtual Console games with the recent purchase of Actraiser.  My other two games are Gunstar Heroes and Sonic the Hedgehog 2<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Condemned" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/condemned">Condemned</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Condemned was one of those premiere games on the 360.  There was other more prominent first person games such as Perfect Dark Zero and Call of Duty, but Condemned was the one that really showcased the 360 graphically.  It was graphically superior to all other launch titles, had a very dark setting, and included its fair share of gore.  My roommate, Tyson, picked it up and I watched him play through the first couple chapters and it seemed like that's all this game was.  Your typical dark, gory first-person game that showcased the 360.</p><p>Today, some people still regard it as one of the 360's top 10 games.  "Is this the same game?" I thought.  "The same game that tries to be scary and edgy, but is really just a hodge-podge of sew together predictable plot devices we've seen in so movies B movies..  This game is a top 10 360 title?"  Well, it just so happens that this launch title was on clearance at Target for a mere $15.  Eh.. why the hell not.</p><p>Well, unfortunately Target didn't have any copies..  In fact, I don't think any of the Targets in Madison actually have any clearance games at all.  I remembered that Gamestop had some sort of sale back in May or June where this game was $20, so I went over there.</p><p>I remember correctly, but they, too, were out of new copies of Condemned.  They had plenty of used copies though for $25.  "What the..?  Is this right?" I asked a nearby employee.  "Yes actually.  We're out of new copies of Condemned, which we sold for $20.  However, we have plenty of used copies..  In fact..  10.. 11.. 12..  We have about 12 copies used for the low low price of $25.  It's really kind of odd.  Apparently suckers, i mean, gamers tend to buy used copies of 360 games more than new copies, so we try to keep a good stock of used games.  In fact, occasionally we open up new copies and mark them as used."</p><p>O_o..  "maybe it's because new copies of most 360 games are $60 which is entirely too high to ask your average gamer to pay for games..  why would i pay $25 for a used copy of the game, when i can buy a new copy of the game for $20?"</p><p>"well..  we're out of new copies of the game."</p><p>"ugh.. whatever, i don't really care.  I just want to give the game a chance."  For some reason, that little voice in head that calls me an idiot took a break.  I could have just rented the game for $8 at blockbuster, or possibly even bought an extremely cheap copy of the game from there too.  Oh well..  my completest collector instincts took over and thought that i'd probably end up liking this game, so i probably want to own it.  (and) Gamestop used copies (which are probably new copies opened up to look like used copies) are in much better condition than a worn out Blockbuster used copy which has had countless diseased hands touching and groping it throughout the past year and a half.</p><p>Well, i suppose i am pretty glad i picked up the game because it's not all bad..  it actually has some very nice points to it, but is riddled with too many annoying things.</p><div class='title'><b>It begins..</b></div><p>You are Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent sent into investigate another serial killing in the futuristic damp dreary setting of Metro City.  The city, itself, is overrun by jacked up thugs whose only release of sweet sweet violence, which has escalated 28 percent in the last year.</p><p>In the abandoned Weisman Office Building, there has been another killing in the Match Maker case.  During the investigation, it just so happens that the killer is still in the building.  In fact, you catch him escaping to the upper floors.  You and your partner take off in opposite directions to capture him.</p><p>This is all going on during the first chapter of the game by the way, so technically these would be spoilers.  Everything in the first chapters sets the story for the rest of the game when the chapters concludes.  You corner the killer, but he over powers you.  Takes your gun.  Kills your partner and a police man.  Then throws you out the window down 4 or 5 stories into a dumpster.</p><p>Bad luck, huh?  Well the bureau happens to think the killer was never present in the building.  They pin the murders of your partner and police officer on you, and you must escape from the law, while solving the crime and catching the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>How to play..</b></div><p>Condemned is your typical first-person shooter-like game, except guns are not your primary weapon of attack.  Melee weapons you can find all over the environment are your main sources of attack.</p><p>Grip #1: You can only have one weapon at a time.</p><p>Most things you can find lying around, you can walk up to and grab using the A button.  (a little icon will appear when you can do this.)  Some weapons are better than others, which you can compare in a little tool tip box that appears in the upper right hand corner.  However, there are some weapons you need in order to progress through the level.  You need a fire-ax to chop through some wooden doors.  A crobar can pry open weapon cabinets.  A shovel can destroy panels of electrically locked doors.  And the good 'ol fashion sledgehammer will break off pad locked doors.</p><p>When you get to a point where you need one of these weapons, you need to drop whatever kickass weapon you may already have.  So i need to drop my sub-machine gun with 20 bullets, to pick up a slow-ass shovel that'll get me into a room with 4 or 5 more enemies.  This is a good idea.  I usually end up running back and picking up the weapon i had before.</p><p>Anyways..</p><p>Combat really isn't all that in-depth.  You have a block and you have an attack.  Blocking attacks give you the opportunity to land quick counter-blows.</p><p>You also have a very handy taser, which conviently stuns enemies long enough to render dead with a shovel and not even have to worry about blocking or combat in general.  Your taser takes a little while to power up though, so you cannot spam enemies with it.</p><p>I usually taser an enemy, grab their weapon from them, and kill them on the next blow with their own weapon.  Then pick up the weapon I dropped and continue on my merry fugitive way.</p><div class='title'><b>Evidence tracking and gathering..</b></div><p>Something Condemned does have going for it is finding and examining evidence.  Hell.. you are a forensics officer.  You have equipment to track blood, take blood samples, look for other clues and take photographs.  You send all this stuff back to your friend at the bureau's lab.  Luckily, she trusts that you are innocent.</p><p>Going around tracking clues is fairly linear though.  There are no side quests where you might find another murder, or solve another crime.  Everything you find builds your case proving your innocence and tracking the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>Graphics..</b></div><p>The other thing condemned actually does have going for it are the overly detailed graphics.  You can really tell that this was the #1 priority for Condemned.  It is certainly one of the prettiest games I have seen on the 360.</p><div class='title'><b>Why do people love this game?</b></div><p>Ultimately though, what really makes this game great is the creepy dark setting.  You never once see daylight in Metro City.  Everything either takes place underground with the absence of light, or outside during nightfall.  Never once does your character experience the sun.</p><p>Hmmm... come to think of it.. this is actually a pretty clever trick to make the graphics artificially feel better.  The game has an incredible amount of detail, but there's no way you could pack this detail in a wide landscape.  I don't think you ever see any more than 40 feet in front of you.</p><p>Anyways, the darkness plays trick on you.  I mean, how is walking around in the dark with a bunch of jacked-up creeps with a taste for blood NOT scary?  And they love to jump out at you when you least expect.  It really keeps you on the edge of your seat and quite entertained, much like Silent Hill or Resident Evil.</p><p>One of the best scenes of the game is the abandoned mall.  by the way, every place that you go to in Condemned is some abandoned building.  An office building, the library, a school, subway station, the mall...  It wouldn't be creepy and full of hostiles if they weren't abandoned, right?</p><p>Anyways, the mall is all decked out for Christmas, but probably last year's Christmas.. or maybe the year before.  Various presents are found across the floor.  Piles of garbage collect in the corner.  Many displays have been shattered with the Mannequins inside beginning to decay.  All the while, you can make out a faint scratchy Christmas song over the intercom to wish you a Merry Christmas.</p><p>This is the fifth chapter in the game, so you've gotten to the point where you are really into the game.  You know how to play and what to expect from the game, but this brings the whole level up a notch.  Especially when you finally come across the enemies.  I won't spoil that..</p><div class='title'><b>The story..</b></div><p>The story itself is alright, but hardly pays off.  It reminds me of Zone of the Enders 1, where this game was meant to start off a whole franchise of story-concluding properties in the future.  I suppose, Matrix 1 was the same way.  "Well crap, we have way too much story to cram into one game.  We can't possibly introduce this world, create a compelling story, and conclude everything we start in one shot.  Let's put out what we have and create the definite game of the series at a later date.  We just need to get this one out now."</p><p>There's something to be said about this style of production.  I mean, how can you cram the entire story of a world into a game and still make it suspenseful and compact?  RPGs have been doing it quite well, but developers are under the impression that the average games does NOT want to spend 40, 60, or 80 hours on a single game.  You think maybe that's because you've stereotyped gamers into ADD children that want nothing but action?</p><p>It does make for a nice compact property though.  One game here, one game there.  Two stories in the same environment.  One that introduces us to the world, and one later that tears down that world and ties up all the lose ends.</p><p>Of course, I feel sorry for the sucker that pays $60 for each game in the series.</p><p>#1 Grip: The biggest absolute worst thing about the game is it's attempt to be linear at the very end.  <em>Spoiler: when you reach the end you are presented with the choice of killing the real killer, or not killing him. </em>  Its a tough decision that the game gives you 5 seconds to make up your mind.  Don't worry though.  Whether you kill him or not, does not change the actual ending.  Stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall, though..</b></div><p>.. Condemned is semi-short game that has some unique characteristics in a very very overdone style.  Do we really need another first person game on the xbox platform?  Is this game good enough that I can say it was well worth it to even produce in the first place?</p><p>Yeah, I guess so.  It definitely has its moments.  But there are so many other better first person games out there I probably should have played first.  I still haven't played Doom 3, or Half-life 2.</p><p>I guess the real test will be the sequel coming out this fall, which was another reason why I wanted to play this game sooner rather than later.</p><p>If Condemned 2 fixes the really annoying things about Condemned 1 and fully explains why the birds were dying and puts closure on the madness that engulfs Metro City..  and its not some stupid retarded explanation..  Then I would say that playing these games isn't a waste of time.</p><p>Condemned, on its own, is okay.  If you like first person games, you'd probably like this.  If you like spooky scary games, you'd probably like this.  If you don't like either of these types of games, then you probably won't like this.</p><p>Overall, i like it..  pretty much for the same reason explained in the 'why people like this game' section of this article.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/22">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/20">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
