| August 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Lost Planet is one of those super-hyped games on the 360 last Christmas season.  Superb Graphics, Superb Gameplay, Superb so forth..  Right before It came out, all the retails had in store demos, and when I played the game, I thought it was just god awful.  The controls felt so slow and inaccurate that I couldn't get any joy out of it.</p><p>Well, the other day, I read an article on 1up from creator Keiji Inafune, who is also the creator of Megaman and Dead Rising.  When creating the game engine for Dead Rising and Lost Planet, he assembled all of his friends from his glory days in early Capcom history.  All his pals that spent those lonely nights developing Megaman 2 with him were all back developing these 360 titles.</p><p>Being of like mind, they designed both Dead Rising and Lost Planet with Megaman in mind.  After they finished the game engine, the lead developer came to Inafune and said, "my work is done.  we can now bring Megaman to the next generation."</p><p>After hearing this, I was astounded.  This was the main impetus behind developing Lost Planet?  To further refine their next-gen Megaman engine?  Maybe I misjudged this game.</p><p>So.. I set forth to find a copy of Lost Planet and give it a fair shake.  Perhaps I overlooked the love behind the money.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Planet</b></div><p>Lost Planet is about a new planet found by humans to further their exploration in space.  It is a desolate frigid iceberg.  One day while attempting to further their understanding of the planet, Aliens known as the Akrid attack the humans.  "Holy crap!  There's aliens in dem hills"  Humanity gets their ass kicked, but develops mechas known as VS to battle the Akrid.</p><p>Thus, the war between humans and aliens begins.</p><p>You are Wayne.  One of these common workers on the planet, to further mining and expanding the human society on the planet, when a gigantic Akrid attacks and kills off your father.. figure.  When you run away, you're lost in a snow storm in pass out.  Then a girl with huge breasts and a tight outfit despite subzero temperatures finds you, along with this dork and a mysterious scientist.  And you go around and do some missions for them all while finding your purpose in life.</p><p>Typical animu bullshit.  The story is absolutely ridiculous and the plot doesn't make any sense.  For the longest time, you're fighting this organization that wants to terraform the planet, but you keep trying to stop them.  Isn't that the damn point of being on this planet in the first place?!  You want humanity to be able to inhabit this planet.  Why is your goal to prevent this?!</p><p>Eventually you find out that terraforming the planet will kill everything on it.  Well, let's do it.  Light the shit up.  ugh..</p><p>Anyways..  the story really isn't the reason I got the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Gameplay</b></div><p>What's really ironic about this whole experience is the gameplay.  I'm playing this game for the gameplay.  And that is also the most annoying thing about the game.  The annoying story is really only fueled by how annoying the gameplay is, otherwise the story would just be hilariously bad.  Something to jest about.</p><p>Just like my original expression of the gameplay, it is slow, unresponsive and an overall pain in the ass if you want to pull off any sort of precision.  Nearly all bosses require you to fight in a VS, which are incredibly slow.  Jumping takes an extra second to get lift off the ground.  There's no quick movement to dodge away from attacks.  You really have to know the boss strategy and have patience in order to effectively win the game, which doesn't translate in multiplayer at all.</p><p>Pain in the ass.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>What's worse about this game is the single player is the only thing you can do these days.  No one is playing multiplayer because there's better things out there these days.  Everyone is playing Rainbow 6 Vegas or GRAW.</p><p>360 games are such fads.  The media hypes the shit out of them, and everyone is playing when it first comes out.  But 6 months later, the online rooms are vacant.  360 gamers have moved on to their next overly hyped game and playing that multiplayer.</p><p>Of course, the failure of multiplayer for Lost Planet is partly due to the horrible gameplay.  How are you supposed to get all the multiplayer achievement points when you can't play multiplayer?  Gamers are off playing their new game for achievements, and left this game behind.</p><p>People seem to think that the Wii is a fad, but jesus..  How are 360 fps games not a fad?  Gamers move from one game to the next and retailers only retain the cash difference between the New price and the trade-in price.</p><p>This over-saturation is ridiculous.  Their are too many games out, and too many games coming out to justify paying $60 per game.  Honestly, this only decreases the quality of games and makes them "snack-size" rather than something you can really sink your teeth into.  Even Resident Evil 4 I could really sink my teeth into, but it wasn't enough.  It was a 10 hour game.</p><div class='title'><b>Crap</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost Planet is crap.  I'm through kidding myself that this game is something special.  Unfortunately, Inafune, your gameplay is just too annoying.  I wanted to like this game, but playing it just pisses me off.  You can't even beat the final boss, goddammit.</p><p>Don't buy this game and rent other games instead.  The Single player really isn't worth your time.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox Live Recovery" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-live-recovery">Xbox Live Recovery</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I made that veggie smoothie and wrote an article on it, packed up a bunch of stuff to bring home this weekend, made some tasty Q'doba like food.  Unfortunately, I was unable to beat Lost Planet, nor did I write an article on how mediocre that game is.  But I did do something that has been pending for quite some time.  I finally recovered my Xbox Live Account and straightened everything out.  It's actually a rather boring story, so I shall spare y'all.

| August 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>The past couple of days have given us some spiffy demos of high profile upcoming Xbox 360 Games.  Such games include Stranglehold, Bioshock, and Beautiful Katamari.</p><p><b>Stranglehold</b> is directed by John Woo and stars Chow Young Fat as hot headed cop, Tequila, on a one man mission to take down the Chinese mafia plaguing the streets of Chicago.  Stranglehold prides itself on being the best stereotypical action-packed cop B movie game there is.  The Demo is pretty much the first level, and you fly through it shooting up Chinese mafia guys.</p><p>After playing through the demo again, I've starting noticing the little things that really make this game shine.  As said above, it prides itself on being stupid and cliche.  As such, you can do numerous amounts of cheesy action moves to kill your foes, which is facilitated by slow-motion gunfire known as Tequila Time.  Whenever you're doing a cheesy action move, and have some Tequilla Time remaining, time will slow down, and you can pull off your shots.  There's also things in the environment to aid you.  You can shoot down Neon signs into enemies, or ignite exploded barrels near enemies.</p><p>The Demo can be pretty fun, but it all gets old pretty quick once you've unlocked all the Tequila Time moves.  Deep down, the game is pretty stupid, and is saved by the fact of how laughable it is.  I don't know why anyone in their right mind would pay full price for this game, let alone, the special collector's editions.  dull.</p><p>Next up, I played the <b>Bioshock</b> demo.  Bioshock is one of the three most anticipating 360 exclusive titles this fall, along with Halo 3 and Mass Effect.  It's also the spiritual sequel to System Shock 1 and 2 for the PC.  Bioshock prides itself on its immersive gameplay and countless game altering decisions made by the gamer, although you see none of this in the Demo.</p><p>The world of Bioshock takes place in Rapture, a Utopian type society underwater away from the world of 1960.  You are Jack, who happens upon this world when your plane crashes into the ocean.  (haha.. lost ripoff).  The world is very stylized in a 1960s feel, too.  Something in the world of Rapture has gone wrong, and find yourself stuck in the middle of a war between the Utopians and the citizens.  When you get in the world of rapture, the first you need to do is defend yourself, so grab that crobar..  i mean, wrench and start bashing away at aliens..  i mean, crazy people.  The intro is very derivative of half-life.</p><p>The similarities between Half-life and Bioshock end there, though, and you move through the falling apart city, searching for a way out, guiding by the guy on the other end of your walkie talkie.  From what people have been saying about the game, the Demo must not give the game much credit at all.  The Demo was actually pretty boring, aside from the 60s style architecture, music, videos..  pretty much 60s everything.  I think renting it would give you a better impression.</p><p>Lastly, i played the <b>Beautiful Katamari</b> demo, which followed the same lines of mediocrity.  Beautiful Katamari offers nothing that isn't present in the previous two or three games.  You roll around, pick up stuff, and beat the level.  The graphics are tighter, but the controls feel a little weird compared to the Playstation... nothing you can't get used to though.</p><p>All in all, these demos are up on the marketplace, so you should check 'em out for yourself.  I'd say that Stranglehold gives you the best impression of what the full game will actually be like.<br/>____</p><p>On the Nintendo side of things, the Metroid preview was updated yesterday, and eluded to some very interesting story elements.  The preview indicated the emergence of the Aurora project, which fused organic brain material into super computers.  These super computers could be of either gender..</p><p>Mother Brain?..  hello</p><p>Their whole month of Metroid marketing plan is beginning to make even more sense now.  Rereleasing the previous Metroid games which actually dealt with Mother Brain as the main villain.  It also gives the impression that these 3 Metroid games are imperative to the overall story of Metroid, and the others were more like side missions.  Not to say that, Metroid 2 wasn't important, but just important enough that Super Metroid can tell you about it.</p><p>It's rather interesting that the Metroid series forms another parallel to the Zelda series by doing this.  I mean, Metroid NES is nothing more than a side-scroller space-themed Legend of Zelda, in the first place.  But the most recent Legend of Zelda gave the impression of what games were actually important in the series, and which ones were merely side stories.</p><p>Twilight Princess basically told me that there are 4 main Legend of Zelda games: Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess.  Will Metroid Prime 3 basically tell me that there are 3 main Metroid games?  Metroid, Super Metroid, and Metroid Prime 3?  I'd like to think they pull Metroid Prime 1 into that list though..</p><p>Anywho, check out the new videos on the Wii.  2 more videos are coming on Thursday. ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wii Upgrades" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wii-upgrades">Wii Upgrades</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>On Wednesday, Nintendo released a firmware upgrade for the Wii which featured a couple of spiffy things.</p><p>1) Wii Store revamp<br/>2) Clock on dashboard<br/>3) Reorder friends in your Address book (thank god)</p><p>but two other things came shuffled underneath the rug that were not documented by Nintendo.</p><p>The Good) Hey, now you can use a USB keyboard when writing messages and a couple other programs.  You can't use it on the Wii Browser, but give 'em a few months.</p><p>The Bad) All Freeloaders are now rendered useless on the Wii.  The freeloader was a legit swap disc used to play any region's Gamecube games.  Very handy for importers.</p><p>I'm not too pissed off about the freeloader.  Nintendo Puzzle Collection is the only worthwhile import.  I suppose someday I'd like to play Giftpia or Doshi the Giant, but those days can wait.<br/>___</p><p>This morning, Nintendo released another little update available for Free in the Shop Channel.  It's Metriod Prime 3 preview featuring two movies and some other stuff.  You can watch the full trailer for the game, and also another video highlighting gameplay?</p><p>It's about time Nintendo got around to doing something comparable to Xbox and Playstation.  The more game videos the better, but it should REALLY include a demo of the game.  Hopefully, they'll do this with Mario Galaxy, Smash Brothers, and Mario Kart, in some way.</p><p>With this preview, Nintendo has dubbed August as the Month of Metroid.  The next 3 Mondays will feature a Metroid release.  August 13th, the original Metroid will be available on Virtual Console.  boring.  August 20th, Super Metroid will be on VC.  I think this is the first time Super Metroid has been re-released.  I will definitely pick that up when I get home from work.</p><p>And August 27th, Metroid Prime 3 will be finally be available.<br/>___</p><p>Fun times on the Wii.  Nintendo is starting to show that they are heading in the right direction, but the Virtual Console, and the Wii in general, NEEDS to have demos in some way.  Sure, I wouldn't have bought Big Brain if i played a demo, but I might pick up another game I'm not expecting.</p><p>The same goes for the DS.  Have a DS Download channel you can download DS demos on.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PSP and PS3 synergy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/psp-and-ps3-synergy">PSP and PS3 synergy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>I came across some pretty slick news about the PSP and PS3 the other day, coupled with other upcoming news makes for a very amazing media experience.  Lately, I've been listening to the 1up Yours podcast and one thing that Shane Bettenhausen mentioned is the following:</p><p><em>Once you sync up your PSP and PS3 together, so they recognize each other and have a happy synergy.  When you leave your PS3 turned on and connected to the internet, you can RDC into your PS3 from your PSP from any WiFi connection.  You can't play games, but you can access everything else on the dashboard.  Your movies, your music, the PSN store..</em> (paraphrased)</p><p>This is fricken amazing, especially coupled with the Audio/Video connectivity of the PSP Slim.  You could easily go over to a friend's house, connect to your PS3, and play movies from your PS3 onto your pal's TV.</p><p>This gets even better with the recent rumor that the PS3 will have DVR capabilities and a TV Tuner in the future.  I could record LOST each week, and then easily watch them with Kyle down in Platteville for him to stay current.</p><p>Of course, your connection would have to be premium and stable throughout the transfer.</p><p>___</p><p>What's really weird is that the more I listen to the 1up Yours podcast, the more I get excited about the PS3.  They talk about the PS3 quite a bit.. like THIS IS the next gen.  The don't shove the Xbox under the carpet, but whenever something huge happens with the PS3, they hype the shit out of it..  and honestly, it gets me excited for what's coming on the machine.</p><p>Not excited enough that I would rush and get one, though.  I mean, there's really no reason to at the moment unless you want to blow your cash on fancy beautiful games with no depth.  I'll certainly get one for Metal Gear Solid 4.  I'd also love to play Resident Evil 5 on the PS3...  but Heavenly Sword?  Ratchet & Clank?  I'd rent those before ever considering buying..</p><p>These next few months will be pretty fun without the PS3 anyhow..  At the end of August, we have Phoenix Wright 3 (Japan), Metroid Prime 3, and Brain Age 2.  September, we have the PSP Slim, along with Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core (Japan).  October, we have Zelda Phantom Hourglass.  November, we have Super Mario Galaxy.  I think Nintendo and my backlog of PSP games should keep me busy enough without a PS3.</p><p>Also, once I finish playing Lost Planet, I think i'm going to pick up Tenchu Z.  I liked the demo quite a bit and would be quite interested in playing an immersive game set in a Japanese environment.</p><p>___</p><p>In other spiffy news, my 24 DS Game Wallet pictorial review was featured on the <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/archives/cag-ds-game-case-967-ac-at-penguin-united.php" title="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/archives/cag-ds-game-case-967-ac-at-penguin-united.php" title="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/archives/cag-ds-game-case-967-ac-at-penguin-united.php">front page of CAG today</a>, highlighting the release of a CAG branded Game Wallet from Penguin United.

| July 31, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>The other night, i simply had the itch to download and play some game on the Virtual Console.  I wanted to go back to the past and unearth an old game that i loved playing.  I wanted something with a lot of meat, that I could devote a couple hours towards and actually build something out of my time...  which pretty much eliminated all systems except for the Super Nintendo.</p><p>I perused the selections.  I had a real hankerin' to play Super Metriod, but the Virtual Console had a very surprising few games for the Super Nintendo and even less good ones to choose from.  Actraiser just happened to be at the top of the list (it was alphabetical).  Hot damn do I love this game.  So, in went $8 to virtual land.</p><div class='title'><b>Actraiser, you say..?</b></div><p>Actraiser was either a launch title or a near-launch title for the Super Nintendo here in America.  You basically play god and rid the world of evil monsters giving humanity a chance to develop and grow throughout the land.</p><p>The game is split up into 2 forms of gameplay.  On one hand, your spirit descends to earth and inhabits a Valkyrie statue which you control in side-scroller fashion killing monsters and an ending boss.  After that, on the other hand, your cherub partner floats above the surface as you direct the humans on which direction to expand their city.</p><p>Your level increases when the world reaches certain population milestones.  As the human grow and evolve, they invent tools and things, such as bridges, music, warm clothes, medicines..  You can bring these inventions to other parts of the land which desperately needs advancement.</p><div class='title'><b>Bliss</b></div><p>Actraiser is an absolute pure joy...  and part of what makes it so amazing is the wonderful soundtrack composed by Yuzo Koshiro, who got his start composing music for the Ys game series.  Looking through his list of soundtracks, I think his most notable soundtrack just happens to be Actraiser.  The music is quite powerful and engaging.</p><p>Other wonderful little tidbits of Actraiser is the sense of advancement in the humans.  Once you initial expel monsters from a region, 2 humans are made and live in the main temple.  When you direct them to build their town, they start off building little tents and huts.  When they become slightly more advanced, they start building little houses out of wood and logs.  When they reach their highest advancement, their homes are quite suited to the environment they live in.  The desert region has stone houses capable of standing up against heavy winds and sands.  The more forest regions have stronger brick houses.</p><p>A lot of love went into this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Overall...</b></div><p>If you have 800 wii points to spend and are looking for a game with a little bit of action, but a lot of building.  Definitely check out Actraiser.  It is truly a gem of the past.</p><p>___</p><div class='title'><b>Elsewise...</b></div><p>After playing Actraiser, I remembered that it was published by Enix, which is now Square Enix, which has openly said that they will NOT be releasing any Virtual Console games.  Maybe they just changed their mind on Enix's properties during the 16-bit era and possibly other titles without the words Final or Fantasy in the title.</p><p>After playing this beautiful Enix title, I actually wanted to get my hands on Illusion of Gaia.  Another game developed by the same team.  I started looking some of this stuff up and Illusion of Gaia actually has several games in the series.</p><p>Apparently Illusion of Gaia is the second game of the series.  Soul Blazer is the first game of the series and appears to present a fantastic link between Actraiser and Illusion of Gaia.  I've never really heard of any of this before, so I'm quite exciting to see that Soul Blazer has the town building aspect of Actraiser, with the top-down action-rpg perspective of Illusion of Gaia.  That's fricken amazing.</p><p>I've never played Soul Blazer before, but if this comes out on Virtual Console, I will buy it that Monday.  I'm somewhat saddened that I hadn't heard of this game until now.</p><div class='title'><b>Wishlist..</b></div><p>Other games that I want to play on Virtual Console include: Illusion of Gaia (SNES), Super Metriod (SNES), Star Tropics (NES), Crusader of the Centy (Genesis), and Snatcher (Sega CD).</p><p>I'd also love to check out Terranigma, which is the sequel to Illusion of Gaia.  Unfortunately, Enix lost its company in America before they were able to bring it over, or else we would have had it.</p><p>Also, I'll probably pick up Zelda: A Link to the Past and Castlevania 4 at some point.  I'll probably make a stupid decision at some point and buy Super Mario Bros, as well.</p><p><em>Edit</em>: Actually, i thought of 2 others games I'd like on Virtual Console: Secret of Mana (SNES) and SD Snatcher (MSX)</p><div class='title'><b>By the way..</b></div><p>In case you're wondering, I have 3 Virtual Console games with the recent purchase of Actraiser.  My other two games are Gunstar Heroes and Sonic the Hedgehog 2<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Condemned" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/condemned">Condemned</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Condemned was one of those premiere games on the 360.  There was other more prominent first person games such as Perfect Dark Zero and Call of Duty, but Condemned was the one that really showcased the 360 graphically.  It was graphically superior to all other launch titles, had a very dark setting, and included its fair share of gore.  My roommate, Tyson, picked it up and I watched him play through the first couple chapters and it seemed like that's all this game was.  Your typical dark, gory first-person game that showcased the 360.</p><p>Today, some people still regard it as one of the 360's top 10 games.  "Is this the same game?" I thought.  "The same game that tries to be scary and edgy, but is really just a hodge-podge of sew together predictable plot devices we've seen in so movies B movies..  This game is a top 10 360 title?"  Well, it just so happens that this launch title was on clearance at Target for a mere $15.  Eh.. why the hell not.</p><p>Well, unfortunately Target didn't have any copies..  In fact, I don't think any of the Targets in Madison actually have any clearance games at all.  I remembered that Gamestop had some sort of sale back in May or June where this game was $20, so I went over there.</p><p>I remember correctly, but they, too, were out of new copies of Condemned.  They had plenty of used copies though for $25.  "What the..?  Is this right?" I asked a nearby employee.  "Yes actually.  We're out of new copies of Condemned, which we sold for $20.  However, we have plenty of used copies..  In fact..  10.. 11.. 12..  We have about 12 copies used for the low low price of $25.  It's really kind of odd.  Apparently suckers, i mean, gamers tend to buy used copies of 360 games more than new copies, so we try to keep a good stock of used games.  In fact, occasionally we open up new copies and mark them as used."</p><p>O_o..  "maybe it's because new copies of most 360 games are $60 which is entirely too high to ask your average gamer to pay for games..  why would i pay $25 for a used copy of the game, when i can buy a new copy of the game for $20?"</p><p>"well..  we're out of new copies of the game."</p><p>"ugh.. whatever, i don't really care.  I just want to give the game a chance."  For some reason, that little voice in head that calls me an idiot took a break.  I could have just rented the game for $8 at blockbuster, or possibly even bought an extremely cheap copy of the game from there too.  Oh well..  my completest collector instincts took over and thought that i'd probably end up liking this game, so i probably want to own it.  (and) Gamestop used copies (which are probably new copies opened up to look like used copies) are in much better condition than a worn out Blockbuster used copy which has had countless diseased hands touching and groping it throughout the past year and a half.</p><p>Well, i suppose i am pretty glad i picked up the game because it's not all bad..  it actually has some very nice points to it, but is riddled with too many annoying things.</p><div class='title'><b>It begins..</b></div><p>You are Ethan Thomas, an FBI agent sent into investigate another serial killing in the futuristic damp dreary setting of Metro City.  The city, itself, is overrun by jacked up thugs whose only release of sweet sweet violence, which has escalated 28 percent in the last year.</p><p>In the abandoned Weisman Office Building, there has been another killing in the Match Maker case.  During the investigation, it just so happens that the killer is still in the building.  In fact, you catch him escaping to the upper floors.  You and your partner take off in opposite directions to capture him.</p><p>This is all going on during the first chapter of the game by the way, so technically these would be spoilers.  Everything in the first chapters sets the story for the rest of the game when the chapters concludes.  You corner the killer, but he over powers you.  Takes your gun.  Kills your partner and a police man.  Then throws you out the window down 4 or 5 stories into a dumpster.</p><p>Bad luck, huh?  Well the bureau happens to think the killer was never present in the building.  They pin the murders of your partner and police officer on you, and you must escape from the law, while solving the crime and catching the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>How to play..</b></div><p>Condemned is your typical first-person shooter-like game, except guns are not your primary weapon of attack.  Melee weapons you can find all over the environment are your main sources of attack.</p><p>Grip #1: You can only have one weapon at a time.</p><p>Most things you can find lying around, you can walk up to and grab using the A button.  (a little icon will appear when you can do this.)  Some weapons are better than others, which you can compare in a little tool tip box that appears in the upper right hand corner.  However, there are some weapons you need in order to progress through the level.  You need a fire-ax to chop through some wooden doors.  A crobar can pry open weapon cabinets.  A shovel can destroy panels of electrically locked doors.  And the good 'ol fashion sledgehammer will break off pad locked doors.</p><p>When you get to a point where you need one of these weapons, you need to drop whatever kickass weapon you may already have.  So i need to drop my sub-machine gun with 20 bullets, to pick up a slow-ass shovel that'll get me into a room with 4 or 5 more enemies.  This is a good idea.  I usually end up running back and picking up the weapon i had before.</p><p>Anyways..</p><p>Combat really isn't all that in-depth.  You have a block and you have an attack.  Blocking attacks give you the opportunity to land quick counter-blows.</p><p>You also have a very handy taser, which conviently stuns enemies long enough to render dead with a shovel and not even have to worry about blocking or combat in general.  Your taser takes a little while to power up though, so you cannot spam enemies with it.</p><p>I usually taser an enemy, grab their weapon from them, and kill them on the next blow with their own weapon.  Then pick up the weapon I dropped and continue on my merry fugitive way.</p><div class='title'><b>Evidence tracking and gathering..</b></div><p>Something Condemned does have going for it is finding and examining evidence.  Hell.. you are a forensics officer.  You have equipment to track blood, take blood samples, look for other clues and take photographs.  You send all this stuff back to your friend at the bureau's lab.  Luckily, she trusts that you are innocent.</p><p>Going around tracking clues is fairly linear though.  There are no side quests where you might find another murder, or solve another crime.  Everything you find builds your case proving your innocence and tracking the real killer.</p><div class='title'><b>Graphics..</b></div><p>The other thing condemned actually does have going for it are the overly detailed graphics.  You can really tell that this was the #1 priority for Condemned.  It is certainly one of the prettiest games I have seen on the 360.</p><div class='title'><b>Why do people love this game?</b></div><p>Ultimately though, what really makes this game great is the creepy dark setting.  You never once see daylight in Metro City.  Everything either takes place underground with the absence of light, or outside during nightfall.  Never once does your character experience the sun.</p><p>Hmmm... come to think of it.. this is actually a pretty clever trick to make the graphics artificially feel better.  The game has an incredible amount of detail, but there's no way you could pack this detail in a wide landscape.  I don't think you ever see any more than 40 feet in front of you.</p><p>Anyways, the darkness plays trick on you.  I mean, how is walking around in the dark with a bunch of jacked-up creeps with a taste for blood NOT scary?  And they love to jump out at you when you least expect.  It really keeps you on the edge of your seat and quite entertained, much like Silent Hill or Resident Evil.</p><p>One of the best scenes of the game is the abandoned mall.  by the way, every place that you go to in Condemned is some abandoned building.  An office building, the library, a school, subway station, the mall...  It wouldn't be creepy and full of hostiles if they weren't abandoned, right?</p><p>Anyways, the mall is all decked out for Christmas, but probably last year's Christmas.. or maybe the year before.  Various presents are found across the floor.  Piles of garbage collect in the corner.  Many displays have been shattered with the Mannequins inside beginning to decay.  All the while, you can make out a faint scratchy Christmas song over the intercom to wish you a Merry Christmas.</p><p>This is the fifth chapter in the game, so you've gotten to the point where you are really into the game.  You know how to play and what to expect from the game, but this brings the whole level up a notch.  Especially when you finally come across the enemies.  I won't spoil that..</p><div class='title'><b>The story..</b></div><p>The story itself is alright, but hardly pays off.  It reminds me of Zone of the Enders 1, where this game was meant to start off a whole franchise of story-concluding properties in the future.  I suppose, Matrix 1 was the same way.  "Well crap, we have way too much story to cram into one game.  We can't possibly introduce this world, create a compelling story, and conclude everything we start in one shot.  Let's put out what we have and create the definite game of the series at a later date.  We just need to get this one out now."</p><p>There's something to be said about this style of production.  I mean, how can you cram the entire story of a world into a game and still make it suspenseful and compact?  RPGs have been doing it quite well, but developers are under the impression that the average games does NOT want to spend 40, 60, or 80 hours on a single game.  You think maybe that's because you've stereotyped gamers into ADD children that want nothing but action?</p><p>It does make for a nice compact property though.  One game here, one game there.  Two stories in the same environment.  One that introduces us to the world, and one later that tears down that world and ties up all the lose ends.</p><p>Of course, I feel sorry for the sucker that pays $60 for each game in the series.</p><p>#1 Grip: The biggest absolute worst thing about the game is it's attempt to be linear at the very end.  <em>Spoiler: when you reach the end you are presented with the choice of killing the real killer, or not killing him. </em>  Its a tough decision that the game gives you 5 seconds to make up your mind.  Don't worry though.  Whether you kill him or not, does not change the actual ending.  Stupidest thing I have ever heard in my life.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall, though..</b></div><p>.. Condemned is semi-short game that has some unique characteristics in a very very overdone style.  Do we really need another first person game on the xbox platform?  Is this game good enough that I can say it was well worth it to even produce in the first place?</p><p>Yeah, I guess so.  It definitely has its moments.  But there are so many other better first person games out there I probably should have played first.  I still haven't played Doom 3, or Half-life 2.</p><p>I guess the real test will be the sequel coming out this fall, which was another reason why I wanted to play this game sooner rather than later.</p><p>If Condemned 2 fixes the really annoying things about Condemned 1 and fully explains why the birds were dying and puts closure on the madness that engulfs Metro City..  and its not some stupid retarded explanation..  Then I would say that playing these games isn't a waste of time.</p><p>Condemned, on its own, is okay.  If you like first person games, you'd probably like this.  If you like spooky scary games, you'd probably like this.  If you don't like either of these types of games, then you probably won't like this.</p><p>Overall, i like it..  pretty much for the same reason explained in the 'why people like this game' section of this article.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/resident-evil-4-wii-edition">Resident Evil 4 - Wii Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Yesterday, I finally spent the chance to play more of Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, which came out about a month ago.  Some regard Resident Evil 4 as the best game of the last generation and I definitely agree that it's quite amazing.  With the Wii controls, better graphics than previous versions, and all the Extra bonus content, the Wii Edition proves itself as the definitive copy of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>About a month ago...</b></div><p>Man, I remember it like yesterday..  I had just moved into the new place, I made frequent posts on my blog..  That Tuesday, I stopped by Shopko looking for Resident Evil, but it was no where to be seen.  I got to my car and called a few places, all which indicated they would receive the game the next day.</p><p>After work the next day, I wasn't really in any rush.  I went out to Token Creek and played a round before stopped off at East Towne's Best Buy where I came into quite a shock.  "Hey my friend, do you guys get in Resident Evil 4 on the Wii?"  "We certainly did, consumer.  We had this entire rack over here filled up," the blue shirted employee explained as he gestured over to the now empty rack in the Wii section.  "guh!?  You guys are sold out?"  "undoubtedly"..</p><p>Crap..  I didn't take into account the popularity of this game.  It must've been advertised well.  "ummm...  well, does your West Towne store have any copies?"  A few brief moments of checking the computer revealed 3 copies remaining at the Best Buy near my house.  "Hot damn!  Thanks for the tip," as i rushed out of the store and into my car.</p><p>I guess this is what passes for adrenaline pumping, emotion driven task completion in my somewhat mundane boring life.</p><p>Thanks to the excruciating slow and dumb driving by the good people of Madison, WI, I did eventually reach the West Best Buy.  I frantically searched on the game shelves but found nothing until I checked one of the end-caps.  Huzzah..  It would seem that I have acquired the last copy at this location.  Ahhh.. that's a good feeling.</p><p>Anywho.. I spent the rest of the night playing it.  And also a good chunk of the weekend.  I beat the game once, and then proceeded through a second time earning money for the infinite rocket launcher.  I stopped at the point when I finally got it.</p><p>But as the week began, I got caught up in other things, and never really got back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Wii Gameplay</b></div><p>Resident Evil 4 is quite an amazing game and makes brilliant use of the Wii controls.  I find myself comparing this port against the other greatest game on the gamecube to receive a Wii port: Zelda - Twilight Princess.  I hated the Wii port of Twilight Princess.  The two things I absolutely hate about the Zelda Wii controls is un-precise sword controls and no camera control.  Both these are absolute non-issues for Resident Evil 4.</p><p>The Wii Controls add an amazing amount of attacking precise you use guns, rather than a sword.  Shooting a "Zombie" in the head could not be simpler.</p><p>The lack of camera is a non-issue because the game operate on a fixed camera to begin with, which lends itself perfectly for aiming and firing.</p><p>The gameplay was quite solid to begin with, but adding the extra precision of the Wii mote aiming brings it to a whole new level.  It's tough going back to FPSes on the 360 after playing Resident Evil 4.</p><div class='title'><b>Confession</b></div><p>This is the first time i've played Resident Evil 4, so it's not easy to draw the distinction between liking the game in the first place, or liking the game on the Wii.  So many people out there love Zelda on the Wii, but I think thats because they never got a chance to play the gamecube version.  When you fall in love with something, you grow loyalty towards that first initial experience and alike subsequent experiences won't measure up.</p><p>Some CAGers say they're in love with the Wii version of Resident Evil, despite playing through the Gamecube or Playstation 2 versions, but I'm not so sure I would be.  I have enough games I haven't played yet, to start playing a new version of something i had.</p><p>In that respect, I'm quite glad to have put off RE4 until now.  I'm also glad I played through Gamecube Twilight Princess before the Wii version.  Twilight Princess Wii is so gimmicky.</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>I do love this game quite a bit, and as mentioned earlier, I'm not the only one.  There are several things that bug me about the actual game design that would never have me saying, "greatest game ever"..  or even "greatest resident evil ever"</p><p>The gameplay, itself, is top notch.  Maybe that's why everyone is all about this game.  Resident Evil was in serious need of a gameplay revamp.  How stupid is a game where you can't even tell what exactly you're aiming at.  This problem reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 1.  For MGS2, they added in a first person view when firing your gun.  MGS1 did have some first person views, which is easily accomplished when all of your levels are 3D.  Resident Evil held onto the pre-rendered backgrounds a little too long, and in typical Capcom fashion pumped out a good 2 or 3 sequels before thinking about what they were doing.</p><p>That's all water under the bridge now, right?  Resident Evil 4 feels like a completely new game.  So much so, in fact, it doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game.  They made an action game out of an adventure series.  They even split up the game into bite-sized level and sub-level chunks.  It's kinda like mario, you begin on stage 1-1.</p><p>Instead of finding yourself in an expansive area with some doors locked and other doors unlocked and you find keys to these doors, and solve puzzles to open others...  You find yourself on a linear path for point A to point B with very little exploration..  it's all about killing the zombies.</p><p>For a Resident Evil standpoint, it is disappointing.  You can't really take it at face value either with the number 4 in the title.  It's part of a series.  Being so, it should follow more than just the overall story, it should follow the feel as well.</p><p>Honestly, I still think the best Resident Evil is #2, with #1 as second.  Resident Evil 4 is amazing, but it's a Leon side-story.</p><div class='title'><b>Speaking of story...</b></div><p>Why are Resident Evil games getting more ridiculous?  Code Veronica made Claire into some kind of super hero, and the main boss was a cross-dressing psychopath.  In Resident Evil 4, Leon is also some kind of super hero was precise knife-handling skills and fast reflexes.  Does initial contact with Zombies make you that much better?  I suppose, you'd probably work out quite a bit for fear of the next impending Zombie disaster.</p><p>meh..</p><p>Part of what makes Resident Evil 1 and 2 so eerie is how down to earth you feel.  You feel like regular people trying to survive.  Regular people with guns, of course.</p><p>I hope Resident Evil 5 really brings back what it means to find yourself in a weird mysterious place in the heart of a Zombie outbreak.  An actual entire town would be fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>Segway</b></div><p>Now don't get me wrong..  if you haven't played Resident Evil 4, definitely pick it up.  It is one of best games of the last generation, and, currently, is the best game on the Wii.  You will not find a better, more affordable complement to your Wii library.</p><p>In fact, you probably won't find it because Stores have been sold out since that initial release.</p><p>Thanks to Resident Evil 4, I cannot wait for Metriod Prime ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Earth Defense Force" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-earth-defense-force">The Earth Defense Force</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Finally, the reason to own a 360 is here.  I picked this game up about a month and a half ago, and haven't really put it down since.</p><p>In EDF, the alien invasion has begun, and they've unleashed hordes of mutated gigantic ants, spiders and massive mechanical robots.  Luckily, a few years prior to the alien invasion earth setup a defense force just in case such things would occur.</p><p>You play a lowly pion in the army, and choose from over 150 unlockable weapons to completely eradicate every enemy in sight.  There's really no story, no plot twists or character plots to get in the way of blowing the shit out of robots, gigantic insects and UFOs.</p><p>It's fricken awesome.  "Oh my god.. Ants are crawling up the sides of Tokyo. Blow them the fuck up.  Oh shit, here comes more.  Damn!  Spiders.  Holy crap!  Robots shooting lazers up my ass..  reload reload goddammit..  blow it up..  die!"  Building are completely destructible as well, so firing a rocket into a horde of ants 5 stories up with demolish that business.</p><p>It's really nicely detailed too..   Most large buildings has convenience stores on them actually modeled after REAL convenience stores.  There's a Lawsons, Daily Yamazaki, and others!  Rad-tastic</p><p>____</p><p>Something I just noticed today, though, is that this is actually a remake of the PS2 game which came out back in 2003.  Simple Series Number 31.</p><p>Luckily, Japan never frowns on bad games being made..  they actually encourage it.  Simple Series is a publisher that pretty much publishes games on concept alone, regardless of the end product, and releases it at a budgeted price tag.  Concepts like "a maid versus the mafia", "a bikini clad warrior out to kill zombies", "collecting infected humans in an ambulance before they turn into zombies", or simply.. "defending the earth against gigantic ants and spiders"</p><p>The Simple Series can be found on PS2, PSP and DS..  maybe PS1 as well.  Though, some of these games actually sell pretty good and get sequels and ports to next-gen machines.  Such as the case with EDF.</p><p>Something else I learned today is that 2 years ago, Sandlot made Earth Defense Force 2 (Simple Series #81) and one year ago, they made Earth Defense Force Tactics (Simple Series #103)..  Both these two games come out in Europe today.</p><p>____</p><p>Anyways.. if you own a 360, you owe it to yourself to play Earth Defense Force.  It was released as a budgeted title at $40, but you could rent it just the same. ^_^</p><p>Here's hoping we'll be seeing Earth Defense Force 2 on the 360 in the future.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/22">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/20">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
