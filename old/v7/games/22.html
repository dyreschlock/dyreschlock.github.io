| June 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, I spent a fair amount of time downloading a bunch of demos for the 360 that seemed pretty interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Project Silpheed</b></div><p>This is Squaresoft's first 360 game, so I had to give it a go.  Project Silpheed, not to be confused with the real Silpheed game series, and a 3D chase-view shmup set in space, kinda like Descent or Colony Wars.  You basically fly around and blow shit up.. just like any shmup.  The controls are so goddamn intricate, spending half an hour going through the tutorial is almost required.  In fact Penny Arcade did a <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/06/08" title="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/06/08">comic</a> on it.</p><p>On top of that, the game really isn't all that fun.  It's more of a chore to fly around and pick off all the enemy planes..  only to get killed in 3 direct hits by one lucky fellow.  Pass</p><div class='title'><b>Tenchu Z</b></div><p>Tenchu is probably one of my favorite games of all time.  In its core, it wasn't a particularly good game.  The gameplay on its own is nearly passable and was largely over shadowed by Metal Gear Solid at the time.  The AI of the enemies was dumb..  You could stand next to them and they detect you.  BUT the music was simply beautiful.  It has one of the must in-depth, powerful, and simply stunning soundtracks of any Playstation title.</p><p>There have been many sequels to Tenchu, but none have captured the essence of the original.  All have been shitty buggy clones with crappy music.  Why can't they just get the original composer's back and bring the franchise back to its glory days...?</p><p>Anyways, I saw the demo on Xbox Live and gave it a go.  Tenchu is a stealthy ninja game, where you kill your enemies without being detected.  You can grappled on top of buildings, jump down behind your enemy, and cut him open without him seeing you.</p><p>Tenchu Z actually surprised me a bit.  I felt like a was brought into the past and playing Tenchu for the first time again.  Everything seemed largely the same.  Scaling rooftops, dumbass easy-to-kill AI..  But it is missing two big things for me to fall completely in love: The music and the wicked.  The music in the demo is soft, subtle and boring, which means you never pay attention to it, which means it doesn't engross you into the environment.  Music will pull and guide you into any world the game or movie present.  I would put sound on par with anything sight can do..  So to completely fail at any auditory is a huge blow to the over all experience of the game.</p><p>The other thing the <b>demo</b> fails at is the overall wicked-ness of the original Tenchu.  Like with the skeleton baby cult, and lust for crazy fat people.  This is just a demo, so there's no way they'd get into any of the this stuff just yet..  Hopefully they will..  I'd be disappointed if there wasn't.</p><p>So...  if you've got a 360 and loved Tenchu back in the day, why not check it out.  It's certainly not as good as the original, but it's not too bad.  The demo said that the full game has 50+ missions in it, and plenty of customizable outfits, faces, and weapons.  It's been 9 years since the original came out..  relive the magic in its beaten up, broken down form.</p><p>I'll probably pick it up, if I could find it for $40.  $60 is way too much for this game..</p><p>Edit: Crap.. Tenchu Z just came out this week..  finding it for less than $60 will be difficult..  maybe i'll rent it.</p><div class='title'><b>DiRT</b></div><p>DiRT is a rally racing game which stole NiGHTS' and SiCKO's capitalization styles. The demo has a very arcade style of selecting cars and tracks.  Unlike the convoluted, over customization of Gran Turismo and Forza motorsports, You pick your car, pick your track, and away you go.  This is probably a little different in the actual game.</p><p>The graphics are simply beautiful.  Highly detailed cars, environments, etc..  What's really amazing in the damage you inflict on your car.  The slightest scratch or bump will change the appearance of your car and when you slam into a side-rail..?  Blam!  The front of the car is scrunched accordion style, while the hood is slightly torn up.  The side-rail has a huge dent in it next at the point of impact.</p><p>The damage is quite realistic, and sounds are so blunt and powerful..  It's hard to not have fun beating the shit out of your car.  Bushes, actually have mass too, and can scrape out your nice fine finish.  I've never seen a game take damage to the environment as seriously as taking damage to the car.</p><p>The thing I love about this game the most though, is the menu navigation.  I should really get some sort of screenshoting software to explain it.  It's a 2D menu in a 3D space..  kinda like the Wipeout Fusion menu, except when you select something, you fly around space to the next menu.  Each menu has a reflective text, so it shimmers in the light when you move across it.</p><p>Anyways, DiRT is a lot of fun despite being developed by codemasters, who special in making sub-par games.  It comes out this week for the 360, and in a couple of months for the PS3.  Definitely a rent title, but I would probably pick it up for $40 on the PS3 if there wasn't anything else going on at that time.</p><p>____</p><p>Huzzah.. fun times all around.  Definitely download these demos to see for yourself..  Especially the DiRT demo.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Big Brain Academy impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/big-brain-academy-impressions">Big Brain Academy impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week, <b>Big Brain Academy</b> joins the ranks of Cooking Mama and Trauma Center as another DS title remade and ported to your television.  And much like Cooking Mama and Trauma Center, it is identical to the DS title with minor tweaks, changes and multi-player modes added.</p><p>Today I finally broke down and picked it up.  Knowing that $50 is way too damn much for this game..  Knowing there are only 15 mini-games in this whole package..  After checking blockbuster each day hoping they'd have it..  After keeping myself away from Best Buy, Shopko, and all those other places where I'd be tempted to purchase it..  Even after telling myself over and over again that I can just wait a week and Resident Evil 4 will be out on the Wii..  After all that..  I caught a thread on Cheap Ass Gamer, stating it was $40 this week at Circuit City.  and.. I came across an article which said I could get a free Wii-mote keychain.  So whatever..  I picked it up.</p><p>Bad Choice.</p><p>Big Brain Academy boasts its depth in bulking up and building your brain, but offers the most shallow presentation, gameplay, and overall quality on the Wii alongside Wii Play.</p><p>For single player modes you have training and practice.  With training, you delve through 5 areas of focus with 10 puzzles each.  For each area a weight is calculated to determine how massive your brain is.  These are totaled up and kept track of.  Sounds like fun eh?  As some of my old roommates said, "wow..  it's like they made a game based off of school that's actually as boring as school."</p><p>You also have practice mode where you can go through each area one by one, on any difficulty and get bronze, silver, gold or platinum medals for your successes.</p><p>Multiplayer has 3 different modes that use all these same games.</p><p>And... that's it.  I'm already fricken bored of it.  It does have a little connectivity online, but that's only to compare your brain's weight to others in your Wii address book.</p><p>Much like the DS titles, it seems like this is the type of game you play for 15 to 30 minutes a day and improve your brain's capacity.  That works great for the DS because it's a portable system.  It's designed for pick-up, play and put-away type games like this.  The Wii is a home console..  people don't spend full price on a snack size game when they expect a full meal.</p><p>Honestly, so far the Wii library has done a horrible job at making an actual compelling game to sink time into..  Luckily they ported Twilight Princess, so you can throw that argument back in my face.</p><p>Anyways, why didn't they just forget about the multiplayer, beef up the online connectivity, and release this as a $20 downloadable channel in Shop Channel?  It seems like such a waste to have this tiny game on an entire disc..  If I'm only going to spend 10 or 15 minutes playing it, I don't want to have to switch discs every single time.  I want it easily accessible like the 'Everyone Votes' channel.  Would you spend $50 for that?</p><p>If you really want to play this game, I suggest you rent it..  If you really want to buy it, though..  wait until it's $20.. or hell..  you could just buy it off me.  I already registered it for the Wii-mote key chain though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to This just in: PSP Slim Data" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/this-just-in-psp-slim-data">This just in: PSP Slim Data</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/rumor/psp-slim-details-revealed-267108.php</p><p>Kotaku has come across some more details of the PSP Slim</p><p>- sharper screen<br/>- smaller screen<br/>- extended battery life<br/>- faster UMD drive for shorter load times<br/>- 8 gigs internal flash memory<br/>- revamped buttons</p><p>- no dual analog stick, though<br/>- no touchscreen (like it needs one)<br/>- probably no built-in camera</p><p>- official unveiled at E3<br/>- probably around $170<br/>- end-august / september release date</p><p>The loading times have been my greatest turn off of the PSP, right behind the fragility of the piece.  It never seemed like tugging that piece of equipment around with actually practical.</p><p>The other initial problem with the machine were the Games.  I think it has gotten to the point where there are some pretty fun games on the system warranting a purchase.  Games like:</p><p>- Lumines I/II<br/>- Every Extend Extra<br/>- Loco Roco<br/>- Wipeout Pure/Pulse<br/>- Metal Gear Solid OPs<br/>- new Silent Hill<br/>- Final Fantasy VII-2</p><p>and also</p><p>- Gradius Collection<br/>- Parodius Collection<br/>- IQ Mania<br/>- Valkyrie Profile<br/>- some NIS games<br/>- and that puzzle/rhythm game Tony always talks about</p><p>I've been waiting for a reason to pick up a PSP and looks like it's finally arrived..  This is pretty similar to when the DS Lite was announced for me.  Day one Japanese purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to This day in Nintendo" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/this-day-in-nintendo">This day in Nintendo</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Graphics</b></div><p>New York is the center stage for the end of humanity.  Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast-2">End Gen Dreamcast (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Karous</b></div><p>Karous was released in February 2007. I found this game on my latest trek back to Japan in my local new/used gaming store. They actually had a couple copies of the game, and one copy used for $45. I did think it over long and hard whether i should buy this game.. It is developed and self-published by Milestone, who also made Radilgy and Chaos Field. Chaos Field was actually a rather fun game, and Radilgy looked pretty crazy.. so, by association, i laid down my 4500 yen.</p><p>Karous is a very minimalist styled shooter through and through.  The graphics are cell-shaded and drenched in deep dark blues, greens and greys, but complemented with other over-used bright white.  It probably looked like a good idea on paper, but in execution looks very unfinished.  When you use cell-shading, you must be very aware of shapes and forms and how shadows well bring out the simplistic complexity of your subject.  I think cell-shading is a horrible medium for shooters because you have no time to soak in the subtleties and models are going to be too tiny to see any detail.</p><p>Unfortunately they carry this throughout each level like a dead horse.  I don't know if they re-use the same environments, but each stage looks exactly the same..  I really can't tell the difference.  All the enemies have the same grayscaled colors, so the bosses really can't be distinguished from each other easily.</p><p>The game does not scale very well either.  I can hardly see what the hell is going on with the game on my TV.  In Yoko mode, you can't even see what level your weapons are at.  Tate mode really isn't all that much better either.  Aliasing abound!</p><p>Anyways, the minimalistic theme continues into the music.  The soundtrack features plenty of broken drumming, chimes, and lack of melody that produces very experimental sounds.  It's a very different approach to a shooter OST and i'm not really sure that it works out for them.  You have no sense of suspense or thrill when playing levels..  It really ends up bothering me more than pulling me in.</p><p>The gameplay works very similar to Chaos Field.  You have 3 buttons..  One for shoot, one for bombs, and one for sword.  Also, when you stop shooting you have a shield which is automatically deployed.  Each of these attacks have a separate color.  (Green for sword, Blue for shot, Red for bomb, and Yellow for Shield.)  When you hit an enemies, they'll shimmer in the color of which weapon they are weakest against.  Most shimmer in Red, but you'll get the occasional green or yellow.</p><p>Each of your weapons can be powered up through use or grabbing power-ups.  These power-ups usually come from drones of like enemies, or big ass enemies.  You'll usually get a little blue triangle which you can smack a couple times with your sword to power-up.  Also, i think just general firing and killing powers up your bomb.</p><p>Overall, this game is challenging, but i'd only recommend it as a last resort.  The graphics are actually pretty bad, and the music doesn't complement the gameplay well.  It's actually kind of annoying to play..  I guess i now know the reason why Tom Sawyer had so many copies of the game..  Oh well...  the gameplay does have some redeeming qualities.</p><div class='title'><b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b></div><p>Exelica is the most recent Dreamcast game which came up March 2007. Purple Godzilla in Seattle, WA showcased this game at Sakura-Con and had it for a very fair price of $65, considering it was nearly identical to the Japanese price of 6500 yen. I had seen Exelica in Japanese arcades before, and #five actually played a bit too. The gameplay looked very different than your normal shmup, so i figured, hell, i'd give it a shot.</p><p>In Trigger Heart Exelica, you play Exelica or Crueltear, two anime girls out to save or defeat their friend or foe.  You wage war against an onslaught of futuristic space ships in your flying power armor.  The game reminds me a lot of Shikigami no Shiro for some reason, even though the two games are completely different.  Massive points are obtained through collecting gold pieces from destroyed enemies and fire.</p><p>You have 3 attacks: normal fire, bombs and grapple.  Exelica and Crueltear have different shoot waves..  Exelica is rather spread out, while Crueltear's is straight on.  Bombs are as standard as ever.</p><p>The grapple technique is what makes this game so unique.  You can grapple nearly any enemy on the screen.  Bigger enemies will take a little longer..  Once you've captured them, they will shield you from oncoming bullets, and you can also smash them into enemies for massive points and damage.  When you move back and forth while holding an enemy, you'll swing back and forth..  swinging the enemy all the way around you will put you into a spin that'll almost shield you completely against enemy fire.  When you let go, the enemy goes flying and it's explosion destroys everything in the immediate area.</p><p>This makes some impossible to dodge areas essential for using the grapple technique.  There's one particular part in Stage 3 where the entire screen is jam packed with enemies..  you can't even get around them.  Not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of bullets..  Grappling one enemy and tossing him in the center of all that mess will clean out a lot of your obstacles.</p><p>The graphics are pretty decent.  They aren't crazy mind blowing graphics, but they are certainly don't suck.  The music also compliments the game quite well.  Unfortunately the sounds could use a lot more bass.  Blowing up things is MUCH more satisfying with a sound that you can feel in your body.</p><p>Overall, this game is pretty fun, albeit spinning around while grappling an enemy can be difficult to get the hang of.  A little nick picky thing that i don't really like is that you start off with infinite credits, rather than eventually unlocking more over time.  Starting off with only a set amount of credits will inspire you to get better at the game, and eventually push yourself to greatness.  Having the whole game laid out to you on your first sitting is very unrewarding.</p><p>$65 is a very steep price for this game though.  That money would be better spent on Under Defeat.  If you came across this game in an arcade, i'd definitely recommend a few coins of play to see if you like it.</p><div class='title'><b>The tears of the ages...</b></div><p>Unfortunately, this is the end of the Dreamcast.  As of February this year, Sega has officially stopped all production of the GD-Rom medium, and 2 week ago, declared that on September 28th, 2007, Dreamcast Repair Services will cease completely.  The Dreamcast lasted nearly 9 years in the marketplace...  not too many consoles can say that.  Of course, those companies have bigger better projects to focus on.</p><p>This doesn't spell demise for the Naomi boards..  In fact, Triangle Service is currently developing their latest shmup, Exzeal, for the Naomi cabinets and set to be released this year.  Triangle Service had previous released Trizeal in 2005 for the Dreamcast.  This doesn't guarantee a Dreamcast release though..  Trizeal has been ported over to Ps2 for a wider audience.</p><p>G.rev's most recent game, Senko no Ronde, was also Naomi GD-Rom, but was remade and updated for home release on the Xbox 360, which is coming to the US next month thanks to Ubi Soft.  Senko no Ronde is shmup fighter hybrid type game.</p><div class='title'><b>Since Naomi<br/></b></div><p>Though Naomi development still goes on with 3rd party Arcade developers, Sega has moved on.  Not that long after Naomi originally debuted, Sega released the Naomi 2 in 2000.  Naomi 2 was a beefed up Naomi board with more better everything.  Though, with the pending death of the Dreamcast, Sega began focusing on other hardware.</p><p>Namco had already taken a cue from Sega, and had partnered with Sony to release Playstation-like hardware in the Arcades..  With console sales heading the gaming industry, Sega looked to the other consoles for Arcade hardware.</p><p>In 2002, Sega released the Chihiro hardware based on the Xbox.  Sega made a few changes though by scrapping the DVD-Rom drive for a GD-Rom drive, and make the RAM expandable for upgrades.  They also made full use of the communication capabilities of the Xbox and developed a slew of networkable titles.  These games you could play against anyone else in an Arcade across Japan.</p><p>Sega continued with their idea of making porting games easy from Arcade to Xbox and Xbox to Arcade.. Unfortunately, the Memory upgrades were used heavily in the Arcade which made scaling games to the home unit difficult.  Wikipedia points out that Outrun 2 used 512mb memory in the arcade, while the Xbox had only 64mb to work with.</p><p>Also in 2002, Sega has teamed up with Namco and Nintendo to release the Triforce Arcade hardware.  Partnership and development centered around the Nintendo Gamecube hardware and the release of F-Zero AX/GX, one of my favorite games of all time.  This was also a good opportunity for Nintendo to get some market share in the Arcades again..  Aside from F-Zero, Mario Kart GP is the other notable release for this hardware.  Mario Kart 2 was released early this year.</p><p>I guess the Sega, Namco, Nintendo Triforce partership was the middle ground for all big-name console and arcade hardware developers..  Sega w/ Microsoft, Namco w/ Sony, and Sega/Namco in the middle with Nintendo.</p><div class='title'><b>Turning to the future, PC in 2004</b></div><p>In 2004, Sega released their current Arcade hardware, the Lindbergh.  It was originally going to be based on the Xbox 360, but eventually became PC based instead.  In fact, also in 2004, Taito released their current arcade hardware which is also PC based..  PC based machines offered far more extensibility for upgrades and stacking processors..</p><p>That's kind of the same direction the shmup community has been going as well.  Independently developed PC shmups have really caught the eyes of many circles.  Especially the Toho Project, responsible for Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night.  I haven't played any of these though, unfortunately.</p><p>Anywho.. i guess we'll see where Shmups will find their home in this new generation.  Senko no Ronde is on the 360, Gradius VI is coming out on PS3..  all while the Wii might be the best home with low publishing costs and a very retro community fanbase.  Most shmups these past years have found themselves on the PS2 because of how popular it is, rather than how identical the hardware is to its' original.  I'm sure that'll be the same in the coming years.</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming American Shmup Releases</b></div><p>April 17th.  Raiden III on Playstation 2 for $30<br/>April 27th.  Radilgy (Radio Allergy) on Gamecube for $30<br/>May 22nd.  Senko no Ronde (WarTech) on Xbox 360 for $60 ...  ugh :/<br/>Soon.  Ikaruga on Xbox Live Marketplace.</p><p>... and probably some other ones too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast">End Gen Dreamcast</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On January 31st, 2001, Sega announced that they would discontinue the Dreamcast and would focus on 3rd Party support for other home consoles instead.  The Dreamcast had a very short life which began in November 1998 in Japan, and September 9th, 1999 in America.  In February 2002, NHL 2k2 was the last game released in America..  However, life continues to grow in small reaches thanks its initial purpose and devoted fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallel Arcade Development</b></div><p>The Sega Saturn was really the first instance of Sega developing their home console along-side arcade Hardware.  In 1994, Sega released the Saturn in Japan, alongside their ST-V arcade hardware.  Since the hardware was nearly identical, games arcade games developed for ST-V could be ported near exactly.  Fans could play exact copies of arcade games on their home console.  The other difference was that ST-V arcade units took huge clunky cartridges, while the Saturn took standard CDs.</p><p>The Saturn was initially flawed due to its emphasis on 2D graphics, and last minute 3D graphical additions.  2D games looked amazing, but the populous was captivated by the 3D marvels other consoles and arcade hardware provided.  Sega lost support, but they learned from their mistakes... sort of.</p><p>Sega began development of the Naomi arcade boards, to be far more versatile.  The <b>N</b>ew <b>A</b>rcade <b>O</b>peration <b>M</b>achine <b>I</b>dea was developed with both 2D and 3D in mind.  Boards were set up to process in parallel, so you could just add another board and increase processing power.  (and) Machines were fitted to read from GD-Roms, Sega's proprietary disc format.  GD-Roms were just normal CD-Roms except data was compacted together for optimal storage capacity.  A normal 700mb disc, could hold up to 1.2gb of data.</p><p>This was extremely flexible for the developers..  The could now produce discs to distribute their games, rather than cartridges..  something the console industry had already been doing at this time.</p><p>The Dreamcast is a lone Naomi board, squished into a plastic case, ready for sale to the mass public.  In 1998, Sega released both the Naomi boards and the Dreamcast in Japan.  (and then) The Dreamcast pretty much died in 2002.  Few games released, first party support dropped, and a very healthy alternative: Playstation 2.  However, it was their Naomi boards that continue to spur life on thanks to a healthy underground game genre.</p><div class='title'><b>Shmups</b></div><p>Shmups is an audible abbreviation for Shoot 'em ups, or Shooters.  Such famous shmups include 1941, Defender, Gallaga, Asteroids, Gradius..  Games that involve some sort of airplane or space ship, dodging enemy fire and other obstacles, while shooting up enemies.  Shmups were somewhat mainstream when gameplay and graphics were simply, but began to go underground when mainstream games began to offer more.</p><p>Anyways..  Shmup companies turned to the Naomi boards for their cheap development and production costs, as well as, ease of porting to a home console.  Shmup companies continued to develop Naomi games and subsequently release them on the Dreamcast even after the consoles death.  Since 2003, the Dreamcast has had 9 shmup releases: Shikigami no Shiro 2, Psyvariar 2, Border Down, Chaos Field, Trizeal, Radilgy, Under Defeat, Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica..  as well as some hentai releases.</p><p>These Dreamcast games would not have been possible if not for the Naomi boards and the devoted fans of the Shmup community.  In fact, such after death support began to reach enough demand for Sega to re-release some Dreamcast units in 2006, packaged with Radilgy.</p><p>Most of these after-death titles have been ported to other consoles, and thanks to O3 (Sega's unofficial private US publishing company) some have even come to the states.  Chaos Field was released in America in Feb 2005 on the Gamecube..  Currently, O3 is bringing over Radilgy on Gamecube posed to release at the end of April.  They renamed in Radio Allergy, though</p><div class='title'><b>The Dreamcast lives on..  kinda<br/></b></div><p>Man..  my Dreamcast has seen better days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" /></p><p>One day when I tried playing Crazy Taxi, the disc would scrape along the tray cover.  I took it upon myself to fix this problem..  so I took off the case, tightened some screws, and reassembled it.  Well...  the CD had plenty of room to spin around, but the Dreamcast always thought the tray was open.  When I reassembled it, the tray no longer hit the little lever in the back :/  Nothing a little tape won't fit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" /></p><p>To play import games on my Dreamcast, i need a boot disc.  Something that took about 5 minutes of googling, and another 5 minutes of burning to accomplish.  When completely screwed together, my Dreamcast thinks the tray is either closed or open..  It can't detect open/close functionality..  So i help it along..  no biggie.  Thus my Dreamcast looks like Dreamcastenstien.  It has life..!  I have given it life..!</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>Throughout my travels across the earth, across the country, and across the internet, I've found myself in the position of purchasing the 3 most recent Dreamcast games:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" /></p><p>Under Defeat, Karous, and Trigger Heart Exelica, in order of release date..  After the Dreamcast Rerelease in 2006, They began publishing games with DVD style cases rather than CD cases.</p><p>So...  Are these games actually worth it?  well... here's what i think:</p><div class='title'><b>Under Defeat (Limited)</b></div><p>Originally released in early 2006, I found this game from <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/" title="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</a>.  I wasn't really sure if i was seeing it correctly, but they actually had copies of the Limited Edition version which came with the soundtrack.  I had heard Under Defeat was an amazing game, so i decided to order it.  Also, i think someone said the Limited version was super crazy rare, so that was also a deciding factor.</p><p>Under Defeat is developed by G.rev, which was founded by several Taito employees who had developed G Darius.  G.rev's notable works include Border Down, also on Dreamcast after its death.  G.rev is also noted for working with Treasure on their development of Ikaruga and Gradius V, two of the best shooters ever made.</p><p>Under Defeat does not disappoint.  You pilot a German attack helicopter in a modern version of World War II.  The helicopter will rotate right and left when you move allowing you to fire at an angle rather than straight on the whole time.  You get 3 bombs to start off with that launch an air strike upon the ground..</p><p>The little bit of innovation comes into, what they call, an option.  When you hold your fire long enough, a little green bar will fill up in the lower left hand corner.  When it flashes OK, you can begin firing again, and you'll release a little pod which will fire upon your opponents.  You can grab other power-ups that will change its weapon: Vulcan, Cannon and Rocket (from weakest and frequent to strongest and less frequent).</p><p>All kills this little guy acquires will net you double points.. and Therein lies the secret to obtaining massive points: Have the option kill as many high point gainers as possible..  especially laying the final blow on bosses.</p><p>The gameplay is very easy to pick up since it is rather basic..  The sounds and graphics add that extra icing on the cake that makes this game great fun.  The game plays 2D, but the graphics are in full 3D featuring rich textures and distinguishable colors and models to make enemies noticable and prominent.  Bullets are pretty easy to spot too.</p><p>Stylistically, smoke and explosions plays a extra role..  Whenever you fire a bullet a little bit of smoke emits from your cannon.  The Bullet flies through the air and hit your target with a little bit of smoke residue.  When enemies die, there's a little bit of pause as its engulfed in flames and bursts from explosion.  The fiery orange sparks from the enemy but is sharply over powered by black smoke.  The smoke stays in the air, and eventually fades away from the sky..   Sometimes, if you aren't heavily shooting up an enemy it'll blow up a little and fall to the earth underneath emitting a smoke trailed descent.  Another explosion results in the impact, with more smoke.</p><p>Under Defeat is an amazing joy to play, albeit just a little bit difficult.  I would definitely recommend any casual fan of the shooter genre to check out this game.  Much like Border Down, it will most likely stay on the Dreamcast, so if you do find a copy online for around $50, that will probably be the cheapest you'll get it for.</p><p>Buy from import retailers who support these companies by buying their products in the first place.  With out community support, we wouldn't even have these games at all.  In fact, Ncsx still has copies of the LE version in stock: http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/T-46704M.html  .. if you're a fan and you have the money, i'd say it's worth it.  Then you can say, "Yes..  i am responsible for the Dreamcast refusing to die."</p><div class='title'><b>More to come...</b></div><p>I'll get my impression of the Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica up in the next couple of days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS - 24 Game Game Wallet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-24-game-game-wallet">DS - 24 Game Game Wallet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I also love getting packages that i completely forgot i ordered..  From the looks of the outside, it looks like a DVD or some PS2 game..  I noticed that the from address has a little ebay logo next to it.  I don't remember ordering anything off ebay in at least a month or two.  Oh what could it be..?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" /></p><p>Oh sweet.  It's that DS case i ordered when someone mentioned it in <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937" title="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937">this thread</a> on Cheap Ass Gamer.</p><p>I had been looking for a DS game case that could hold a large amount of DS carts for a while now.  When i first started buying DS games, i needed something to hold them in..  I mean, you can't carry around the game boxes because they're too bulky, and you can't carry the cartridge itself for fear of damage.  I first ran across <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do" title="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do"><br/>these cases</a> at Best Buy and they worked great when i owned 6 or 7 games, but when my game library grew, i needed more room.</p><p>I looked far and wide, but could not find anything as compact and portable as those 3 game shells.  I came across something similar on the internet, which held 6 games instead of 3, but i could not find anywhere to purchase such game case.  When i first got to Japan, it was easy to find <a href="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html" title="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html">this great case</a>.  This case is AS compact as the 3 game case and also comes in different colors and the game snaps into the case, rather than float around with the 3 game case.</p><p>This still hadn't solved my problem though.  My DS library had gotten up to the 20 range, and 3 little 3-game cases and a 6-er wasn't going to hold all my games.</p><p>When i saw this 24 game case on CAG, it only took a little googling to find <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">their website</a> and <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012">their product</a>.  Only 10 whole $.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" /></p><p>This case is pretty slick.  It's a stylish little case that's smalled than a DVD case with a tiny penguin in the corner, offered in two different accented colors.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" /></p><p>Inside are 4 pages which hold 6 games each.  Each page is slick plastic vinyl that couldn't possibly damage the game cart.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" /></p><p>It certainly looked like this Penguin case would solve my problem of tooo many little cases and consolidate the bulk of my little collection in one easy to carry around case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" /></p><p>The DS games slide in sideways, making the case viewable in a landscape view.  The pages are quite sleak and clean that the game slides right in without and resistance and damage to the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" /></p><p>5 minutes later, i stuffed most of my games into the case.  My collection has gone beyond 24 games, so there's not much you can do there.  My 6 game case can still hold the games i'm using most often, since it's quite portable.  Those crappy Kanji games can sit in that 3 game case for all i care.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" /></p><p>huzzah.  That huge mess of games has been consolidated down in one shiny penguin white and grey pack.  Just as easy to transport as my DS and my 6 pack.</p><p>I'd say that anyone with a decent amount of DS games, should definitely own one of these things.  It's rather appauling the most popular gaming system of 2006, and potentially of all-time, has dick for portable game storage to complement it's portable play.  It took independent game accessory maker, <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">Penguin United</a> to solve this annoying problem finally.</p><p>After looking through their site a little more, i think i'll probably order this <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011">Wii-mote Charger Stand</a> next, since one of my Wii-motes has ran out of batteries, and i don't plan on buying new batteries each time this happens.</p><p>Wheee<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/23">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/21">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
