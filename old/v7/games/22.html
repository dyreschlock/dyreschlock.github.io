| July 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I finally spent the chance to play more of Resident Evil 4 on the Wii, which came out about a month ago.  Some regard Resident Evil 4 as the best game of the last generation and I definitely agree that it's quite amazing.  With the Wii controls, better graphics than previous versions, and all the Extra bonus content, the Wii Edition proves itself as the definitive copy of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>About a month ago...</b></div><p>Man, I remember it like yesterday..  I had just moved into the new place, I made frequent posts on my blog..  That Tuesday, I stopped by Shopko looking for Resident Evil, but it was no where to be seen.  I got to my car and called a few places, all which indicated they would receive the game the next day.</p><p>After work the next day, I wasn't really in any rush.  I went out to Token Creek and played a round before stopped off at East Towne's Best Buy where I came into quite a shock.  "Hey my friend, do you guys get in Resident Evil 4 on the Wii?"  "We certainly did, consumer.  We had this entire rack over here filled up," the blue shirted employee explained as he gestured over to the now empty rack in the Wii section.  "guh!?  You guys are sold out?"  "undoubtedly"..</p><p>Crap..  I didn't take into account the popularity of this game.  It must've been advertised well.  "ummm...  well, does your West Towne store have any copies?"  A few brief moments of checking the computer revealed 3 copies remaining at the Best Buy near my house.  "Hot damn!  Thanks for the tip," as i rushed out of the store and into my car.</p><p>I guess this is what passes for adrenaline pumping, emotion driven task completion in my somewhat mundane boring life.</p><p>Thanks to the excruciating slow and dumb driving by the good people of Madison, WI, I did eventually reach the West Best Buy.  I frantically searched on the game shelves but found nothing until I checked one of the end-caps.  Huzzah..  It would seem that I have acquired the last copy at this location.  Ahhh.. that's a good feeling.</p><p>Anywho.. I spent the rest of the night playing it.  And also a good chunk of the weekend.  I beat the game once, and then proceeded through a second time earning money for the infinite rocket launcher.  I stopped at the point when I finally got it.</p><p>But as the week began, I got caught up in other things, and never really got back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Wii Gameplay</b></div><p>Resident Evil 4 is quite an amazing game and makes brilliant use of the Wii controls.  I find myself comparing this port against the other greatest game on the gamecube to receive a Wii port: Zelda - Twilight Princess.  I hated the Wii port of Twilight Princess.  The two things I absolutely hate about the Zelda Wii controls is un-precise sword controls and no camera control.  Both these are absolute non-issues for Resident Evil 4.</p><p>The Wii Controls add an amazing amount of attacking precise you use guns, rather than a sword.  Shooting a "Zombie" in the head could not be simpler.</p><p>The lack of camera is a non-issue because the game operate on a fixed camera to begin with, which lends itself perfectly for aiming and firing.</p><p>The gameplay was quite solid to begin with, but adding the extra precision of the Wii mote aiming brings it to a whole new level.  It's tough going back to FPSes on the 360 after playing Resident Evil 4.</p><div class='title'><b>Confession</b></div><p>This is the first time i've played Resident Evil 4, so it's not easy to draw the distinction between liking the game in the first place, or liking the game on the Wii.  So many people out there love Zelda on the Wii, but I think thats because they never got a chance to play the gamecube version.  When you fall in love with something, you grow loyalty towards that first initial experience and alike subsequent experiences won't measure up.</p><p>Some CAGers say they're in love with the Wii version of Resident Evil, despite playing through the Gamecube or Playstation 2 versions, but I'm not so sure I would be.  I have enough games I haven't played yet, to start playing a new version of something i had.</p><p>In that respect, I'm quite glad to have put off RE4 until now.  I'm also glad I played through Gamecube Twilight Princess before the Wii version.  Twilight Princess Wii is so gimmicky.</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>I do love this game quite a bit, and as mentioned earlier, I'm not the only one.  There are several things that bug me about the actual game design that would never have me saying, "greatest game ever"..  or even "greatest resident evil ever"</p><p>The gameplay, itself, is top notch.  Maybe that's why everyone is all about this game.  Resident Evil was in serious need of a gameplay revamp.  How stupid is a game where you can't even tell what exactly you're aiming at.  This problem reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 1.  For MGS2, they added in a first person view when firing your gun.  MGS1 did have some first person views, which is easily accomplished when all of your levels are 3D.  Resident Evil held onto the pre-rendered backgrounds a little too long, and in typical Capcom fashion pumped out a good 2 or 3 sequels before thinking about what they were doing.</p><p>That's all water under the bridge now, right?  Resident Evil 4 feels like a completely new game.  So much so, in fact, it doesn't even feel like a Resident Evil game.  They made an action game out of an adventure series.  They even split up the game into bite-sized level and sub-level chunks.  It's kinda like mario, you begin on stage 1-1.</p><p>Instead of finding yourself in an expansive area with some doors locked and other doors unlocked and you find keys to these doors, and solve puzzles to open others...  You find yourself on a linear path for point A to point B with very little exploration..  it's all about killing the zombies.</p><p>For a Resident Evil standpoint, it is disappointing.  You can't really take it at face value either with the number 4 in the title.  It's part of a series.  Being so, it should follow more than just the overall story, it should follow the feel as well.</p><p>Honestly, I still think the best Resident Evil is #2, with #1 as second.  Resident Evil 4 is amazing, but it's a Leon side-story.</p><div class='title'><b>Speaking of story...</b></div><p>Why are Resident Evil games getting more ridiculous?  Code Veronica made Claire into some kind of super hero, and the main boss was a cross-dressing psychopath.  In Resident Evil 4, Leon is also some kind of super hero was precise knife-handling skills and fast reflexes.  Does initial contact with Zombies make you that much better?  I suppose, you'd probably work out quite a bit for fear of the next impending Zombie disaster.</p><p>meh..</p><p>Part of what makes Resident Evil 1 and 2 so eerie is how down to earth you feel.  You feel like regular people trying to survive.  Regular people with guns, of course.</p><p>I hope Resident Evil 5 really brings back what it means to find yourself in a weird mysterious place in the heart of a Zombie outbreak.  An actual entire town would be fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>Segway</b></div><p>Now don't get me wrong..  if you haven't played Resident Evil 4, definitely pick it up.  It is one of best games of the last generation, and, currently, is the best game on the Wii.  You will not find a better, more affordable complement to your Wii library.</p><p>In fact, you probably won't find it because Stores have been sold out since that initial release.</p><p>Thanks to Resident Evil 4, I cannot wait for Metriod Prime ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Earth Defense Force" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-earth-defense-force">The Earth Defense Force</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Finally, the reason to own a 360 is here.  I picked this game up about a month and a half ago, and haven't really put it down since.</p><p>In EDF, the alien invasion has begun, and they've unleashed hordes of mutated gigantic ants, spiders and massive mechanical robots.  Luckily, a few years prior to the alien invasion earth setup a defense force just in case such things would occur.</p><p>You play a lowly pion in the army, and choose from over 150 unlockable weapons to completely eradicate every enemy in sight.  There's really no story, no plot twists or character plots to get in the way of blowing the shit out of robots, gigantic insects and UFOs.</p><p>It's fricken awesome.  "Oh my god.. Ants are crawling up the sides of Tokyo. Blow them the fuck up.  Oh shit, here comes more.  Damn!  Spiders.  Holy crap!  Robots shooting lazers up my ass..  reload reload goddammit..  blow it up..  die!"  Building are completely destructible as well, so firing a rocket into a horde of ants 5 stories up with demolish that business.</p><p>It's really nicely detailed too..   Most large buildings has convenience stores on them actually modeled after REAL convenience stores.  There's a Lawsons, Daily Yamazaki, and others!  Rad-tastic</p><p>____</p><p>Something I just noticed today, though, is that this is actually a remake of the PS2 game which came out back in 2003.  Simple Series Number 31.</p><p>Luckily, Japan never frowns on bad games being made..  they actually encourage it.  Simple Series is a publisher that pretty much publishes games on concept alone, regardless of the end product, and releases it at a budgeted price tag.  Concepts like "a maid versus the mafia", "a bikini clad warrior out to kill zombies", "collecting infected humans in an ambulance before they turn into zombies", or simply.. "defending the earth against gigantic ants and spiders"</p><p>The Simple Series can be found on PS2, PSP and DS..  maybe PS1 as well.  Though, some of these games actually sell pretty good and get sequels and ports to next-gen machines.  Such as the case with EDF.</p><p>Something else I learned today is that 2 years ago, Sandlot made Earth Defense Force 2 (Simple Series #81) and one year ago, they made Earth Defense Force Tactics (Simple Series #103)..  Both these two games come out in Europe today.</p><p>____</p><p>Anyways.. if you own a 360, you owe it to yourself to play Earth Defense Force.  It was released as a budgeted title at $40, but you could rent it just the same. ^_^</p><p>Here's hoping we'll be seeing Earth Defense Force 2 on the 360 in the future.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 Demos" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-demos">Xbox 360 Demos</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Friday, I spent a fair amount of time downloading a bunch of demos for the 360 that seemed pretty interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Project Silpheed</b></div><p>This is Squaresoft's first 360 game, so I had to give it a go.  Project Silpheed, not to be confused with the real Silpheed game series, and a 3D chase-view shmup set in space, kinda like Descent or Colony Wars.  You basically fly around and blow shit up.. just like any shmup.  The controls are so goddamn intricate, spending half an hour going through the tutorial is almost required.  In fact Penny Arcade did a <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/06/08" title="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/06/08">comic</a> on it.</p><p>On top of that, the game really isn't all that fun.  It's more of a chore to fly around and pick off all the enemy planes..  only to get killed in 3 direct hits by one lucky fellow.  Pass</p><div class='title'><b>Tenchu Z</b></div><p>Tenchu is probably one of my favorite games of all time.  In its core, it wasn't a particularly good game.  The gameplay on its own is nearly passable and was largely over shadowed by Metal Gear Solid at the time.  The AI of the enemies was dumb..  You could stand next to them and they detect you.  BUT the music was simply beautiful.  It has one of the must in-depth, powerful, and simply stunning soundtracks of any Playstation title.</p><p>There have been many sequels to Tenchu, but none have captured the essence of the original.  All have been shitty buggy clones with crappy music.  Why can't they just get the original composer's back and bring the franchise back to its glory days...?</p><p>Anyways, I saw the demo on Xbox Live and gave it a go.  Tenchu is a stealthy ninja game, where you kill your enemies without being detected.  You can grappled on top of buildings, jump down behind your enemy, and cut him open without him seeing you.</p><p>Tenchu Z actually surprised me a bit.  I felt like a was brought into the past and playing Tenchu for the first time again.  Everything seemed largely the same.  Scaling rooftops, dumbass easy-to-kill AI..  But it is missing two big things for me to fall completely in love: The music and the wicked.  The music in the demo is soft, subtle and boring, which means you never pay attention to it, which means it doesn't engross you into the environment.  Music will pull and guide you into any world the game or movie present.  I would put sound on par with anything sight can do..  So to completely fail at any auditory is a huge blow to the over all experience of the game.</p><p>The other thing the <b>demo</b> fails at is the overall wicked-ness of the original Tenchu.  Like with the skeleton baby cult, and lust for crazy fat people.  This is just a demo, so there's no way they'd get into any of the this stuff just yet..  Hopefully they will..  I'd be disappointed if there wasn't.</p><p>So...  if you've got a 360 and loved Tenchu back in the day, why not check it out.  It's certainly not as good as the original, but it's not too bad.  The demo said that the full game has 50+ missions in it, and plenty of customizable outfits, faces, and weapons.  It's been 9 years since the original came out..  relive the magic in its beaten up, broken down form.</p><p>I'll probably pick it up, if I could find it for $40.  $60 is way too much for this game..</p><p>Edit: Crap.. Tenchu Z just came out this week..  finding it for less than $60 will be difficult..  maybe i'll rent it.</p><div class='title'><b>DiRT</b></div><p>DiRT is a rally racing game which stole NiGHTS' and SiCKO's capitalization styles. The demo has a very arcade style of selecting cars and tracks.  Unlike the convoluted, over customization of Gran Turismo and Forza motorsports, You pick your car, pick your track, and away you go.  This is probably a little different in the actual game.</p><p>The graphics are simply beautiful.  Highly detailed cars, environments, etc..  What's really amazing in the damage you inflict on your car.  The slightest scratch or bump will change the appearance of your car and when you slam into a side-rail..?  Blam!  The front of the car is scrunched accordion style, while the hood is slightly torn up.  The side-rail has a huge dent in it next at the point of impact.</p><p>The damage is quite realistic, and sounds are so blunt and powerful..  It's hard to not have fun beating the shit out of your car.  Bushes, actually have mass too, and can scrape out your nice fine finish.  I've never seen a game take damage to the environment as seriously as taking damage to the car.</p><p>The thing I love about this game the most though, is the menu navigation.  I should really get some sort of screenshoting software to explain it.  It's a 2D menu in a 3D space..  kinda like the Wipeout Fusion menu, except when you select something, you fly around space to the next menu.  Each menu has a reflective text, so it shimmers in the light when you move across it.</p><p>Anyways, DiRT is a lot of fun despite being developed by codemasters, who special in making sub-par games.  It comes out this week for the 360, and in a couple of months for the PS3.  Definitely a rent title, but I would probably pick it up for $40 on the PS3 if there wasn't anything else going on at that time.</p><p>____</p><p>Huzzah.. fun times all around.  Definitely download these demos to see for yourself..  Especially the DiRT demo.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Big Brain Academy impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/big-brain-academy-impressions">Big Brain Academy impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week, <b>Big Brain Academy</b> joins the ranks of Cooking Mama and Trauma Center as another DS title remade and ported to your television.  And much like Cooking Mama and Trauma Center, it is identical to the DS title with minor tweaks, changes and multi-player modes added.</p><p>Today I finally broke down and picked it up.  Knowing that $50 is way too damn much for this game..  Knowing there are only 15 mini-games in this whole package..  After checking blockbuster each day hoping they'd have it..  After keeping myself away from Best Buy, Shopko, and all those other places where I'd be tempted to purchase it..  Even after telling myself over and over again that I can just wait a week and Resident Evil 4 will be out on the Wii..  After all that..  I caught a thread on Cheap Ass Gamer, stating it was $40 this week at Circuit City.  and.. I came across an article which said I could get a free Wii-mote keychain.  So whatever..  I picked it up.</p><p>Bad Choice.</p><p>Big Brain Academy boasts its depth in bulking up and building your brain, but offers the most shallow presentation, gameplay, and overall quality on the Wii alongside Wii Play.</p><p>For single player modes you have training and practice.  With training, you delve through 5 areas of focus with 10 puzzles each.  For each area a weight is calculated to determine how massive your brain is.  These are totaled up and kept track of.  Sounds like fun eh?  As some of my old roommates said, "wow..  it's like they made a game based off of school that's actually as boring as school."</p><p>You also have practice mode where you can go through each area one by one, on any difficulty and get bronze, silver, gold or platinum medals for your successes.</p><p>Multiplayer has 3 different modes that use all these same games.</p><p>And... that's it.  I'm already fricken bored of it.  It does have a little connectivity online, but that's only to compare your brain's weight to others in your Wii address book.</p><p>Much like the DS titles, it seems like this is the type of game you play for 15 to 30 minutes a day and improve your brain's capacity.  That works great for the DS because it's a portable system.  It's designed for pick-up, play and put-away type games like this.  The Wii is a home console..  people don't spend full price on a snack size game when they expect a full meal.</p><p>Honestly, so far the Wii library has done a horrible job at making an actual compelling game to sink time into..  Luckily they ported Twilight Princess, so you can throw that argument back in my face.</p><p>Anyways, why didn't they just forget about the multiplayer, beef up the online connectivity, and release this as a $20 downloadable channel in Shop Channel?  It seems like such a waste to have this tiny game on an entire disc..  If I'm only going to spend 10 or 15 minutes playing it, I don't want to have to switch discs every single time.  I want it easily accessible like the 'Everyone Votes' channel.  Would you spend $50 for that?</p><p>If you really want to play this game, I suggest you rent it..  If you really want to buy it, though..  wait until it's $20.. or hell..  you could just buy it off me.  I already registered it for the Wii-mote key chain though.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to This just in: PSP Slim Data" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/this-just-in-psp-slim-data">This just in: PSP Slim Data</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Graphics</b></div><p>New York is the center stage for the end of humanity.  Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast-2">End Gen Dreamcast (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Karous</b></div><p>Karous was released in February 2007. I found this game on my latest trek back to Japan in my local new/used gaming store. They actually had a couple copies of the game, and one copy used for $45. I did think it over long and hard whether i should buy this game.. It is developed and self-published by Milestone, who also made Radilgy and Chaos Field. Chaos Field was actually a rather fun game, and Radilgy looked pretty crazy.. so, by association, i laid down my 4500 yen.</p><p>Karous is a very minimalist styled shooter through and through.  The graphics are cell-shaded and drenched in deep dark blues, greens and greys, but complemented with other over-used bright white.  It probably looked like a good idea on paper, but in execution looks very unfinished.  When you use cell-shading, you must be very aware of shapes and forms and how shadows well bring out the simplistic complexity of your subject.  I think cell-shading is a horrible medium for shooters because you have no time to soak in the subtleties and models are going to be too tiny to see any detail.</p><p>Unfortunately they carry this throughout each level like a dead horse.  I don't know if they re-use the same environments, but each stage looks exactly the same..  I really can't tell the difference.  All the enemies have the same grayscaled colors, so the bosses really can't be distinguished from each other easily.</p><p>The game does not scale very well either.  I can hardly see what the hell is going on with the game on my TV.  In Yoko mode, you can't even see what level your weapons are at.  Tate mode really isn't all that much better either.  Aliasing abound!</p><p>Anyways, the minimalistic theme continues into the music.  The soundtrack features plenty of broken drumming, chimes, and lack of melody that produces very experimental sounds.  It's a very different approach to a shooter OST and i'm not really sure that it works out for them.  You have no sense of suspense or thrill when playing levels..  It really ends up bothering me more than pulling me in.</p><p>The gameplay works very similar to Chaos Field.  You have 3 buttons..  One for shoot, one for bombs, and one for sword.  Also, when you stop shooting you have a shield which is automatically deployed.  Each of these attacks have a separate color.  (Green for sword, Blue for shot, Red for bomb, and Yellow for Shield.)  When you hit an enemies, they'll shimmer in the color of which weapon they are weakest against.  Most shimmer in Red, but you'll get the occasional green or yellow.</p><p>Each of your weapons can be powered up through use or grabbing power-ups.  These power-ups usually come from drones of like enemies, or big ass enemies.  You'll usually get a little blue triangle which you can smack a couple times with your sword to power-up.  Also, i think just general firing and killing powers up your bomb.</p><p>Overall, this game is challenging, but i'd only recommend it as a last resort.  The graphics are actually pretty bad, and the music doesn't complement the gameplay well.  It's actually kind of annoying to play..  I guess i now know the reason why Tom Sawyer had so many copies of the game..  Oh well...  the gameplay does have some redeeming qualities.</p><div class='title'><b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b></div><p>Exelica is the most recent Dreamcast game which came up March 2007. Purple Godzilla in Seattle, WA showcased this game at Sakura-Con and had it for a very fair price of $65, considering it was nearly identical to the Japanese price of 6500 yen. I had seen Exelica in Japanese arcades before, and #five actually played a bit too. The gameplay looked very different than your normal shmup, so i figured, hell, i'd give it a shot.</p><p>In Trigger Heart Exelica, you play Exelica or Crueltear, two anime girls out to save or defeat their friend or foe.  You wage war against an onslaught of futuristic space ships in your flying power armor.  The game reminds me a lot of Shikigami no Shiro for some reason, even though the two games are completely different.  Massive points are obtained through collecting gold pieces from destroyed enemies and fire.</p><p>You have 3 attacks: normal fire, bombs and grapple.  Exelica and Crueltear have different shoot waves..  Exelica is rather spread out, while Crueltear's is straight on.  Bombs are as standard as ever.</p><p>The grapple technique is what makes this game so unique.  You can grapple nearly any enemy on the screen.  Bigger enemies will take a little longer..  Once you've captured them, they will shield you from oncoming bullets, and you can also smash them into enemies for massive points and damage.  When you move back and forth while holding an enemy, you'll swing back and forth..  swinging the enemy all the way around you will put you into a spin that'll almost shield you completely against enemy fire.  When you let go, the enemy goes flying and it's explosion destroys everything in the immediate area.</p><p>This makes some impossible to dodge areas essential for using the grapple technique.  There's one particular part in Stage 3 where the entire screen is jam packed with enemies..  you can't even get around them.  Not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of bullets..  Grappling one enemy and tossing him in the center of all that mess will clean out a lot of your obstacles.</p><p>The graphics are pretty decent.  They aren't crazy mind blowing graphics, but they are certainly don't suck.  The music also compliments the game quite well.  Unfortunately the sounds could use a lot more bass.  Blowing up things is MUCH more satisfying with a sound that you can feel in your body.</p><p>Overall, this game is pretty fun, albeit spinning around while grappling an enemy can be difficult to get the hang of.  A little nick picky thing that i don't really like is that you start off with infinite credits, rather than eventually unlocking more over time.  Starting off with only a set amount of credits will inspire you to get better at the game, and eventually push yourself to greatness.  Having the whole game laid out to you on your first sitting is very unrewarding.</p><p>$65 is a very steep price for this game though.  That money would be better spent on Under Defeat.  If you came across this game in an arcade, i'd definitely recommend a few coins of play to see if you like it.</p><div class='title'><b>The tears of the ages...</b></div><p>Unfortunately, this is the end of the Dreamcast.  As of February this year, Sega has officially stopped all production of the GD-Rom medium, and 2 week ago, declared that on September 28th, 2007, Dreamcast Repair Services will cease completely.  The Dreamcast lasted nearly 9 years in the marketplace...  not too many consoles can say that.  Of course, those companies have bigger better projects to focus on.</p><p>This doesn't spell demise for the Naomi boards..  In fact, Triangle Service is currently developing their latest shmup, Exzeal, for the Naomi cabinets and set to be released this year.  Triangle Service had previous released Trizeal in 2005 for the Dreamcast.  This doesn't guarantee a Dreamcast release though..  Trizeal has been ported over to Ps2 for a wider audience.</p><p>G.rev's most recent game, Senko no Ronde, was also Naomi GD-Rom, but was remade and updated for home release on the Xbox 360, which is coming to the US next month thanks to Ubi Soft.  Senko no Ronde is shmup fighter hybrid type game.</p><div class='title'><b>Since Naomi<br/></b></div><p>Though Naomi development still goes on with 3rd party Arcade developers, Sega has moved on.  Not that long after Naomi originally debuted, Sega released the Naomi 2 in 2000.  Naomi 2 was a beefed up Naomi board with more better everything.  Though, with the pending death of the Dreamcast, Sega began focusing on other hardware.</p><p>Namco had already taken a cue from Sega, and had partnered with Sony to release Playstation-like hardware in the Arcades..  With console sales heading the gaming industry, Sega looked to the other consoles for Arcade hardware.</p><p>In 2002, Sega released the Chihiro hardware based on the Xbox.  Sega made a few changes though by scrapping the DVD-Rom drive for a GD-Rom drive, and make the RAM expandable for upgrades.  They also made full use of the communication capabilities of the Xbox and developed a slew of networkable titles.  These games you could play against anyone else in an Arcade across Japan.</p><p>Sega continued with their idea of making porting games easy from Arcade to Xbox and Xbox to Arcade.. Unfortunately, the Memory upgrades were used heavily in the Arcade which made scaling games to the home unit difficult.  Wikipedia points out that Outrun 2 used 512mb memory in the arcade, while the Xbox had only 64mb to work with.</p><p>Also in 2002, Sega has teamed up with Namco and Nintendo to release the Triforce Arcade hardware.  Partnership and development centered around the Nintendo Gamecube hardware and the release of F-Zero AX/GX, one of my favorite games of all time.  This was also a good opportunity for Nintendo to get some market share in the Arcades again..  Aside from F-Zero, Mario Kart GP is the other notable release for this hardware.  Mario Kart 2 was released early this year.</p><p>I guess the Sega, Namco, Nintendo Triforce partership was the middle ground for all big-name console and arcade hardware developers..  Sega w/ Microsoft, Namco w/ Sony, and Sega/Namco in the middle with Nintendo.</p><div class='title'><b>Turning to the future, PC in 2004</b></div><p>In 2004, Sega released their current Arcade hardware, the Lindbergh.  It was originally going to be based on the Xbox 360, but eventually became PC based instead.  In fact, also in 2004, Taito released their current arcade hardware which is also PC based..  PC based machines offered far more extensibility for upgrades and stacking processors..</p><p>That's kind of the same direction the shmup community has been going as well.  Independently developed PC shmups have really caught the eyes of many circles.  Especially the Toho Project, responsible for Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night.  I haven't played any of these though, unfortunately.</p><p>Anywho.. i guess we'll see where Shmups will find their home in this new generation.  Senko no Ronde is on the 360, Gradius VI is coming out on PS3..  all while the Wii might be the best home with low publishing costs and a very retro community fanbase.  Most shmups these past years have found themselves on the PS2 because of how popular it is, rather than how identical the hardware is to its' original.  I'm sure that'll be the same in the coming years.</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming American Shmup Releases</b></div><p>April 17th.  Raiden III on Playstation 2 for $30<br/>April 27th.  Radilgy (Radio Allergy) on Gamecube for $30<br/>May 22nd.  Senko no Ronde (WarTech) on Xbox 360 for $60 ...  ugh :/<br/>Soon.  Ikaruga on Xbox Live Marketplace.</p><p>... and probably some other ones too.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/23">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/21">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
