| April 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On January 31st, 2001, Sega announced that they would discontinue the Dreamcast and would focus on 3rd Party support for other home consoles instead.  The Dreamcast had a very short life which began in November 1998 in Japan, and September 9th, 1999 in America.  In February 2002, NHL 2k2 was the last game released in America..  However, life continues to grow in small reaches thanks its initial purpose and devoted fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallel Arcade Development</b></div><p>The Sega Saturn was really the first instance of Sega developing their home console along-side arcade Hardware.  In 1994, Sega released the Saturn in Japan, alongside their ST-V arcade hardware.  Since the hardware was nearly identical, games arcade games developed for ST-V could be ported near exactly.  Fans could play exact copies of arcade games on their home console.  The other difference was that ST-V arcade units took huge clunky cartridges, while the Saturn took standard CDs.</p><p>The Saturn was initially flawed due to its emphasis on 2D graphics, and last minute 3D graphical additions.  2D games looked amazing, but the populous was captivated by the 3D marvels other consoles and arcade hardware provided.  Sega lost support, but they learned from their mistakes... sort of.</p><p>Sega began development of the Naomi arcade boards, to be far more versatile.  The <b>N</b>ew <b>A</b>rcade <b>O</b>peration <b>M</b>achine <b>I</b>dea was developed with both 2D and 3D in mind.  Boards were set up to process in parallel, so you could just add another board and increase processing power.  (and) Machines were fitted to read from GD-Roms, Sega's proprietary disc format.  GD-Roms were just normal CD-Roms except data was compacted together for optimal storage capacity.  A normal 700mb disc, could hold up to 1.2gb of data.</p><p>This was extremely flexible for the developers..  The could now produce discs to distribute their games, rather than cartridges..  something the console industry had already been doing at this time.</p><p>The Dreamcast is a lone Naomi board, squished into a plastic case, ready for sale to the mass public.  In 1998, Sega released both the Naomi boards and the Dreamcast in Japan.  (and then) The Dreamcast pretty much died in 2002.  Few games released, first party support dropped, and a very healthy alternative: Playstation 2.  However, it was their Naomi boards that continue to spur life on thanks to a healthy underground game genre.</p><div class='title'><b>Shmups</b></div><p>Shmups is an audible abbreviation for Shoot 'em ups, or Shooters.  Such famous shmups include 1941, Defender, Gallaga, Asteroids, Gradius..  Games that involve some sort of airplane or space ship, dodging enemy fire and other obstacles, while shooting up enemies.  Shmups were somewhat mainstream when gameplay and graphics were simply, but began to go underground when mainstream games began to offer more.</p><p>Anyways..  Shmup companies turned to the Naomi boards for their cheap development and production costs, as well as, ease of porting to a home console.  Shmup companies continued to develop Naomi games and subsequently release them on the Dreamcast even after the consoles death.  Since 2003, the Dreamcast has had 9 shmup releases: Shikigami no Shiro 2, Psyvariar 2, Border Down, Chaos Field, Trizeal, Radilgy, Under Defeat, Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica..  as well as some hentai releases.</p><p>These Dreamcast games would not have been possible if not for the Naomi boards and the devoted fans of the Shmup community.  In fact, such after death support began to reach enough demand for Sega to re-release some Dreamcast units in 2006, packaged with Radilgy.</p><p>Most of these after-death titles have been ported to other consoles, and thanks to O3 (Sega's unofficial private US publishing company) some have even come to the states.  Chaos Field was released in America in Feb 2005 on the Gamecube..  Currently, O3 is bringing over Radilgy on Gamecube posed to release at the end of April.  They renamed in Radio Allergy, though</p><div class='title'><b>The Dreamcast lives on..  kinda<br/></b></div><p>Man..  my Dreamcast has seen better days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" /></p><p>One day when I tried playing Crazy Taxi, the disc would scrape along the tray cover.  I took it upon myself to fix this problem..  so I took off the case, tightened some screws, and reassembled it.  Well...  the CD had plenty of room to spin around, but the Dreamcast always thought the tray was open.  When I reassembled it, the tray no longer hit the little lever in the back :/  Nothing a little tape won't fit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" /></p><p>To play import games on my Dreamcast, i need a boot disc.  Something that took about 5 minutes of googling, and another 5 minutes of burning to accomplish.  When completely screwed together, my Dreamcast thinks the tray is either closed or open..  It can't detect open/close functionality..  So i help it along..  no biggie.  Thus my Dreamcast looks like Dreamcastenstien.  It has life..!  I have given it life..!</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>Throughout my travels across the earth, across the country, and across the internet, I've found myself in the position of purchasing the 3 most recent Dreamcast games:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" /></p><p>Under Defeat, Karous, and Trigger Heart Exelica, in order of release date..  After the Dreamcast Rerelease in 2006, They began publishing games with DVD style cases rather than CD cases.</p><p>So...  Are these games actually worth it?  well... here's what i think:</p><div class='title'><b>Under Defeat (Limited)</b></div><p>Originally released in early 2006, I found this game from <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/" title="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</a>.  I wasn't really sure if i was seeing it correctly, but they actually had copies of the Limited Edition version which came with the soundtrack.  I had heard Under Defeat was an amazing game, so i decided to order it.  Also, i think someone said the Limited version was super crazy rare, so that was also a deciding factor.</p><p>Under Defeat is developed by G.rev, which was founded by several Taito employees who had developed G Darius.  G.rev's notable works include Border Down, also on Dreamcast after its death.  G.rev is also noted for working with Treasure on their development of Ikaruga and Gradius V, two of the best shooters ever made.</p><p>Under Defeat does not disappoint.  You pilot a German attack helicopter in a modern version of World War II.  The helicopter will rotate right and left when you move allowing you to fire at an angle rather than straight on the whole time.  You get 3 bombs to start off with that launch an air strike upon the ground..</p><p>The little bit of innovation comes into, what they call, an option.  When you hold your fire long enough, a little green bar will fill up in the lower left hand corner.  When it flashes OK, you can begin firing again, and you'll release a little pod which will fire upon your opponents.  You can grab other power-ups that will change its weapon: Vulcan, Cannon and Rocket (from weakest and frequent to strongest and less frequent).</p><p>All kills this little guy acquires will net you double points.. and Therein lies the secret to obtaining massive points: Have the option kill as many high point gainers as possible..  especially laying the final blow on bosses.</p><p>The gameplay is very easy to pick up since it is rather basic..  The sounds and graphics add that extra icing on the cake that makes this game great fun.  The game plays 2D, but the graphics are in full 3D featuring rich textures and distinguishable colors and models to make enemies noticable and prominent.  Bullets are pretty easy to spot too.</p><p>Stylistically, smoke and explosions plays a extra role..  Whenever you fire a bullet a little bit of smoke emits from your cannon.  The Bullet flies through the air and hit your target with a little bit of smoke residue.  When enemies die, there's a little bit of pause as its engulfed in flames and bursts from explosion.  The fiery orange sparks from the enemy but is sharply over powered by black smoke.  The smoke stays in the air, and eventually fades away from the sky..   Sometimes, if you aren't heavily shooting up an enemy it'll blow up a little and fall to the earth underneath emitting a smoke trailed descent.  Another explosion results in the impact, with more smoke.</p><p>Under Defeat is an amazing joy to play, albeit just a little bit difficult.  I would definitely recommend any casual fan of the shooter genre to check out this game.  Much like Border Down, it will most likely stay on the Dreamcast, so if you do find a copy online for around $50, that will probably be the cheapest you'll get it for.</p><p>Buy from import retailers who support these companies by buying their products in the first place.  With out community support, we wouldn't even have these games at all.  In fact, Ncsx still has copies of the LE version in stock: http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/T-46704M.html  .. if you're a fan and you have the money, i'd say it's worth it.  Then you can say, "Yes..  i am responsible for the Dreamcast refusing to die."</p><div class='title'><b>More to come...</b></div><p>I'll get my impression of the Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica up in the next couple of days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS - 24 Game Game Wallet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-24-game-game-wallet">DS - 24 Game Game Wallet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I also love getting packages that i completely forgot i ordered..  From the looks of the outside, it looks like a DVD or some PS2 game..  I noticed that the from address has a little ebay logo next to it.  I don't remember ordering anything off ebay in at least a month or two.  Oh what could it be..?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07893.webp" /></p><p>Oh sweet.  It's that DS case i ordered when someone mentioned it in <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937" title="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937">this thread</a> on Cheap Ass Gamer.</p><p>I had been looking for a DS game case that could hold a large amount of DS carts for a while now.  When i first started buying DS games, i needed something to hold them in..  I mean, you can't carry around the game boxes because they're too bulky, and you can't carry the cartridge itself for fear of damage.  I first ran across <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do" title="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do"><br/>these cases</a> at Best Buy and they worked great when i owned 6 or 7 games, but when my game library grew, i needed more room.</p><p>I looked far and wide, but could not find anything as compact and portable as those 3 game shells.  I came across something similar on the internet, which held 6 games instead of 3, but i could not find anywhere to purchase such game case.  When i first got to Japan, it was easy to find <a href="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html" title="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html">this great case</a>.  This case is AS compact as the 3 game case and also comes in different colors and the game snaps into the case, rather than float around with the 3 game case.</p><p>This still hadn't solved my problem though.  My DS library had gotten up to the 20 range, and 3 little 3-game cases and a 6-er wasn't going to hold all my games.</p><p>When i saw this 24 game case on CAG, it only took a little googling to find <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">their website</a> and <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012">their product</a>.  Only 10 whole $.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" /></p><p>This case is pretty slick.  It's a stylish little case that's smalled than a DVD case with a tiny penguin in the corner, offered in two different accented colors.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07895.webp" /></p><p>Inside are 4 pages which hold 6 games each.  Each page is slick plastic vinyl that couldn't possibly damage the game cart.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" /></p><p>It certainly looked like this Penguin case would solve my problem of tooo many little cases and consolidate the bulk of my little collection in one easy to carry around case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" /></p><p>The DS games slide in sideways, making the case viewable in a landscape view.  The pages are quite sleak and clean that the game slides right in without and resistance and damage to the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" /></p><p>5 minutes later, i stuffed most of my games into the case.  My collection has gone beyond 24 games, so there's not much you can do there.  My 6 game case can still hold the games i'm using most often, since it's quite portable.  Those crappy Kanji games can sit in that 3 game case for all i care.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" /></p><p>huzzah.  That huge mess of games has been consolidated down in one shiny penguin white and grey pack.  Just as easy to transport as my DS and my 6 pack.</p><p>I'd say that anyone with a decent amount of DS games, should definitely own one of these things.  It's rather appauling the most popular gaming system of 2006, and potentially of all-time, has dick for portable game storage to complement it's portable play.  It took independent game accessory maker, <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">Penguin United</a> to solve this annoying problem finally.</p><p>After looking through their site a little more, i think i'll probably order this <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011">Wii-mote Charger Stand</a> next, since one of my Wii-motes has ran out of batteries, and i don't plan on buying new batteries each time this happens.</p><p>Wheee<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS - Contact" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-contact">DS - Contact</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Contact was released by Atlus in the states around the middle of september last year.  Sadly, I missed this release by a couple days when my plane left for planet japan.  I picked it up about a week before my next trip to japan, so I would have plenty of time to devote to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Contact follows the mis-adventure of the professor.  The professor ship had been shot by another spaceship knocking his energy crystals to the earth.  As he crashes to earth his path is crossed with our main character, Terry.  The professor plucks Terry from his daily life and pulls him into the conflict.  Now Terry will help reclaim these crystals as you guide him!</p><div class='title'><b>Art Style</b></div><p>What initially drew me to Contact was the art style.  The world of contact uses vibrant colors in fairly realistically concepted environments.  As a contrast, the world of the professor is a 16 bit throw back.  In essence Terry lives in the graphical age of today's sprite world; whereas, is stuck back on super nintendo.  When playing Contact, the professor's 16 bit world is always on top commenting on Terry's action while you guide Terry in the real world below.</p><div class='title'><b>Oh Comedy</b></div><p>The professor may seem stuck in the past, but he's pretty up on the internet.  The game manual is page after page of his live journal entries.  The real comedy gold are the references in his comments, though they do become quite short and repetitive.  Occasionally when you kill something easy, he'll say 'weaksauce.'  When you traverse the military compound, he'll make an 'all your base' reference.</p><p>The comedy is undoubtedly Contact's greatest appeal.  The story itself hasn't gone anywhere in the 5 hours i've played.  It seems to just fuel the game and push it along.  I mean, all you do is go around finding these crystals.  Then again, I had spent some time just leveling and killing townspeople.</p><div class='title'><b>Leveling</b></div><p>Anywho, Contact follows a very MMO style leveling system, as each individual skill is leveled and trained, rather than a set amount of experience.  You have all the normal rpg skills such as strength, stamina, wisdom, and defense, but weapon and magic skills are individual.  You have separate levels for swords, hand-to-hand, and blunt objects; likewise, earth, water, wind and fire elements are separate.  Leveling is pretty easy though..  You just need to use 'em.</p><p>There are other skills to level such as cooking and lock picking.  These skills are specific to the clothes that you wear, which replaces traditional style armor.  Each set of clothes have separate attributes, such as increased evade, increased strength.. But also associated abilities, like cooking and lock picking.  Clothes aren't usually found in chests or markets, though.  They generally require some sort of unlocked event or difficult optional battle.</p><p>Weapons and Clothes aren't the only stat increases.  Replacing a traditional accessory system, Contact has decals.  There are some key 'itemed' key decals, which are different, but you may equip 4 regular decals on Terry.  In the field you'll come across these decals as a '? Decal'.  In your menu, you use the stylus to peal off the decal to reveal it's true identity.  The usual ones i've run across have been stuff like Battle decal or Defense decal.  The stats they boost are drawn at random, so you can really buff up your character.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As for actual gameplay, Contact, once again, acts like an MMO.  You freely walk around, as do mobs.  Some mobs will attack you, while others will leave you alone or even run away.  Terry has a peace mode and a war mode.  While in war mode, you can point at which monsters Terry should vanquish.  You can also kill any npc you want, friend or foe.  One time I walked into a town.  The first guy said, 'hi. Welcome to our town.'  then I laid him to rest with my blade.</p><p>This is another whole aspect of Contact.  Terry can have a good alignment or an evil alignment depending on your decisions, much like Fable.  Killing baddies nets you brownie points, while the opposite does the opposite.  Luckily the game forgives one infraction each time.  It won't deduct negative alignment if your last kill was positive..  You have to do it twice in a row for that to happen.  Same with the other way..  It kinda works like tennis scoring.</p><p>Anyways, Terry also can come across spells and techniques to make life easier.  These use up EP (or whatever it's called) which is collected as you kill things.  Terry starts off with 5 max EP.  Most moves use up 1 or 2.</p><p>Running around killing monsters is pretty boring though.  You walk up to something, go into war mode, and let Terry attack away.  You can pull up the menu at any time and heal him though.  HOWEVER, this introduces another aspect.  You have a ba-zillion different things you can feed Terry to heal him, but some things will take longer to digest.  You can't feed a full stomach, so don't feed terry a bunch of 30HP hamburgers that'll take 5 minutes to get rid of.</p><p>Anywho, killing mobs may be monotanous, but at least boss battles feature some interactivity.  The first boss is some rock monster that throw punches and boulders at you..  Both of which are pretty easy to dodge.  Unlike regular enemies and if you time it right, you can defeat a boss without taking a hit.  Huzzah..</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>Despite it's comedic appeal and depth of gameplay, it does get rather tedious.  Having 20 different adds a bit of depth to the game, but you have to spend some time leveling up all the stats.  It probably wouldn't be so bad, if the gameplay offered more than just going into killing mode to fight.  Some more action style moves would've broken this up..  9aybe they thought they added too much complexity already..  I haven't even touched the cooking part of the game.</p><p>At the moment I cannot definitely recommend this game one way or the other.  I'd need to spend more time to see where the story actually goes..  Though given, the current situations, you probably eventually fight the opposing forces and save the day and the comedy probably won't go any further than the comments the professor makes.</p><p>It's kind of a little gaming gem, but overall, you won't miss it.  Oh well....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Game Library" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-library">Game Library</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I thought it was pretty neat.  You can see what people are actually buying, rather than look at sales numbers or just what people are complaining about, or simply what they are playing.</p><p>Concurrently to this, personally, i've been keeping track of all the games i own for well over a year.  I think i inventoried all my games around the Summer of 2004, or sometime in that Fall season.  Actually, maybe it was that christmas break.  Some people at SPAMM had their own game lists, and i knew my game library kicked the ass out of their game library.  So i cataloged.</p><p>Here's the old one: <a href="/pages/games/games2.html" title="/pages/games/games2.html">http://www.theschlock.com/misc/games2.html</a>.  It worked out pretty well.  All the code is stuffed into one html file, which makes updating and upkeep rather easy.</p><p>Of course, no one really gave a shit..  None the less, i kept it updated and linked it from Cheap Ass Gamer like a bunch of other gaming nerds do.</p><p>In recently months, i had actually been doing something similar to what the NeoGAFers had been doing, but only in comment form..  If you view the source of that page, you'll notice after the more recently entries they have a '//added mm/dd/yyyy' after them.</p><p>I hadn't extended this idea to code or design, but that's what i did yesterday.  I think the NeoGAFers were onto something, so i took it and ran with it.</p><p>Here's the new games list: <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/games2.html</a>.</p><p>The games2.html page is pretty much the same.  The only thing i did was pull out most of the javascript and css into their own files for the other page to share..  <a href="/pages/games/lst/sales.html" title="/pages/games/lst/sales.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/sales.html</a> is the new file that extends my games list with all my recent purchases.  I also took the idea a little further by adding where i bought the game, and how much it cost.</p><p>Even though, i could probably go back a couple months and fill in information, i think i'm just going to pitch March 2007 as my starting point.  That way it'll be 100% correct, rather than missing a few pieces.</p><p>In the future, it might be fun to start adding in statistic gathering and create Trend graphs and the like.  Before that, i should probably update this with server-side scripting so it loads as fast as possible.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Trauma Center Wii" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/trauma-center-wii">Trauma Center Wii</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As indicated by the previous articles, a couple of weeks ago i purchased a Wii.  A thread on Cheap Ass Gamer stated that Wal*mart was holding on their shipment of Wii to be released on that coming Sunday.  So, that sunday, i woke up at stupid o'clock in the morning, put on my jacket and drove over to Wal*mart.  It was only 5 minutes away from my house anyways.</p><p>I got their 15 minutes before they opened, and received the number 17 to indicate my place in line.  Apparently, this was more well known than i thought.  They had plenty of Wii machines to go around, though.  I got home and went back to bed for a little while.  Later on that day, we hooked it up and started messing around with Wii Sports, but got bored of it.  I wanted something fun to play that took advantage of the Wii-mote's capabilities.</p><p>I went out and picked up Trauma Center as my first Wii title.  I thought this was rather nostalgic since Trauma Center was also the first title i purchased for my DS.  I got home, put it in, and started to play.</p><p>For some reason, i thought this was a brand new game.  Since the full title of the game is "Trauma Center: Second Opinion", i thought that meant this was Trauma Center 2.  They couldn't really make a sequel of Trauma Center DS, but they could've had more doctors in other parts of the Trauma Center universe.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trauma Center Wii is a port of the DS title.  The story, characters and surgeries are the same fun missions you tackled on the portable venue.  How disappointing..</p><p>They did add another character at the last minute.  When you complete a story arc, you unlock another story with another character.  These missions take full advantage of the Wii controller.  In the first mission, you twist the Wii-mote to place a shattered broken bone back together.</p><p>On its' own, Trauma Center really starves the player.  The gameplay really lends itself to an Arcade setting, but the bulk of time spent in game is reading character dialogue.  The player sits through boring text until they finally get to experience the action and fast-paced setting of the surgery gameplay.  As far as i know, you can't skip this dialogue..  i should look into that.  Unfortunately, if they removed all story and just had a bunch of surgeries, the game wouldn't have any depth.</p><p>The gameplay is where Trauma Center really shines.  You have several different tools that you switch back and forth through while performing the surgery as outlined in the dialogue.</p><p>I'm not really sure which version of Trauma Center i prefer.  In the DS version, you have the extra precision of pinpoint pen strokes on the touch screen, but with the Wii version you have the speed and agility of an extra controller to switch between instruments.</p><p>There are other little differences as well.  On the Wii version, you actually use the defibrillators rather than the nurse automatically doing it for you.  Using the healing touch i've found to be much more difficult, but i think i just need to get used to the timing.</p><p>Anywho, i do love Trauma Center, but there are many downfalls that make it difficult to recommend to people.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-3">Twilight Princess (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, i finally came across Twilight Princess on the Wii for a cheapy price tag, so i picked it up.  Thinking back, i'm not really sure why.  In the past two months i've started 6 games that i have not finished.  These games would be Portrait of Ruin on DS, Final Fantasy XII on PS2, Cooking Mama on DS, Hotel Dusk on DS, Trauma Center on Wii, and Picross DS on DS.  I've been playing Picross quite a bit, but the other games are becoming lost causes..  Starting ANOTHER game would be foolish right?</p><p>Whatever..  i want a fun Wii game that i can sink time into.  I like the Wii quite a bit, but i'm stuck in Trauma Center, and Wii Sports and Wii Play don't really hold my interest.  The only other game i play quite a bit on my Wii is Gunstar Heroes, but i'm getting my assed kicked on Level 5.</p><p>Anyways..  i bought Wii Twilight Princess and started playing it yesterday.  There's a pretty stunning difference between the gamecube version and the wii version of the game, which everyone already knows about.  Traditionally Link is a left-handed sword wielder, but the vast majority of earth's population are right-handed sword wielders.  Rather than re-code Link's physics or model, they decided to mirror the entire game.  In other words, Right is Left and Left is Right.  Now link is right-handed... i guess.</p><p>I didn't think this would really bother me at all, but i find myself getting lost every now and then when i'm trying to find a house or navigate throughout the world.  Dungeons are pretty easy though, since i hadn't spent nearly the amount of time i have in villages or the world overall.</p><p>The obvious difference is most certainly the controls.  I'm not a big fan of the Wii controls.  Aiming with the slingshot, boomerang, etc is FAR better with the Wii-mote, but sword play is way too flexible.  On Gamecube Twilight Princess, you just hit the B button to slash and beat up things, but on the Wii you swing the Wii-mote back and forth motion which loses a lot of precision.  It's far worse than using an analog PS2 controller for a fighter..  The jousting event took me about half an hour to finally figure out when the sword actually swings when i jerk the Wii-mote to the side.  With the Gamecube controller, you hit the button and Link swings the sword right then.  Precision is key when you come to events based on timing and the Wii-mote doesn't offer that type of precision.  I eventually figured it out, though ^_^</p><p>The other thing that annoys me is the lack of camera views in the Wii version.  On the Gamecube controller the C-button left and right would move the camera left and right.  The C-button up and down would pull and push the camera away from and towards Link.  Unless i'm missing it, there is no camera movement in the Wii version at all.  I've been using the Z button to correct the camera's placement.</p><p>They should've used the D-pad for the view changing, but ended up using that to store weapons.  In this way, Link can have 4 total weapons out at once rather than 3 in the Gamecube version.  The Wii controller is a little disadvantage for button mapping though.  Both controllers have 8 buttons, an analog stick and a D-pad, but the Wii controller lacks that C-button stick on the Gamecube controller.  So, rather than code around this problem, it seems that they just omitted camera controls from the game.</p><p>Unless i'm missing something..  I'm probably missing something..  maybe you can do Camera control with the B button on the Wii.  I dunno..  i'll try that out tonight.  oh wait...  B button is for items..  i shall consult the instruction manual.</p><p>Anyways, I still prefer the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess for a few reasons.  1) It was designed and developed to take advantage of the Gamecube, whereas the Wii is just a port.  The whole mirrored world thing is pure proof of that, which removes the traditional left-handed Link.  2) The sword swinging feels too loose, and lacks the precision that a simple button push provides on the Gamecube.  and 3) I'm probably bias towards the Gamecube version because i played through it before the Wii version.</p><p>I dunno.  I think that if i had played the Wii version first, i probably would've liked the feel of the controller better, but be annoyed about the aiming schema. :shrugs:  I guess we'll see what happens...  It's still the great amazing game you must play if you own a Gamecube or a Wii.  Quite possibly the BEST gamecube game ever made. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wii Play" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wii-play">Wii Play</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, Nintendo released a simple game for the Wii with a similar release style as was the case with Wii Sports.</p><p>Wii Play is just 9 simple little 'flash' style games that are 'guaranteed' to build your skills using the full capabilities of the Wii-mote.</p><p>These 9 games are:<br/>Duck Hunt<br/>Memory<br/>Some weird bubble game<br/>Ping Pong<br/>Air Hockey<br/>Pool<br/>Fishing<br/>Cow Racing<br/>Pocket Tanks</p><p>There was talk of this game being difficult to find, and it was a nintendo release, so i figured that i should look into picking it up. Part of this rarity stems from the game being packaged with an additional Wii-mote. The game is priced at $50, with a $40 controller.</p><p>Anywho, when i got to Best Buy yesterday, they actually quite a large pile of them. I was kinda surprised with the frenzy i've seen about the Wii.</p><p>I got home, and started playing through some of the games...</p><p>ugh... Each and everyone of these games are shallow, and they don't offer new or innovative gameplay. It's like a bunch of unpolished tech-demos Nintendo scraped off the floor into a bag. I played it for about 2 hours yesterday with my roommates, and i'm honestly bored of it already.</p><p>The other problem with this game is it's only 2 player. I probably would've gotten a couple more hours of enjoyment out of this game if they added 4 player support.</p><p>Honestly, if you want a bunch of stupid games that test your wii-mote skills buy <span style="font-weight: bold">Rayman</span>. Rayman has about a ba-gillion mini-games which actually require skill, uses the wii-mote is many different ways, has decent graphics, and occasionally is funny.</p><p>The only going for Wii Play is that it equates to a $10 game, and comes packaged with another controller for your Wii.</p><p>It's hard to pass up though. I think that even if i read this, i'd probably still buy it because, hell... it's $10 for something to play on my Wii and another controller.</p><p>:shrugs: oh well....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-2">Twilight Princess (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>hurrah..  i just beat Zelda at 41 hours.</p><p>So many aspects of this game pay homage to 'A Link to the Past' and 'Ocarina of Time'. After playing through Twilight Princess, it really feels like Twilight Princess is the next milestone or progression in The Legend of Zelda series. It adds so much more to the franchise than i thought Wind Waker did.</p><p>As a whole, it feels like there are 4 main Legend of Zelda games: The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess. All the other ones feel like side stories.. different takes on the series, in gameplay, setting, and story.</p><p>Anywho... i think one of the main strengths of Twilight Princess is it's nostalgic feel. But, i also feel like that really holds it back at the same time. The 'video-gamey' sound effects really break the reality in my opinion.</p><p>The music is kinda the same way. Some of the best music in the game are newly composed tracks for the dungeons. Some of the later ones have a very wicked unworldly feel. The nostalgic tracks are just the same symphonically composed songs you've heard over and over again. I think they would've been more successful if the old melodies were subtly inserted into newer compositions.</p><p>but..... whatever ^_^.  Twilight Princess is pretty damn amazing.  Certainly worth the wait.</p><p>I should probably order a year of Nintendo Power so i can get the Soundtrack while it's still available... hmmm... i wonder if i could just buy the soundtrack from the nintendo store instead.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 31, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>oh my good lord, i love this game..</p><p>before coming back to the states, i ordered a copy online since they had been several rumors that the gamecube version was going to see a very limited release. of course, upon being in the states, i've seen copies all over the place for gamecube. in fact, it's easier to find on gamecube than on the wii.</p><p>anyways...</p><p>after getting stuck in Portrait of Ruin, i decided to start my game of zelda and i finally put down the controller after 14 hours.</p><p>this game is phenomenal.</p><p>the graphics are beautiful. the charcters, the environments, everything looks amazing.. it is very similar to Shadow of the Collosus, though, actually, shadow has a more realistic natural feel to it. Zelda still retains the cartoony unrealistic feel thanks to character design, which i think takes away from the majestic nature it tries to portrey.</p><p>the story is rather wicked and darker than most other Zeldas, as to be expected from all the hype. The notion of darkness engulfing hyrule is presented with eerie sounds and an ambient supernatural soundtrack. darkness, in the case of twilight princess, is known as twilight, which is where the title derives it's name from. the animation and graphics compliment the sound beautifully.</p><p>link has the most expression out of any previous game. despite that fact he still does not speak on screen, he has an amazing range of emotions that will still convey his dialogue for the story. he shows empathy, disgust, and madness throughout the story, so far, which are emotions i've never felt from a previous zelda game.</p><p>the gameplay is good old legend of zelda style. same old, same old. no jumping. the dungeons and puzzles so far, have been quite entertaining.</p><p>one thing they've added that i've wanted in zelda game ever since Ocarina of Time was a time gauge that told me how long i've played the game.</p><p>anyways... i can't really remember the last time i played a game for 14 hours straight, still wanting more. i only stopped because i was getting hungry, and wanted to eat something a little more substantial than chips.</p><p>after 14 hours through the game i've only made it to the 3rd dungeon. in standard zelda style, they are usually the first 3 dungeons, then you fight something in hyrule castle. After that, something crazy happens to the world, and you must trek through another 8 dungeons. Unfortunately, the 8 dungeons is where Wind Waker failed. though we've been promised by nintendo that there are more dungeons in Twilight Princess than any previous zelda game. that would make Twilight Princess a pretty goddamn long game.</p><p>anyways... i love this game and won't be playing Final Fantasy XII or any other unplayed game sitting on my shelf for a little while longer. wheee</p><p>by the way..  i named link "Billy" and the horse, epona, "Blacky" to experience Twilight Princess in true Crystania fashion.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS Lite is scarce" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-lite-is-scarce">DS Lite is scarce</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
