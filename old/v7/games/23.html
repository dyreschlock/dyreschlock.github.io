| March 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Contact was released by Atlus in the states around the middle of september last year.  Sadly, I missed this release by a couple days when my plane left for planet japan.  I picked it up about a week before my next trip to japan, so I would have plenty of time to devote to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Contact follows the mis-adventure of the professor.  The professor ship had been shot by another spaceship knocking his energy crystals to the earth.  As he crashes to earth his path is crossed with our main character, Terry.  The professor plucks Terry from his daily life and pulls him into the conflict.  Now Terry will help reclaim these crystals as you guide him!</p><div class='title'><b>Art Style</b></div><p>What initially drew me to Contact was the art style.  The world of contact uses vibrant colors in fairly realistically concepted environments.  As a contrast, the world of the professor is a 16 bit throw back.  In essence Terry lives in the graphical age of today's sprite world; whereas, is stuck back on super nintendo.  When playing Contact, the professor's 16 bit world is always on top commenting on Terry's action while you guide Terry in the real world below.</p><div class='title'><b>Oh Comedy</b></div><p>The professor may seem stuck in the past, but he's pretty up on the internet.  The game manual is page after page of his live journal entries.  The real comedy gold are the references in his comments, though they do become quite short and repetitive.  Occasionally when you kill something easy, he'll say 'weaksauce.'  When you traverse the military compound, he'll make an 'all your base' reference.</p><p>The comedy is undoubtedly Contact's greatest appeal.  The story itself hasn't gone anywhere in the 5 hours i've played.  It seems to just fuel the game and push it along.  I mean, all you do is go around finding these crystals.  Then again, I had spent some time just leveling and killing townspeople.</p><div class='title'><b>Leveling</b></div><p>Anywho, Contact follows a very MMO style leveling system, as each individual skill is leveled and trained, rather than a set amount of experience.  You have all the normal rpg skills such as strength, stamina, wisdom, and defense, but weapon and magic skills are individual.  You have separate levels for swords, hand-to-hand, and blunt objects; likewise, earth, water, wind and fire elements are separate.  Leveling is pretty easy though..  You just need to use 'em.</p><p>There are other skills to level such as cooking and lock picking.  These skills are specific to the clothes that you wear, which replaces traditional style armor.  Each set of clothes have separate attributes, such as increased evade, increased strength.. But also associated abilities, like cooking and lock picking.  Clothes aren't usually found in chests or markets, though.  They generally require some sort of unlocked event or difficult optional battle.</p><p>Weapons and Clothes aren't the only stat increases.  Replacing a traditional accessory system, Contact has decals.  There are some key 'itemed' key decals, which are different, but you may equip 4 regular decals on Terry.  In the field you'll come across these decals as a '? Decal'.  In your menu, you use the stylus to peal off the decal to reveal it's true identity.  The usual ones i've run across have been stuff like Battle decal or Defense decal.  The stats they boost are drawn at random, so you can really buff up your character.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As for actual gameplay, Contact, once again, acts like an MMO.  You freely walk around, as do mobs.  Some mobs will attack you, while others will leave you alone or even run away.  Terry has a peace mode and a war mode.  While in war mode, you can point at which monsters Terry should vanquish.  You can also kill any npc you want, friend or foe.  One time I walked into a town.  The first guy said, 'hi. Welcome to our town.'  then I laid him to rest with my blade.</p><p>This is another whole aspect of Contact.  Terry can have a good alignment or an evil alignment depending on your decisions, much like Fable.  Killing baddies nets you brownie points, while the opposite does the opposite.  Luckily the game forgives one infraction each time.  It won't deduct negative alignment if your last kill was positive..  You have to do it twice in a row for that to happen.  Same with the other way..  It kinda works like tennis scoring.</p><p>Anyways, Terry also can come across spells and techniques to make life easier.  These use up EP (or whatever it's called) which is collected as you kill things.  Terry starts off with 5 max EP.  Most moves use up 1 or 2.</p><p>Running around killing monsters is pretty boring though.  You walk up to something, go into war mode, and let Terry attack away.  You can pull up the menu at any time and heal him though.  HOWEVER, this introduces another aspect.  You have a ba-zillion different things you can feed Terry to heal him, but some things will take longer to digest.  You can't feed a full stomach, so don't feed terry a bunch of 30HP hamburgers that'll take 5 minutes to get rid of.</p><p>Anywho, killing mobs may be monotanous, but at least boss battles feature some interactivity.  The first boss is some rock monster that throw punches and boulders at you..  Both of which are pretty easy to dodge.  Unlike regular enemies and if you time it right, you can defeat a boss without taking a hit.  Huzzah..</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>Despite it's comedic appeal and depth of gameplay, it does get rather tedious.  Having 20 different adds a bit of depth to the game, but you have to spend some time leveling up all the stats.  It probably wouldn't be so bad, if the gameplay offered more than just going into killing mode to fight.  Some more action style moves would've broken this up..  9aybe they thought they added too much complexity already..  I haven't even touched the cooking part of the game.</p><p>At the moment I cannot definitely recommend this game one way or the other.  I'd need to spend more time to see where the story actually goes..  Though given, the current situations, you probably eventually fight the opposing forces and save the day and the comedy probably won't go any further than the comments the professor makes.</p><p>It's kind of a little gaming gem, but overall, you won't miss it.  Oh well....<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Game Library" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-library">Game Library</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>I ran across a fun thread on the NeoGAF, where people would post all of the games they plan on purchases over the next month, though i think the intent was to post games that had purchased throughout the month..  I thought it was pretty neat.  You can see what people are actually buying, rather than look at sales numbers or just what people are complaining about, or simply what they are playing.</p><p>Concurrently to this, personally, i've been keeping track of all the games i own for well over a year.  I think i inventoried all my games around the Summer of 2004, or sometime in that Fall season.  Actually, maybe it was that christmas break.  Some people at SPAMM had their own game lists, and i knew my game library kicked the ass out of their game library.  So i cataloged.</p><p>Here's the old one: <a href="/pages/games/games2.html" title="/pages/games/games2.html" title="/pages/games/games2.html">http://www.theschlock.com/misc/games2.html</a>.  It worked out pretty well.  All the code is stuffed into one html file, which makes updating and upkeep rather easy.</p><p>Of course, no one really gave a shit..  None the less, i kept it updated and linked it from Cheap Ass Gamer like a bunch of other gaming nerds do.</p><p>In recently months, i had actually been doing something similar to what the NeoGAFers had been doing, but only in comment form..  If you view the source of that page, you'll notice after the more recently entries they have a '//added mm/dd/yyyy' after them.</p><p>I hadn't extended this idea to code or design, but that's what i did yesterday.  I think the NeoGAFers were onto something, so i took it and ran with it.</p><p>Here's the new games list: <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/games2.html</a>.</p><p>The games2.html page is pretty much the same.  The only thing i did was pull out most of the javascript and css into their own files for the other page to share..  <a href="/pages/games/lst/sales.html" title="/pages/games/lst/sales.html" title="/pages/games/lst/sales.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/sales.html</a> is the new file that extends my games list with all my recent purchases.  I also took the idea a little further by adding where i bought the game, and how much it cost.</p><p>Even though, i could probably go back a couple months and fill in information, i think i'm just going to pitch March 2007 as my starting point.  That way it'll be 100% correct, rather than missing a few pieces.</p><p>In the future, it might be fun to start adding in statistic gathering and create Trend graphs and the like.  Before that, i should probably update this with server-side scripting so it loads as fast as possible.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Trauma Center Wii" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/trauma-center-wii">Trauma Center Wii</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>As indicated by the previous articles, a couple of weeks ago i purchased a Wii.  A thread on Cheap Ass Gamer stated that Wal*mart was holding on their shipment of Wii to be released on that coming Sunday.  So, that sunday, i woke up at stupid o'clock in the morning, put on my jacket and drove over to Wal*mart.  It was only 5 minutes away from my house anyways.</p><p>I got their 15 minutes before they opened, and received the number 17 to indicate my place in line.  Apparently, this was more well known than i thought.  They had plenty of Wii machines to go around, though.  I got home and went back to bed for a little while.  Later on that day, we hooked it up and started messing around with Wii Sports, but got bored of it.  I wanted something fun to play that took advantage of the Wii-mote's capabilities.</p><p>I went out and picked up Trauma Center as my first Wii title.  I thought this was rather nostalgic since Trauma Center was also the first title i purchased for my DS.  I got home, put it in, and started to play.</p><p>For some reason, i thought this was a brand new game.  Since the full title of the game is "Trauma Center: Second Opinion", i thought that meant this was Trauma Center 2.  They couldn't really make a sequel of Trauma Center DS, but they could've had more doctors in other parts of the Trauma Center universe.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trauma Center Wii is a port of the DS title.  The story, characters and surgeries are the same fun missions you tackled on the portable venue.  How disappointing..</p><p>They did add another character at the last minute.  When you complete a story arc, you unlock another story with another character.  These missions take full advantage of the Wii controller.  In the first mission, you twist the Wii-mote to place a shattered broken bone back together.</p><p>On its' own, Trauma Center really starves the player.  The gameplay really lends itself to an Arcade setting, but the bulk of time spent in game is reading character dialogue.  The player sits through boring text until they finally get to experience the action and fast-paced setting of the surgery gameplay.  As far as i know, you can't skip this dialogue..  i should look into that.  Unfortunately, if they removed all story and just had a bunch of surgeries, the game wouldn't have any depth.</p><p>The gameplay is where Trauma Center really shines.  You have several different tools that you switch back and forth through while performing the surgery as outlined in the dialogue.</p><p>I'm not really sure which version of Trauma Center i prefer.  In the DS version, you have the extra precision of pinpoint pen strokes on the touch screen, but with the Wii version you have the speed and agility of an extra controller to switch between instruments.</p><p>There are other little differences as well.  On the Wii version, you actually use the defibrillators rather than the nurse automatically doing it for you.  Using the healing touch i've found to be much more difficult, but i think i just need to get used to the timing.</p><p>Anywho, i do love Trauma Center, but there are many downfalls that make it difficult to recommend to people.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-3">Twilight Princess (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This weekend, i finally came across Twilight Princess on the Wii for a cheapy price tag, so i picked it up.  Thinking back, i'm not really sure why.  In the past two months i've started 6 games that i have not finished.  These games would be Portrait of Ruin on DS, Final Fantasy XII on PS2, Cooking Mama on DS, Hotel Dusk on DS, Trauma Center on Wii, and Picross DS on DS.  I've been playing Picross quite a bit, but the other games are becoming lost causes..  Starting ANOTHER game would be foolish right?</p><p>Whatever..  i want a fun Wii game that i can sink time into.  I like the Wii quite a bit, but i'm stuck in Trauma Center, and Wii Sports and Wii Play don't really hold my interest.  The only other game i play quite a bit on my Wii is Gunstar Heroes, but i'm getting my assed kicked on Level 5.</p><p>Anyways..  i bought Wii Twilight Princess and started playing it yesterday.  There's a pretty stunning difference between the gamecube version and the wii version of the game, which everyone already knows about.  Traditionally Link is a left-handed sword wielder, but the vast majority of earth's population are right-handed sword wielders.  Rather than re-code Link's physics or model, they decided to mirror the entire game.  In other words, Right is Left and Left is Right.  Now link is right-handed... i guess.</p><p>I didn't think this would really bother me at all, but i find myself getting lost every now and then when i'm trying to find a house or navigate throughout the world.  Dungeons are pretty easy though, since i hadn't spent nearly the amount of time i have in villages or the world overall.</p><p>The obvious difference is most certainly the controls.  I'm not a big fan of the Wii controls.  Aiming with the slingshot, boomerang, etc is FAR better with the Wii-mote, but sword play is way too flexible.  On Gamecube Twilight Princess, you just hit the B button to slash and beat up things, but on the Wii you swing the Wii-mote back and forth motion which loses a lot of precision.  It's far worse than using an analog PS2 controller for a fighter..  The jousting event took me about half an hour to finally figure out when the sword actually swings when i jerk the Wii-mote to the side.  With the Gamecube controller, you hit the button and Link swings the sword right then.  Precision is key when you come to events based on timing and the Wii-mote doesn't offer that type of precision.  I eventually figured it out, though ^_^</p><p>The other thing that annoys me is the lack of camera views in the Wii version.  On the Gamecube controller the C-button left and right would move the camera left and right.  The C-button up and down would pull and push the camera away from and towards Link.  Unless i'm missing it, there is no camera movement in the Wii version at all.  I've been using the Z button to correct the camera's placement.</p><p>They should've used the D-pad for the view changing, but ended up using that to store weapons.  In this way, Link can have 4 total weapons out at once rather than 3 in the Gamecube version.  The Wii controller is a little disadvantage for button mapping though.  Both controllers have 8 buttons, an analog stick and a D-pad, but the Wii controller lacks that C-button stick on the Gamecube controller.  So, rather than code around this problem, it seems that they just omitted camera controls from the game.</p><p>Unless i'm missing something..  I'm probably missing something..  maybe you can do Camera control with the B button on the Wii.  I dunno..  i'll try that out tonight.  oh wait...  B button is for items..  i shall consult the instruction manual.</p><p>Anyways, I still prefer the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess for a few reasons.  1) It was designed and developed to take advantage of the Gamecube, whereas the Wii is just a port.  The whole mirrored world thing is pure proof of that, which removes the traditional left-handed Link.  2) The sword swinging feels too loose, and lacks the precision that a simple button push provides on the Gamecube.  and 3) I'm probably bias towards the Gamecube version because i played through it before the Wii version.</p><p>I dunno.  I think that if i had played the Wii version first, i probably would've liked the feel of the controller better, but be annoyed about the aiming schema. :shrugs:  I guess we'll see what happens...  It's still the great amazing game you must play if you own a Gamecube or a Wii.  Quite possibly the BEST gamecube game ever made. ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wii Play" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wii-play">Wii Play</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Yesterday, Nintendo released a simple game for the Wii with a similar release style as was the case with Wii Sports.</p><p>Wii Play is just 9 simple little 'flash' style games that are 'guaranteed' to build your skills using the full capabilities of the Wii-mote.</p><p>These 9 games are:<br/>Duck Hunt<br/>Memory<br/>Some weird bubble game<br/>Ping Pong<br/>Air Hockey<br/>Pool<br/>Fishing<br/>Cow Racing<br/>Pocket Tanks</p><p>There was talk of this game being difficult to find, and it was a nintendo release, so i figured that i should look into picking it up. Part of this rarity stems from the game being packaged with an additional Wii-mote. The game is priced at $50, with a $40 controller.</p><p>Anywho, when i got to Best Buy yesterday, they actually quite a large pile of them. I was kinda surprised with the frenzy i've seen about the Wii.</p><p>I got home, and started playing through some of the games...</p><p>ugh... Each and everyone of these games are shallow, and they don't offer new or innovative gameplay. It's like a bunch of unpolished tech-demos Nintendo scraped off the floor into a bag. I played it for about 2 hours yesterday with my roommates, and i'm honestly bored of it already.</p><p>The other problem with this game is it's only 2 player. I probably would've gotten a couple more hours of enjoyment out of this game if they added 4 player support.</p><p>Honestly, if you want a bunch of stupid games that test your wii-mote skills buy <span style="font-weight: bold">Rayman</span>. Rayman has about a ba-gillion mini-games which actually require skill, uses the wii-mote is many different ways, has decent graphics, and occasionally is funny.</p><p>The only going for Wii Play is that it equates to a $10 game, and comes packaged with another controller for your Wii.</p><p>It's hard to pass up though. I think that even if i read this, i'd probably still buy it because, hell... it's $10 for something to play on my Wii and another controller.</p><p>:shrugs: oh well....<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-2">Twilight Princess (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After playing through Twilight Princess, it really feels like Twilight Princess is the next milestone or progression in The Legend of Zelda series. It adds so much more to the franchise than i thought Wind Waker did.</p><p>As a whole, it feels like there are 4 main Legend of Zelda games: The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess. All the other ones feel like side stories.. different takes on the series, in gameplay, setting, and story.</p><p>Anywho... i think one of the main strengths of Twilight Princess is it's nostalgic feel. But, i also feel like that really holds it back at the same time. The 'video-gamey' sound effects really break the reality in my opinion.</p><p>The music is kinda the same way. Some of the best music in the game are newly composed tracks for the dungeons. Some of the later ones have a very wicked unworldly feel. The nostalgic tracks are just the same symphonically composed songs you've heard over and over again. I think they would've been more successful if the old melodies were subtly inserted into newer compositions.</p><p>but..... whatever ^_^.  Twilight Princess is pretty damn amazing.  Certainly worth the wait.</p><p>I should probably order a year of Nintendo Power so i can get the Soundtrack while it's still available... hmmm... i wonder if i could just buy the soundtrack from the nintendo store instead.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess">Twilight Princess</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Zelda still retains the cartoony unrealistic feel thanks to character design, which i think takes away from the majestic nature it tries to portrey.</p><p>the story is rather wicked and darker than most other Zeldas, as to be expected from all the hype. The notion of darkness engulfing hyrule is presented with eerie sounds and an ambient supernatural soundtrack. darkness, in the case of twilight princess, is known as twilight, which is where the title derives it's name from. the animation and graphics compliment the sound beautifully.</p><p>link has the most expression out of any previous game. despite that fact he still does not speak on screen, he has an amazing range of emotions that will still convey his dialogue for the story. he shows empathy, disgust, and madness throughout the story, so far, which are emotions i've never felt from a previous zelda game.</p><p>the gameplay is good old legend of zelda style. same old, same old. no jumping. the dungeons and puzzles so far, have been quite entertaining.</p><p>one thing they've added that i've wanted in zelda game ever since Ocarina of Time was a time gauge that told me how long i've played the game.</p><p>anyways... i can't really remember the last time i played a game for 14 hours straight, still wanting more. i only stopped because i was getting hungry, and wanted to eat something a little more substantial than chips.</p><p>after 14 hours through the game i've only made it to the 3rd dungeon. in standard zelda style, they are usually the first 3 dungeons, then you fight something in hyrule castle. After that, something crazy happens to the world, and you must trek through another 8 dungeons. Unfortunately, the 8 dungeons is where Wind Waker failed. though we've been promised by nintendo that there are more dungeons in Twilight Princess than any previous zelda game. that would make Twilight Princess a pretty goddamn long game.</p><p>anyways... i love this game and won't be playing Final Fantasy XII or any other unplayed game sitting on my shelf for a little while longer. wheee</p><p>by the way..  i named link "Billy" and the horse, epona, "Blacky" to experience Twilight Princess in true Crystania fashion.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS Lite is scarce" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-lite-is-scarce">DS Lite is scarce</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 2, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Since coming to Japan i've purchased a couple games; most of which, i cannot play because i didn't bring that equipment with me.  So far i've purchased..</p><p>XII Stag on Playstation 2 for $5<br/>DDR Extra Mix on Playstation for $18<br/>Rez on Dreamcast for $15<br/>Dragonforce on Saturn for $2<br/>Shining Wisdom on Saturn for $2 (I'm not really sure why anymore...)<br/>Some Kanji game on DS for $35 (oops..)<br/>Rakubiki Jiten on DS for $42<br/>Pokemon Diamond on DS for $42<br/>Chososhu Mecha MG on DS for $18 (after points)</p><p>and probably around $30 on DDR Supernova in the arcade, including the e-Amusement Card.  That kanji game was really the only screw up so far.  I might try to trade it in when i pick up Phoenix Wright II at the end of the month.  I've written a little bit of a review for the Rakubiki Jiten, so here are my thoughts on Pokemon Diamond and Chososhu Mecha MG.<br/>____</p><p>Pokemon Diamond.</p><p>Last Thursday, Pokemon Diamond was released to Japan and sold out sometime on Friday.  When we were walking around on Saturday, a copy of Pokemon Diamond or Pearl was no where in sight.  It's still as popular as it ever was. ^_^  Japan should gets it's second wave of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl this coming Friday, so little kids who missed their chance this past weekend will get another chance to pick it up.</p><p>The language barrier is rather amazing.  Since it's marketed for little kids, Pokemon is all in either hiragana or katakana.  There is no Kanji whatsoever, unless you count the yen kanji.  It's helps me build my reading ability of hiragana and katakana rather well ^_^, though i still don't have the vocabulary to know what's going on.</p><p>Pokemon Diamond plays just like any other Pokemon though, so finding out where to go and what to do is simply a matter of talking to everyone in the town and then venturing forth to places you haven't been yet.  I suppose later on in the game, this will become more of a problem.  Currently though, i've been able to get two badges and defeat Team Rocket twice without getting lost or frustrated because of the language..  It's not like Pokemon has much of a story anyways.  I can read about the new cool Pokemon online somewhere if i want the story.</p><p>Back to the yen, i always wondered what the currency actually was in the game.  When playing Pokemon Emerald, everything was in credits.  100 credits for a Poke-ball, 200 credits for a healing item.  I tried to figure out how much that would be in real-life currency.  Actually, i think about this quite often.  "How much would a Final Fantasy tent cost in real life.."  I mean, you make, like, thousands of dollars in the game.  It's not like the idea of going around killing monsters for a living hasn't crossed my mind before.  Anyways, it's 100 yen for a Pokeball.  That's $1.  What a fricken deal.  I'd buy tons of those, if there was a Poke-mart nearby.  Usually when you beat up some kid in the forest, you win $1 or $2 from him.  That's pretty mean.  It's like stealing milk money from children.  I liked my idea before where 1 poke-credit equalled 1/10 of $1.  Then a pokeball is $10 and a little bit more reasonable considering the amount of technology built in them.</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>The graphical style of Pokemon Diamond is quite impressive.  They have effectively transferred the 2D graphics into a 3D plane without screwing over any of the individual detail you'd find in previous titles.  The 3D plane is evident when you walk around and the foreground actually shifts along with your point of view.  It's a very subtle 3D effect that really looks amazing on the DS.</p><p>In battles the graphical style is alot like Pokemon Emerald, with a little bit more of a watercolor backdrop.  The pokemon still have little animations when they enter, ala Emerald.  This is where the touch screen is actually used.  All the battle commands are presented on the touch screen.  It's like Phoenix Wright, where you can either use the the directional pad and select options, or you can just touch the options to select them.  It's pretty slick.  I can still play pokemon one-handed!!  Whoo hoo...  guess who's driving while playing Pokemon when he returns to the states.</p><p>While walking around, you get a little pokemon gadget that keeps tracks on various data on your second screen.  It can keep track of your steps, the current time, your pokemon HP, and.. on other thing.  It's really helpful to have that info up front, especially the steps if you're trying to hatch eggs.</p><p>Speaking of time, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl use a real-time system, much like Animal Crossing.  When it's night outside, it's night in the game.  When it's day outside, it's day in the game.  My game is a little messed up since my DS is on US time, and i don't really want to change it.</p><p>One thing that i've also liked about Pokemon Diamond is the Pokemon themselves..  They aren't stupid looking, or ugly.  Most of them are ligitimitly cute.  I mean, when you began you have a choice between a leafy turtle, a cute little chilly penguin, or a cute little fire monkey. Awww..  I chose the Chilly Penguin ^_^. The first couple pokemon you face are actually pretty cute too.  There's a cute little bird and a beaver.  I picked up a cute little kitty mouse looking thing near the beginning of the game, which has turned out to be pretty slick too.  I've also been leveling up this Pikachu ripoff.</p><p>So anyways, i've played for about 9 1/2 hours and have beaten two gyms.  I found about 49 pokemon and captured about 29 of 'em.  Well on my way to the new pokemon total of around 500 or something.  I probably won't pick up Diamond or Pearl when they are released in the states, but i'll pick up the remake that combines the two.  Unless, i end up running out of things to play when it comes out.  :shrugs:</p><p>So yeah...  Pokemon Diamond is pretty damn slick, i must say.  It's a great pickup for the DS.<br/>_____</p><p>Chososhu Mecha MG</p><p>I found this game used over at Yamada on Saturday for rather cheap.  $32 is rather cheap for games in Japan.  Plus i had $13 something of store credit there, so i ended up getting it for $19.  Wheee..  that's rather cheap for US standards.</p><p>Mecha MG is basically a mecha game, but it has a rather unique control scheme.  You use the D-pad to move around your mech on the playing field, and then you utilize the touch screen to operate the mech..  Each mech has its own custom console, so you have plenty of different modes and attacks.</p><p>The first mission, you are given a regular 'ol mech that can pick up rocks and move them around.  In the middle of the mission, an enemy mech shows up and you must do away with it.  The console had two controls: a horizontal torso pivot and a vertical pivot.  However, there was a pretty big white-space on the side.  I accidently tapped the empty space, and it began to crack.  So i tapped it alot and it broke away to reveal a button to fire off missiles!  Oh yeah.. ^_^  I tore the hell out of that enemy mecha.</p><p>After the first level, you can move about the world.  It's a pretty linear map and you move about unlocking story points and uncovering missions.  Each mission has 4 difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Superhard, which have an obvious difference.  Defeating a mission will give you some money depending on the difficulty you defeat.  Money can be exchanged for goods and services.</p><p>Though, each level so far has given me a mech to use.  I don't actually own a mech to custom myself..  perhaps i'll get one soon.</p><p>Overall i haven't played it too much, but there is plenty game left.  Since i bought it used, there was some completed data on it at around 38 hours.  I played for about an hour to check it out before getting back to Pokemon.  So far, the game is quite slick is well worth a pickup.  If it doesn't reach the states, i suggest you import it if you can find it for cheap ^_^.<br/>_____</p><p>DDR SuperNova Arcade</p><p>So far during my stay i've spent a bit of cash playing DDR Supernova.  Konami has a card that you can purchase deemed the e-Amusement Card and all the recent Konami arcade games i've come across have used it.  It will save your scores, achievements, and other various data for the games you play.  I've only used it on DDR Supernova, but it can be used on Guitar Freaks V3, Drum Mania V3, Pop 'n Music Fever, this Martian Attack game, and so forth.  For DDR Supernova it will save your scores and rankings for applicable Non-stop mixes.</p><p>Supernova boasts nearly 300 songs that are new and old.  It has about 1/3 new songs for the arcade, and 2/3 revival songs from previous arcade mixes.  Of the 1/3 new songs, 1/3 of those are songs that are new to the arcade, but have been featured in console mixes before.  There's about 70 NEW songs featured in the arcade box.  I'm really interested to see how this compares to the US release of Supernova last week.  I'm really loving Xepher, the Seduction remix, AA, the new Des-Row songs, and the new Max 300 mix.  Otherwise i've been playing Quickening and Tsugaru Apple mix a bit, along with the occasional Paranoia Survivor.  Max 300, Maxx Unlimited, and Legend of Max are included, along with Paranoia Respect ^_^.  No Max Period though.</p><p>Overall, DDR Supernova is pretty slick, but it's missing a couple old songs that i would have liked to see.  I'm really sad that Rhythm & Police is not included, but oh well...  can't have everything.  The Non-stop mixes have been rather uninspired as well..</p><p>It's always fun to go into the arcade and dance up a storm to see the reaction of the japanese nerds playing their Dynasty Warriors game.  I've seen a few people who are pretty good at DDR, but overall, no one has really stepped up to kick my ass other than Kyle.<br/>_____</p><p>So yeah...  these 3 games, along with the Rakubiki Jiten have been my primary games at the moment.  I stopped playing Mario Kart after i defeated the Mirror cc class.  I'll probably get back into that later after i finish up Pokemon.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085"
