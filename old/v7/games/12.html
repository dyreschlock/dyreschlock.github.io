| October 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Brutal Legend is the latest game by Tim Schafer, and stars Jack Black as main character Eddie Riggs.  I think most people probably know this game as "Jack Black's video game."  He definitely has more reach than Schafer, and Black has been in the spotlight for almost all promotion of Brutal Legend.  But, Brutal Legend has Tim Schafer's feel through and through.</p><div class='title'><b>Tim Schafer</b></div><p>Tim Schafer is known for creating games with very solid stories backed by great comedic writing that blends into game design.  His career started at LucasArts in the hay day of PC adventure games.  He co-write and co-designed The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2, and then his role grew larger as he co-directed Day of the Tentacle.  His first true lead role came with <b>Full Throttle</b> in 1995, followed by <b>Grim Fandango</b> in 1998.</p><p>In 2000, he left LucasArts to form his own company, Double Fine Productions.  Their first game was <b>Psychonauts</b> released for PC, Xbox, and PS2 in 2005, which has garnered a very large cult following.</p><p>Psychonauts was my introduction to Tim Schafer.  Unfortunately, I skipped all those great LucasArts adventure games and still haven't gotten back to them.  It was because of its cult following that I finally tracked down a copy in 2007 for Xbox, and it's a pretty hilarious and fun game.</p><div class='title'><b>Psychonauts</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp"  /></p><p>In Psychonauts, you play a child who's been sent to summer camp to learn about psychokinetic powers.  These are taught by the camp counselors.  Trouble arises as many of the kids at the camp have had their brains stolen and have become mindless drones.  Throughout the game you venture into others minds to uncover the mystery and plot.</p><p>Psychonauts has some pretty funny characters with great writing.  The real comedy is the level design of the world's that exist inside of character's minds.  The characters are pretty goofy on the outside.  On the inside, their world is imbued with their theme.  There's a very strict and meticulous character, who's inner world is nothing but a cube.  There's a disco queen, who's inner world is a massive disco dance party.  One of my favorite levels is when you inhabit the mind of a fish, and its world puts you as a monster crushing the city beneath you.</p><p>The game itself is mostly platforming.  The camp is open world, and levels can be revisited to find all the secret crap.  Psychonauts definitely has its problems, but the writing and design created lovable characters and a memorable experience.  Brutal Legend follows that tradition very well but takes that blend of comedy, story, and game design even further.</p><div class='title'><b>Brutal Legend</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp"  /></p><p>For Brutal Legend, Schafer created a medieval world based out of his fandom for Heavy Metal music.  During his interview on Jimmy Fallon, Schafer said that, as a kid, all his Heavy Metal albums would have elaborately designed mountains and worlds of explosions, fire and brimstone.  He wanted to make a game where you could actually walk around in one of these worlds and see what it was like.  You can see that in almost all environments in the game.  The first areas have exhaust pipe trees, and steel bladed branches.  There are massive rock effigies of Band symbols, skulls and bones of gigantic beasts.</p><p>In this land, humans are used as slaves and pitted against one another while the demon lords usurp them for their own power and rule.  You, as Eddie Riggs, rescue these humans and build an army to eventually overthrow their rule.  In the world of Heavy Metal, building an army is a lot like building a band and a fan base.  You recruit headbangers, guitarists, roadies and plenty others.</p><p>The game itself is completely action/adventure, but features many instances where you team up with your troops to attack enemies.  You can command your troops to follow, attack, and defend.  These concepts explode further into a full on RTS battle.  You build merchandise booths over vents to hell to collect fans.  These fans are used to create units for battle.  The battle is won when you destroy the opposing team's stage on the other end of the field.  The RTS battles can also be played against people, which is the Multiplayer mode in Brutal Legend.</p><p>As the game explains, Roadies aren't the ones in the spotlight.  But they do direct and shape much of the concert experience.  If they do their job correctly, no one will even know that they're there.</p><div class='title'><b>Jack Black and casting</b></div><p>Schafer wanted to create an experience that die hard Heavy Metal fans would absolutely love and enjoy.  Also from that Fallon interview, Schafer mentioned that throughout initial production and design, he kept thinking to himself, "man, I hope (noted Heavy Metal super-fan) Jack Black will like our game."  When it came time to actually cast the role of the main character, it was a no-brainer to reach out to Jack Black and see if he'd be interested.</p><p>Many of the other characters in the game are voiced by notable Heavy Metal musicians, such as Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford of The Runaways, and Rob Halford of Judas Priest, all of whom basically play personas of themselves.  Additional voice work includes Tim Curry, Kyle Gass, David Cross, Steve Agee, and Brian Posehn (who actually went to high school with Schafer).</p><div class='title'><b>Heavy Metal</b></div><p>In another interview, Schafer has said that Brutal Legend should cater to Heavy Metal fans, but should not be so niche that the general public won't get most of the references.  I'm not a Heavy Metal fan by any means, but the casting and environments are pretty obvious.  Another interesting parallel which is probably more apparent to Heavy Metal fans, are the subtle comments towards the history of Heavy Metal.</p><p>Brutal Legend begins in present day with Eddie Riggs working with a "Metal" band called Kabbage Boy.  Kabbage Boy is a bunch of teen kid bringing Pop into Metal.  Riggs and another roadie talk about how kids these days just don't understand Heavy Metal and how Metal is dead.  "The early 70s were really the days of Heavy Metal."</p><p>After being sent back in time, the first major story arc is helping Lars (Rob Halford) and Lita (Lita Ford) overthrow current slavedriver, Lionwhyte.  Lionwhyte is a makeup donned pretty boy with massive hair and leather pants, a obvious parody of David Bowie in the 80s.</p><p>Much like those kids in the opening adding horrible current Pop culture into Heavy Metal, David Bowie and other Glam Rock bands did the same back in the 80s.  They were in the music because of the style and dressing up rather than the actual music.  Defeating Lionwhyte/Bowie serves as justice to all Heavy Metal fans out there.</p><p>After defeating Lionwhyte, some story occurs and the main love interest kills herself.  She's consumed and infected with in the Sea of Black Tears and becomes completely emo.  She returns to take you down, dressed in all black with blue skin and heavy eyeliner.  She raises her army from the dead, who are a bunch of emo kids with black hair and spikes.</p><p>Ophellia's return represents the rise of Death Metal in the 90s.  Heavy Metal thought there were finally done with the complete nonsense of Glam Rock, but now they have to deal with something far worse.  Eventually you defeat these emo brats and show that Heavy Metal fans are truly the best.</p><div class='title'><b>The Perfect Package</b></div><p>I'm not sure that this concept would work with any other music genre.  Heavy Metal has a history of branching sub-genres that the core fanbase hates that work as fantastic villains.  Heavy Metal has deep roots in Norse mythology, which paint a vibrant medieval landscape.  There are axes and swords and fire and demons.  Studded arm bands.  Skimpy dressed chicks riding fire beasts..</p><p>Everything in Brutal Legend works within the aspects of the Story, Gameplay and the theme of Heavy Metal.  Schafer may have ran into some problems with Psychonauts, but he definitely learned from them.  <b>Brutal Legend is one of the best designed games in a while</b>, and it never takes itself too seriously.  It's fun to play and fun to watch as well. ^_^</p><p>Definitely play this game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Katamari Forever" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/katamari-forever">Katamari Forever</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 4, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Katamari is a pretty simple game.  You roll up stuff, the Katamari gets larger, and The King of All Cosmos takes your ball of garbage (your Katamari), throws it in the sky and POOF! becomes a planet or a star or some other objects floating around in space.  Usually it's replacing something in space that The King had accidentally destroyed in the prologue story sequence.</p><p>In Katamari Damacy, released in 2004, you did exactly that.  There were 10 core levels to the game.  At the end of each level, you ended up with a larger Katamari than the last.  In the first levels, you were picking up dice, Mahjong pieces, maybe magazines.  Throughout the game, you'd grow larger enough to pick up humans, cars, houses, buildings, mountains, and islands..  In the final level, you'd end up with a Katamari almost 900m in diameter.</p><p>It was a unique game that stood on its own as a single release.  But with great popular, Namco demanded creator Keita Takahashi make a sequel.  He thought about what he would do to further the brand, and in 2005, released We Love Katamari.  The story of We Love Katamari centered on Takahashi's reaction to the outpouring support of Katamari Damacy.  Each level in the game is a request by a fan of Katamari Damacy, and almost all the levels center on unique challenges or environments rather than rolling the large Katamari possible.</p><p>Keita Takahashi said that Katamari should end at We Love Katamari, and went off to do something else with Namco.  Namco continued to milk this cash cow and put Jun Moriwaki as head Katamari game designer.  They released Me and My Katamari on the PSP in 2005/2006, which was god awful.  How can you have a Katamari game without analog sticks?</p><p>In 2007, Namco and Jun Moriwaki released Beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, the true sequel to We Love Katamari.  Unfortunately, Beautiful Katamari was uninspired and felt incredibly empty.  It suffered from numerous principle problems (<a href="/old/v7/beautiful-katamari-impressions" title="/beautiful-katamari-impressions">thoughts from Oct 23 2007</a>), but in its core, it was Katamari (<a href="/old/v7/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts" title="/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts">thoughts from Oct 24 2007</a>).  With the unoriginal story, horrible loading times, and $12 worth of DLC to make the game complete, Takahashi's original gameplay concept will always shine through.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever</b></div><p>2 weeks ago, on the 5 year Anniversary of Katamari Damacy (in the US), Namco released Katamari Forever, the newest Katamari game.  Even though, it's a "new" game, Katamari Forever is a compilation of "greatest hits" of the Katamari franchise.  It's chiefly comprised of levels from Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari.  It has 3 new levels that are unique to Katamari Forever.</p><p>It's strange that they completely ignored levels from Me and My Katamari.  Though, I never really played it because it was too difficult to control.  Maybe all those levels were from We Love Katamari?</p><p>Even though, they're the same levels, Katamari Forever has given them a modern treatment:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>All these levels have been upscaled to full 1080p.  Once you complete the level, you have your choice of 4 separate graphical representations of the level:  Cell-shaded, Wood-grain, Comic Book, and Classic.  I like the new Cell-shaded approach.  All the objects in the environment are clearly visible.</li><br/>	<li>Loading each level is lightning fast and takes 5 seconds at the most.  Unlike We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari, there is absolutely no loading at all during the level, which there shouldn't have been to begin with.</li><br/>	<li>In previous games, when you grew to the next size, the smaller objects would "pop out" of the environment to keep a reasonable amount of objects on screen at once.  With the optimized power of modern hardware, these smaller objects stick around for a little while longer.</li><br/></ul><br/>Katamari Forever has also added 2 new elements of gameplay, which are rather helpful:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>You can jump!  Though, it's a real pain in the ass to use the Sixaxis controls to jump, you can just use the R2 button instead.  It's really handy for getting to places you couldn't previously</li><br/>	<li>Throughout the level, you might find a heart.  There are broken hearts and full hearts.  When you roll one up it will suck up surrounding objects into your Katamari.  In practice, it's much less broken than that sounds.</li><br/></ul><br/>If you don't like these new features, you can roll in "Classic" mode which removes all hearts from the level, and removes jumping.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever Levels</b></div><p>Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari, and Beautiful Katamari each have about 20 or so levels.  Katamari Forever took its levels from that bank of 60, and has a total of 34 levels.  Here's the list of levels you'll find in Katamari Forever</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RoboKing's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Tutorial</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star 1 - Playtime</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Delightful Dirigible)<br/><b>Make a Star 2 - Calories</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Munchies Manor)<br/><b>Make a Star 3 - Rich</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Lady Luck Casino)<br/><b>Make a Star 4 - Constellations</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Hubble Horoscope)<br/><b>Make a Star 5 - Underwater</b> (We Love Katamari - Inner Tube Guy - Underwater Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 6 - Animals</b> (We Love Katamari - Tan Dog - Friend Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 7 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 4)<br/><b>Make a Star 8 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Old Guy - As Large As Possible 3)<br/><b>Make a Star 9 - Energy</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dynaville)<br/><b>Make a Star 10 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 8)<br/><b>Make a Star 11 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Bird/Elephant As Large as Possible 5)<br/><b>Make the Moon</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make the Moon)<br/><b>Katamari Sprinkler</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star - Race</b> (We Love Katamari - Racecar Guy - Racetrack Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star - Danger</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dangerous Colony)<br/><b>Farewell!</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The King's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Gingerbread House</b> (We Love Katamari - Hansel &amp; Gretel - Candy Stage)<br/><b>Clean Up</b> (We Love Katamari - Cleaning Lady - 100 Objects Stage)<br/><b>Cows and Bears</b> (We Love Katamari - Cow/Bear guy - Cow/Bear Stage)<br/><b>Money</b> (We Love Katamari - "Save the Pandas" Guy - Money Stage)<br/><b>Fireflies</b> (We Love Katamari - Studying Guy - Firefly Stage)<br/><b>Sumo</b> (We Love Katamari - Mini Sumo - Sumo Stage)<br/><b>Shopping</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Fancy &amp; Schmancy)<br/><b>School</b> (We Love Katamari - Teacher - School Stage)<br/><b>Camp</b> (We Love Katamari - Campfire Guy - Fireball Stage)<br/><b>Limited to 50</b> (We Love Katamari - Baby - 50 Item Limit Stage)<br/><b>Snowman</b> (We Love Katamari - Snow Guy - Snowman Stage)<br/><b>Hot Stuff</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Roller Roaster)<br/><b>Small Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Small Just-right)<br/><b>Medium Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Medium Just-right)<br/><b>Large Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Large Just-right)<br/><b>Wake up the King</b> (Beautfiul Katamari - Schloss Kosmos)<br/><b>The King's Dream</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p>Katamari Forever has the unique variety of challenges found in We Love Katamari and, to a lesser extent, Beautiful Katamari, along with the growing scale found throughout all the games in the series.</p><p>Unfortunately, the scale is very scattered.  There's no sense of starting off small and eventually growing large from level to level.  By the time you've gotten to "Make a Star 7", which is The House from Katamari Damacy, the first level where you're big enough to roll up humans, you've already rolled up cars in "Cows and Bears" and horses in "Constellations".  Katamari Forever doesn't start building up scale a few levels after that.</p><p>I remember the first time in Katamari Damacy when I rolled up that little girl in The House.  In each level before that, you could roll up small animals, but the game made a point of making humans just a little bit too large for you to capture.  It wasn't until you completed The House, and rolled large enough afterward that you could envelope that girl.  It really made you work for it.  In the next level, you had to work at it again.  This time you could roll up adults, if you made it well past the level's goal.</p><p>Besides being inconsistent, New-comers to the Katamari series will have no concept of this at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Though, this game is really made for the fans.  Most of the best levels from the 3 core games of the franchise are in one spot.  They play and look better than they ever have before, so I can't complain too much.  I no longer have to wait through horrible load times in We Love Katamari or Beautiful Katamari...  I can pop in Katamari Forever and roll away pretty quickly.</p><p>Unfortunately, after a week of playing, I've almost unlocked everything.  Playing these level for a second time is pretty fun, but I've already played them to death in their original games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Katamari Damacy Fanart" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/katamari-damacy-fanart">Katamari Damacy Fanart</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 23, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>5 years ago (yesterday), Namco released Katamari Damacy on PlayStation 2 at a mere $20.  They weren't sure how well it would sell in the states, so they gave it a reduced "budget" price, and let the market take its course.  Sales were slow, but word of mouth spread quickly, and fastly became a cult classic.  In fact, the Katamari Damacy franchise is one of my favorite video games to date.</p><p>I don't think there's any game released in the last 5 years that's as upbeat and quirky as Katamari.  A smile comes across my face every time I start a game.  It's a very zen-like experience to roll around the world and pick up whatever you can.</p><p>There has seen been 4 sequels to Katamari Damacy.  We Love Katamari is the PlayStation 2 follow-up released 1 year later, which polished gameplay and graphics, added variety, and has become the definite Katamari title.  After We Love Katamari, creator <b>Keita Takahashi</b> said he was done with the franchise and started working on new stuff.  That didn't stop Namco, which released a PSP game and then an Xbox 360 game.  Both of which were rather lack luster.</p><p>Yesterday, on the 5th anniversary of Katamari in the US, Katamari finally returns home to the PlayStation console in Katamari Forever on PlayStation 3.  Katamari Forever is part compliation, part remix, and upscale of all the previous releases.  I think they said it was 10% or 20% new material, but it's all these levels in one disc!  Plus, all the levels run in 1080p.  Also, you can change the graphical representation of the levels with separate skins and models.</p><p>I'm a huge fan of Katamari, so it's already purchased and in the mail.  To commemorate the new release, here's my favorite pieces of Katamari fanart I've collected over the past 5 years.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Damashy</b></div><p>by Oekaki Pocket</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOekakiPocket.webp"  /></p><p>After the release of Katamari Damacy in 2004, I came across this picture on the internet.  Katamari's graphics are rather abstract, so it was interesting seeing a realistic approach to what a Katamari ball might actually look like.  When I was doing the Katamari Tshirt design for <a href="http://spamm.org" title="http://spamm.org">SPAMM</a>, I modeled some of my object after this picture.</p><p>I found the Oekaki Pocket website, but I was unable to find a larger version of the picture.  He just has a bunch of loli drawings and sketches on his site now.  Here's the link: <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oekaki/pocket/opo/pocket.html" title="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/oekaki/pocket/opo/pocket.html">Oekaki Pocket: Scribble Works Gallery</a></p><div class='title'><b>Papercraft Prince</b></div><p>by Yuuku</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariPapercraft.webp"  /></p><p>Papercraft was becoming rather popular with nerdy folks on the Internet around 2004 and 2005, so a papercraft version of The Prince became widely linked picture very quickly.  In Fall 2005, when carving a Katamari pumpkin, I finally printed, cut out, and glued together a papercraft Prince of my own, which has migrated from several computer monitors since.</p><p>Here's the original site for the papercraft Prince: <a href="http://fccafe.fc2web.com/ptamacy.html" title="http://fccafe.fc2web.com/ptamacy.html">å¡?é­?ï¼?ç??å­ï¼?ã®ã??ã?¼ã??ã?¼ã?¯ã?©ã??ã??</a> (Katamari Damacy Prince Papercraft)</p><div class='title'><b>"Auto Wash"</b></div><p>by Mac Hall</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariMacHall.webp"  /></p><p>Many webcomics latched onto Katamari Damacy, the same way fan artists did.  I like the Mac Hall entry the best mainly for the art.  Mac Hall is a pretty damn good artist, and his comic doesn't overly shove the comedy of the game in your face that way almost every other comic did.  It's subtle and clean.</p><p>Here's the link to the original: <a href="http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2005-02-21" title="http://www.machall.com/view.php?date=2005-02-21">MacHall - Feb 21st, 2005</a></p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Otaku Planet</b></div><p>by Sudori</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariOtakuPlanet.webp"  /></p><p>Otaku Planet is a much better rendition of the "roll of anime shit" idea that I used for the SPAMM shirt.  The fun thing about Katamari fanart is the amount of detail and references put into the stuff already rolled up into the ball.  You can stare at the thing for a while and continue to pick out new stuff.  Otaku Planet is just that.  Pikachu, Sailor Moon, Rurouni Kenshin, Naruto, Bleach, Domo-kun, Full Metal Alchemist, Card Captor Sakura, Totoro, CLAMP, Final Fantasy, so on and so on...</p><p>Here's the link to Sudori's DeviantArt page: <a href="http://sudoru.deviantart.com/art/katamari-otaku-planet-35539619" title="http://sudoru.deviantart.com/art/katamari-otaku-planet-35539619">DeviantArt - Sudori</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Colossal Katamari</b></div><p>by Snake</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090923_katamari/KatamariColossus.webp"  /></p><p>Shadow of the Colossus is another cult classic Playstation 2 game that was released within the same month as the second Katamari game, We Love Katamari.

| September 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Since the announcement of Star Wars The Old Republic and their lofty plans for a story-driven nature in an MMO, I was definitely intrigued and ready to purchase to see just how they planned on accomplishing that.  Though, Star Wars fan were more excited about the idea of a new Star Wars MMORPG that would probably not suck.</p><p>Star Trek fans had the same excitement early last year when Cryptic Studios announced <b>Star Trek Online</b>.  Cryptic Studios have been responsible for City of Heroes/Villains, a super hero oriented MMORPG that they sold to NCSoft after acquiring the Marvel MMO rights.  Unfortunately Marvel fell through, and they changed the game to Champions Online to directly compete with their previous MMO.</p><p>Cryptic had many demo stations of the recently released Champions Online, but reserved a couple units for Star Trek Online which Five gave a try.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4910.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Star Trek Canon</b></div><p>Between Star Wars and Star Trek, I'm totally a fan of Star Trek.  I watched Star Trek The Next Generation every night before going to bed in High School.  I've seen all the movies, watched almost all of Deep Space Nine and Voyager.  So, while Five tried to figure out the annoying controls, I talked with a demonstrator about the canon of Star Trek in Star Trek Online.</p><p><b>Me</b>: What time period does Star Trek Online cover?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Star Trek Online takes place 30 years after the destruction of Romulus.  If you've seen the most recent Star Trek film, the Murauder and future Spock had journeyed back in time because of those events.  So, Star Trek Online takes place further in time than any Star Trek series or movie.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Can you play as any Star Trek race?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, you can play as any race that has ever appeared in any Star Trek series or movie.  In fact, you can make up your own race if you'd like.</p><p><b>Me</b>: That's weird...</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Weird?!  We at Cryptic think it's pretty cool.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Are there different factions or something?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Yes, in Star Trek Online, you can choose between the Federation and Klingon.  In the Star Trek timeline, the destruction of Romulus cast doubt in the Klingon high council that the Federation had any idea of what they were doing.  Harsh words were spoken, and the Klingon broke off from the Federation.  Many of the events in Star Trek Online focus on that conflict and you can choose your sides.</p><p><b>Me</b>: So, if you're Federation, you just fight Klingons?</p><p><b>Dude</b>: Absolutely not, Star Trek Online goes into all the conflicts with a wide range of Alien races throughout the Star Trek Universe.</p><p><b>Me</b>: Okey Dokey, sounds like fun ^_^</p><p><b>Me thinking</b>: eh, not really.</p><div class='title'><b>Combat</b></div><p>The demo focused completely on Combat.  That's all you really do in an MMO anyways.  Five commanded an Away on a planet's surface and started fighting some Klingons.  The Klingons were pretty weak though :/  This was pretty boring, so he beamed back to the ship and warped to another planet.</p><p>While orbiting another planet, Klingons appeared!  What strife!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_startrek/IMG_4911.webp"  /></p><p>Space combat is pretty interesting and much more involved than clicking on dudes and beating them down with swords or phasers.  Those circular bars around your ship indicate the strength of your shields in those areas.  Depending on where you're taking fire, only those shields will be affected.  So, if you start taking a lot of damage in the rear, you should turn around and take damage from the side or front to even it out.</p><p>Much like every combat in a recent Star Trek, you can totally change the amount of energy put into the shields, or life support, or weapons on the fly!  "Full power to forward weapons!"  That's another thing, depending on the direction you're facing you can only fire aft torpedoes or forward phasers.  It's pretty damn sweet how they integrated very fundamental concepts from Space Battles in the movies or series into the game.</p><p>That being said, it's incredibly annoying to keep everything straight.  At least, it was in the first 5 minutes of the fight.  The races you choose also have an effect on evasive maneuvers and other things.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This game is pretty stupid.  I don't really see any point to it at all unless you're an absolute fan of Star Trek.  Creating your own race would be fun to fill in the gaps that Cryptic missed, but overall it's just a level grind.  The story sounds boring as crap with scrolling text relaying anything important.  I'm not going to pay attention to that.</p><p>The Space Combat was kinda neat though, but that's the only positive I got from the demo and it's really only a novelty to recreate battles from episode of Next Generation.</p><p>Star Trek Online releases for the PC sometime next year, if not 2011.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Split Second Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-split-second-hands-on">PAX 09: Split Second Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Returning home on Saturday, Ace asked a pretty important question regarding the nature of PAX.  <b>Were there any games you saw or played that you had no intention of buying until after you saw or played them?</b> Every company exhibiting games at PAX was there for the sole purpose of selling their game.  They weren't there for fun.</p><p>This has happened a couple times in the past.  In 2007, after seeing Mass Effect in action, I was sold.  Last year, Castle Crashers completely changed my mind and I bought it on the spot.</p><p>This year, that game would have to be Split Second.  Though, I wouldn't say it put me in a buying mood.  It definitely caught my eye and I totally want to play more of it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4882.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Racing!</b></div><p><b>Split Second</b> is a racing game, but has some elements that reminds me of the Burnout series.  In your effort to finish first, you can knock out your opponents by causing explosions and considerably changing the environment of the racetrack.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4884.webp"  /></p><p>Throughout the race you build up that blue/red meter underneath your car.  It'll build up fast when you knock out opponents, catch some air, drift around corners, and any other fancy driving.  As the Blue meter fills up, icons will flicker in the surrounding environments when you can cause explosions to take out your opponents.</p><p>Once you fill two Blue meters, the third meter is Red.  Once the red meter is complete full, you can cause some serious explosions.  Like blowing up the flight control tower and crash it onto the race track.  Or blow up the road underneath your opponents exposing an underground promenade.  Or summon a 747 airliner crashing while trying to land on the runway.</p><p>The environmental effects of a Red explosion are huge and cause the landscape of the racetrack to change.  When you blow up the control tower, it blocks the track and racers need to go through hangers.  When you blow up road, you fall into a lower version of the track.  The changes create shortcuts, and more difficult areas.</p><p>Also, all the racers can blow up shit in the environment, not just you.  Things are blowing up all over the place once the computers think you're winning too much.</p><div class='title'><b>No HUD</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_splitsecond/IMG_4885.webp"  /></p><p>One other very interesting thing about Split Second is the absence of a HUD (or Heads-up User Display).  There's no information on the corners of the screen.  As you can see from the screen shot, the place, laps, and explosion bar are tapered on the back of your car, which gives a very different driving experience than any other racer out there.</p><p>It's actually a pretty smart move since you need to pay attention to the environment around you, just as much as the cars in front of you.  The HUD would just get in the way.  And now you can see everything quite clearly.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Split Second is brought to you by Black Rock Studio, whose previous titles include Moto GP, Pure, and Hot Wheels Stunt Track.  Their past includes all racing games, but none of which have really made a name for them.  Split Second is definitely different, but could get repetitive very fast.</p><p>It was announced earlier this year, and should be release sometime in 2010.  Even though, it surprised me and I played it several times throughout the weekend, I don't plan on buying it.  It'll be at the top of my GameFly list, but I am skeptical the amount of enjoyment I'll get out of Split Second after playing it for 2 or 3 weeks.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-the-brodeo-live-reunion">PAX 09: The Brodeo Live Reunion</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 9, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One year ago in two weeks, my favorite podcast recorded it's final episode, and did not return to the Internet.  The Brodeo starred 1up staffers Sean Malloy, Ryan Scott, Sean Elliot, Jeff Green, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.  On September 11th, 2008, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and on September 18th, Sean Elliot did the same.  I wrote a little bit about it on that day: <a href="/old/v7/the-brodeo-is-over" title="/the-brodeo-is-over">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=491</a>.</p><p>It was my favorite because they had the perfect blend of serious game discussion and deconstruction, mixed with clever humor and ridiculous bizarre stories.  Jeff Green spoke very candidly and honestly about his life and thoughts on games.  Shawn Eliott would regale ridiculous stories from the past, while going into depth about ideas and game design.  Robert Ashley would provide great commentary and further insight into the conversation.  Ryan Scott...  wouldn't say much.  Anthony Gallegos was a goof ball.</p><p>This round table always made the conversation revolve in the right direction that was entertaining and thought provoking.  If you haven't listened to GFW Radio, definitely check out all the previous episodes.  Yes, it's a PC podcast, but PC gaming is a very small component of what makes the podcast so great.  All the podcasts are still hosted at 1up.com's <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3148397">GFW podcast page</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>The Fans</b></div><p>Being at The Brodeo reunion was a reunion for everyone in the room.  It wasn't just a reunion for the Brodeo members, but all the fans, too.  All the fans listened, laughed, and thought in unison while The Brodeo talked about Diapered Anime fans, working in Game Development, playing games no longer being Journalists, Smoking poop, and the Truth behind GFW Magazine's end.</p><p>The Brodeo crew have a very unique voice, but the fans really bring out the best in them.  In fact, it was fan Aaron Simmer who contacted all the Brodeo members, raised money to fly them to PAX, created the Panel, reserved the room, and organized the entire event for them.

The demo had been out for quite a while, and the game just came out that week.  It didn't really need advertising or a large presence.  There was a life-sized Big Daddy statue and several demo units, but that was about it.</p><p>This year, Bioshock 2 had a pretty small presence, but what they had was rather unique.  2k Game hired a chalk artist to sketch a poster in front of the main halls.  Throughout the entire weekend, the artist worked on transposing the tiny print into a massive 8 foot mural.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4869.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4900.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4902.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Jhonen Vasquez</b></div><p>Earlier in the year, Jhonen Vasquez, creator of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, Squee, and Invader Zim, drew a picture that captured the twisted essence of the little sisters and their bigger guardians.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4932.webp"  /></p><p>2k Games brought Vasquez to Comic-Con in July (even though he would already be there for Slave Labor Graphics), and they did the same with PAX.  On Saturday, from 2pm to 4pm, Vasquez sat in Andrew Ryan's office signing these prints.  The one above is the one I got. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, Vasquez was only signing these prints and was not signing personal items. That's fine, since I didn't have any of that with me anyways.  I would love his signature on the side of my Invader Zim box set, or on the inside cover of Johnny or Squee.  Someday, but unfortunately, not today.</p><p>I did get my photograph taken with him...  sort of.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4876.webp"  /></p><p>In the background is his handler.  I did ask him if Vasquez could sign anything else, but he was the one that kindly told me, "no, sorry."  I chatted with him a little bit about when I might be able to get his signature and he suggested Comic Con next year.  Bahh...</p><p>If you were to guess what Vasquez's handler's voice sounded like, would you think it would be a deep rough lumberjack of a voice?  Perhaps a strong authoritative dialogue?  I'm afraid not.  His voice was straight out of Suburban Commando.  Semi-high pitched, with a very rich English accent, recanted with an apologetic smile.  Is that a typical voice for such a burly man in England?</p><p>I wonder if Vasquez attends comic conventions other than Comic Con.  Comic Con sounds like a shit load of lines, and huge price guaging.  I'm not even sure I would buy anything there, as I already have all the comics I need.  Plus, I hate Superhero comics, so it probably wouldn't be fun for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Bioshock errata</b></div><p>Those two events were really the only presence of Bioshock 2 at PAX.  There was a room in teh back that showed the E3 trailer over and over.  Those that watched the trailer were rewarded with a Bioshock 2 posters draw by Gabe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_bioshock/IMG_4934.webp"  /></p><p>It's hilarious comparing Gabe's drawing to Jhonen Vasquez's print.  Cute v. Creepy.  Calm v. Twisted.  <b>The ying and yang of Bioshock 2 art.</b><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Behemoth and Game 3 Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-behemoth-and-game-3-hands-on">PAX 09: Behemoth and Game 3 Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The revenue generated from their booth at PAX directly funds their upcoming games.  It's win/win.</p><div class='title'><b>Castle Crashers</b></div><p>Last year, having just released Castle Crashers, their merchandise was almost all focused on Castle Crashers.  They were selling shirts, figures, and the game.  I bought the full game from them last year that came with a fancy pewter medallion and a code for the game.  It was certainly more tangible that simply buying it through Xbox live.</p><p>Castle Crashers was definitely my favorite downloadable game last year.  After buying the game at PAX 08, we played it so much that I missed my flight home!  <a href="/old/v7/pax-castle-crashers" title="/pax-castle-crashers">Read all about it</a>.  This year I continued my patronage and purchased a statue of my favorite Castle Crashers character (for sale): The Red Knight.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp"  /></p><p>Steam Knight is actually my favorite, but they haven't made a figure for him.  Dan Paladin was at the Behemoth booth, so I asking him if he would sign my spiffy figure.  And he did!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp"  /></p><p>Also, there was a Castle Crashers cosplayer at the booth.  I'm pretty sure it was one of their friends or wives and not just a random fan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Game 3</b></div><p>The Behemoth booth had 4 stations setup.  One had PS3 Castle Crashers, and the other one had Game 3 setup on the Xbox.  I gave it a try and it seems like it might be fun.</p><p>Each game developed by Behemoth has been in a different genre, mostly in the retro realm.  Alien Hominid was a 2D sidescrolling shooter, ala Contra or Metal Slug.  Castle Crashers was a brawler ala Final Fight and TMNT.  But, Game 3 doesn't fall into a specific genre.</p><p>It's very much a multiplayer action game.  Again, it seems like it'll be fun, but I didn't really have that much fun with it at PAX.  The game mode we played had a floating whale that gave out coins.  You pick up as many coins at possible and deposit them in a floating bank.  The opposing team can knock you out and steal your coins, so be careful!  It was simple, and didn't have much more to it other than jumping around.</p><p>I love the art, though.  You can choose your head, face and weapon.  The faces range from stern to excited to intense.  The weapons can be defensive or offensive.  I played with a fan, which repeled most projectile weapons.</p><p>The Behemoth's Development Video #1 shows exactly how the game is played.  I didn't get much more out of the game having already seen this video.

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mass Effect has been the only RPG in recent years that actually hooked me.  Fallout 3 I found boring and dismal.  Fable II was ugly and too ridiculous.  JRPGs (except Final Fantasy XII) haven't had a unique or different story for quite a while.  But Mass Effect was a little different.  It was a fully realized NEW Sci Fi universe, much like Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, etc, etc.</p><p>There are very few games that create an in-depth detailed universe for their game that aren't in the MMO space.  There are even less that have a decent story that unravels through a decent plot and utilizes many aspects of that lore.  There's a lot of lore fluff that doesn't matter for the story of Jonathon Shepherd, but I find myself more interested in reading about these alien races, than some ancient Orcs v. Human battle in the WOW lore.  I think alien races have always intrigued me because they are so different from us, but still have the capacity for intelligence.</p><p>I'm quite excited for the sequel, so I was glad to get the chance to check it out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>One thing that was goofy about Mass Effect 1 were the dialogue scenes.  The dialogue wasn't goofy, but the way in which it presented always had a profile shot of who was talking.  That was the only shot they ever used, and it got boring fast.</p><p>The dialogue in Mass Effect 2 has a lot going on in the background.  The shots are more dynamic and have more interaction that just conversation.  For example: At the beginning of the demo, you hold a conversation in a car while flying to your destination.  The only interaction you have is conversation, but the shots change from a close-up in-car to a wide shot of the city's traffic, to a closer shot outside the car with character visible through the windows.  It's a varied and shows off how beautiful the environments are.  It's far more interesting that two people standing side-by-side holding a conversation.</p><p>The conversations towards the end of the demo has a whole lot of body movement and gestures that really enhance the actually dialogue.  It's like an actual movie now!</p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>Another "gamey" thing about the dialogue that has been altered is that the conversation choices are not so black and white.  After a while of playing Mass Effect 1, you'll realize that the 3 conversation choices on the right go in order of Good, Neutral, and Evil.  If you want to be good in the game, you'll most likely always say the top choice.  For evil, the bottom choice.  Why ever choose the middle?</p><p>It wasn't so easy to tell if the top choice was actually the "Good" choice towards the end of the demo.  In fact, choosing the top choice invoked a battle that I found out could have been avoided.  Maybe it was the Good choice and I appeared weak?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Other Thoughts</b></div><p>The demo was very very pretty.  It was pretty dark, but featured a rich color palette the made areas look very dynamic and cool.  A very Sci Fi style that is much more prevalent than the first game.  It looks great. ^_^</p><p>The action sequence also felt much different than Mass Effect 1.  I actually needed precision and strategy when fighting all the enemies, rather than blowing them all away with my sniper rifle or using my team as decoys.  It was kinda difficult.  I should've checked which class I was playing.</p><p>But overall, the game is pretty sweet.  It takes what made the original special and takes it to the next level and other box quotes.</p><p>Mass Effect 2 releases for Xbox 360 and PC in "Early 2010".</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/13">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/11">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
