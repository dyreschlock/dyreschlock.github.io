| September 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This evening marks the release of one of the most anticipated games of all time, Halo 3.  It's a strike for western gaming in the console market.  When Microsoft began treading into Console territory, would anyone had guessed that their IP would be the number one best selling pre-order of all time?</p><p>To mark this event further, Best Buy announced several midnight releases at their stores throughout the country.. One of these stores just happened to be a few blocks away from my house, here in Madison ^_^.</p><p>After watching the season premiere of Heroes, Tony graciously joined me in line in front of Best Buy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" /></p><p>At 9pm, the line really wasn't all that long at all.  Tony and I parked at the end and played some Pacman Vs. on DS.  I was actually surprised that one other person in line actually had a DS, but I wasn't so surprised that most of the other avid Xboxers were tossing around a football and yelling obscenities at each other as loud as they could.  It also didn't surprise me when one of their friends drove on by with Rap music blasting out of their car speakers.</p><p>2 hours went by pretty quickly. After Tony beat me 3 out of 5 matches in Pacman, I tried to write up my Phoenix Wright article but got distracted really easy by Wikipedia and other various pieces of information on the internet.  Apparently Wisconsin has a state fossil..  it's a trilobite.  Minnesota, on the other hand, does not have a state fossil -_-;;</p><p>At 11 o'clock, one of the managers came outside with blue tickets for the Halo 3 inflatable chairs..  It just so happens that Tony and I were at the dead end of receiving the tickets. ^_^.  Hot damn..  Waiting 3 hours in line was just the trick to getting 1 of 25 chairs.</p><p>But these chairs were only given to those who purchased the game, so Tony was 1-up on the other people ahead of us in line who missed their opportunity to grab a ticket.  One lucky fellow, purchased his ticket for a whole $5!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0489.webp" /></p><p>Now that we were up, I started walking around to get a look at the line.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0493.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0492.webp" /></p><p>When midnight rolled around, it was just about time to get inside..  A few minutes before hand, I went back into the parking lot and got another picture of the line.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0499.webp" /></p><p>At 11pm, the line extended to a little bit passed the end of the sidewalk, but now the line went all the way back.  Nearly to the entrance of Kohl's.</p><p>At Midnight o'five, we finally got to go into the store..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0500.webp" /></p><p>Pre-orders to the left, non-pre-orders to the right.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0502.webp" /></p><p>Just a little more waiting in line, and then Halo 3 was mine.  I missed my opportunity to grab a shirt, but Tony had accidentally gotten 2, so he let me have his extra ^_^.</p><p>After purchasing Halo 3, I redeemed my inflatable chair, and we were off..</p><div class='title'><b>The goods</b></div><p>So...  for $70 and 3 hours of my time, I had gotten the following things:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0504.webp" /></p><p>Halo 3 Limited Edition, Halo 3 T-shirt, and a Halo 3 Inflatable chair...  which I will probably never open.</p><p>The Halo 3 Limited Edition is amazingly cheap.  The "metal" tin is so delicate and flimsy, I could easily dent the thing.  It's the flimsiest game box I've ever held, honestly..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0505.webp" /></p><p>Both my game disc and extras disc were jarred free in the game, but did not suffer any damaging scars due to its uncare..  So I should be able to play the game with no problem tomorrow after work.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0506.webp" /></p><p>Besides the extras disc, it also came with all you see here.  Instruction manuals, advertisements, and a hardcover "art" book, which is really more of a technical details book that lays out all the information about the races, planets and vehicles in Halo.</p><p>meh..  Hopefully the extras disc is worth it..  Right now, I'd almost rather have the regular edition of the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0508.webp" /></p><p>I took a little peak at the Inflatable Chair, but put it right back into its box.  It might be a pretty fun pool toy ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>Bedtime!</b></div><p>So there you have it..  I have Halo 3, and will be playing it with Justin, tomorrow.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This is Squaresoft's first RPG on the PSP, and it is making history..  It is also the first PSP Title to ever have a massive line outside of Yodobashi Akihabara the day of its release.</p><p>This PSP is limited to a mere 77,777 copies making collectors, fans and video game ethusiasts go nuts.  Most retailers sold them at $100 markup..</p><p>Included in this fantastic pack is Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core, a buster sword Cellphone strap..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0440.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0440.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0441.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0441.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0441.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0442.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0442.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0442.webp" /></p><p>.. and the new slim and lite PSP-2000!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0443.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0443.webp" /></p><p>with Final Fantasy VII graphics on the back of it..  looks like I've got number 30,785 out of 77,777.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Slim</b></div><p>I know everyone has already talked about this to death, but I think I'll weigh in a little bit myself..  The new PSP is amazingly light, just like everyone has said.  The buttons have been revamped and feel very very fluid..  The don't feel hard and unresponsive like they do on the original.</p><p>It feels really really good ^_^.</p><p>There's actually a slight difference in the screens..  but only slight.  Tony and I powered up both PSPs and set them up for comparison.  The new PSP's screen is a bit more crisp, whereas the old PSP's screen is somewhat muddy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0446.webp" /></p><p>The new PSP is quite nice ^_^..</p><div class='title'><b>Gaming in the upcoming week</b></div><p>However, when the hell am I going to find time to start playing games on it?  Currently, I'm in the middle of 2 games: Oblivion and Phoenix Wright 3.  Since starting Oblivion, I haven't touched Phoenix Wright 3, which is making things difficult.  I want to finish up Phoenix Wright 3 and get it out of the way before Halo 3 comes out next week, but I also want to enjoy Phoenix Wright 3..  I find it somewhat annoying that I'm putting so much emotion stock into Halo 3.....</p><p>Phoenix Wright 3 is a bit better than its previous game, but it's just as boring..  I really only want to progress through the game to the full grasp of story and finish off that series.  I think this weekend, I'm really going to have to power through it, and write my peace on it.</p><p>Getting into Oblivion wasn't the greatest idea either...  I figured that I would just play it for a couple hours and then stop cold turkey because of how crappy it is.. but unfortunately, it is actually better than I thought, and I'm having fun with it ^_^.</p><p>On top of these two games, I want to give Final Fantasy VII a go, and have been waiting to play Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.. but maybe they'll have to wait.  There's a slew of other PSPs games I also want to start playing, too.  Check out my PSP shelf..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" /></p><p>Not bad, huh?  All these games were purchased between $10 and $15, too.  See.. I can still be a cheap ass when the opportunity arises.  There's still a couple PSP games out there that need to drop in price..  like Parappa, Crush, and Innocent Life.</p><p>I'm going to stick to my 2-game policy to prevent myself from burning out.  I must beat Phoenix Wright over the weekend to make way for Halo 3 on Tuesday.  I think when I'm waiting in line for Halo 3, i'll probably play a little more Brain Age 2.</p><p>Anyways, feel free to complain about how much I spend on video games in the comment section. ^_^  I'm going back to Oblivion.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rock Band US Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rock-band-us-tour">Rock Band US Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 13, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As part of the Rock Band release this holiday season, MTV is rolling trucks around the US promoting the Rock Band atmosphere of the game up on stages.  Rock Band, by the way, is a rhythm game by Harmonix, the creators of Guitar Hero.  Rock Band has 4 "instruments": Lead Guitar, Bass, Drums and Vocals.  Form your own video game Rock Band this christmas season!</p><p>Rock Band seems like it'd be pretty fun in the atmosphere they are presented with this stage and crowds.  You really get to live out your fantasy as a rock legend with your Guitar Hero skills.  However, I don't really see THAT atmosphere transferring to the home what-so-ever.  How is playing with 4 people in the same room with a crowd of a couple people compare against playing by yourself with 3 other friends online?  It can't compare at all.</p><p>Rock Band is a purely social game that can only be played with a dozen people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rock Band Tour hits Milwaukee</b></div><p>Anyways, back on topic..  The Rock Band Tour just kicked off this week, and one of their first destinations was Milwaukee.  These tour dates can be found on Rock Band's website: <a href="http://rockband.com" title="http://rockband.com">http://rockband.com</a>.  The tour dates for Milwaukee are incredibly vague though..</p><p>Thu 9/13 - UW-Milwaukee Campus - TBA<br/>Fri 9/14 - TBA<br/>Sat 9/15 - Best Buy - Location TBA<br/>Sun 9/16 - Best Buy - Location TBA</p><p>O_o..  Way to organize yourself MTV.  With no indication of time or exact place, I decided to make a day of it anyways and got Tony to come with me ^_^.  I called up Jin, a former UW-Platteville student, now UW-Milwaukee student, if he had any more information, and also if he wanted to join us.</p><p>Jin had no idea what I was talking about, "No.. I haven't seen anything around campus advertising it or anything indicating anything at all."  Hmm...</p><p>While at work today, he gave me a phone call to say that he knew someone that had spotted the Rock Band truck on campus, back in the Klotche Center parking lot.  Huzzah!  Information..  It pays to know people all over the place ^_^.   With the location in hand, and the road ahead.. Tony and I left Madison around 4.30p and took off to UW-Milwaukee to check out the Rock Band Tour.</p><div class='title'><b>UW-Milwaukee</b></div><p>Getting to UW-Milwaukee wasn't too bad..  I missed one turn that cost us about 10 minutes, and then finding a parking spot took another 10 minutes.  We got to the Klotzche Center to notice the Rock Band Truck!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" /></p><p>The truck was all locked up though, and the canvas was pulled down..  They were certainly closed, but it seemed ready to open at some point.  I figured they were going to do a night event with fog lamps, lasers..  the whole works!  "Well...  let's go find something to eat and then come back.. maybe they'll be open then."</p><p>Tony and I walked across the Milwaukee campus to find some food.  The whole UW-Milwaukee campus is very cramped together, stuck on 3 main blocks in northern Milwaukee..  like 5 minutes north of downtown Milwaukee.  It has all the college buildings stuck together on a block, and all the residence halls stuck together on a block..  So much college in such a little space, gave me a really weird feeling..  it didn't really feel like an actual University to me.  :shrugs:</p><p>Anyways, after dinner, I gave Jin a call to ask him what he was up to and what his plans were.</p><div class='title'><b>Disappointment</b></div><p>Apparently, the Rock Band thing was going on all day and actually ended around 4 or 5pm..  So we missed it.</p><p>There was so many things wrong with their whole setup in the first place, though.  As Jin pointed out to me, There was absolutely no advertising for this events AT ALL.  It was basically word of mouth which didn't work.  In addition, the Klotzche Center parking was on the far edge of campus behind the building in a parking lot only fit about 20 cars..  as you can see from the photo above.</p><p>Also, according to Jin, all the "roadies" MTV hired to help out with setup and, perhaps, advertising, were mainly hired from madison.  These people got totally trashed the night before hand, and simply stiffed the morning crew.  They didn't even show up, so the few people left had a very rocky morning having the setup everything themselves.</p><p>As these failing factors resulted in poor turnout and an overall failure of the event.  I suppose if they had their act together they probably would have still been open by the time Tony and I arrived.</p><p>Booooooooo.</p><p>Well, i'm sure they'll have far better results when setting up for a Best Buy store..  They'll have paid employees to give a hand..  Plus, as Tony mentioned, Best Buy's will probably have their own Rock Band setup close to launch time, so they'll be plenty of chances to play the game with a crowd nearby and not having to purchase the game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Treasure remaking itself" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/treasure-remaking-itself">Treasure remaking itself</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This third remake will be of <b>Bangai-O</b> originally released on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast.</p><div class='title'><b>Guardian Heroes</b></div><p>3 years ago, Treasure remade their classic Guardian Heroes on the Gameboy Advance.  Guardian Heroes was originally released on the Sega Saturn back in 1996.</p><p>Guardian Heroes is considered the benchmark for the beat-em-up genre, featuring a pure blend of leveling, brawling, and balance between all playable characters, much like Golden Axe and Gauntlet.  Something that Guardian Heroes really expanding on move-sets, so it had all the moves of a fighter, but was a 5 or 6 player co-op brawler.</p><p>There really hasn't been any game since then to top the this wonderfully designed arcade style classic.</p><p>In 2004, <b>Advance Guardian Heroes</b> was released with very disappointing results.  I've never played it, nor owned it, but I have seen it around for pretty cheap, so perhaps I'll pick it up at some point.</p><p>The US version of Guardian Heroes fetches a pretty hefty price on ebay these days.  Luckily, I was able to snag a Japanese copy for about $26 while studying abroad. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Gunstar Heroes</b></div><p>Right after Advance Guardian Heroes, Treasure set forth to remake another one of their classics, Gunstar Heroes.  Gunstar Heroes was actually Treasure's first game, right after Masato Maegawa and a bunch of his friends split from Konami.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes is a character shmup.  You play Blue or Red as you blast away hordes upon hordes of enemies that never stop coming.  You just keep killing and killing and killing.  It's great fun ^_^ and is considered one of the best shmups of the sub-genre.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes was made for the Sega Genesis and made full use of the hardware.  It was released along side Sega hardcore Arcade lineup and found an excellent home.</p><p>In Oct of 2005, Treasure released <b>Gunstar Super Heroes</b> for the Gameboy Advance.  This release also saw a disappointed release as the public really had no idea what Gunstar Heroes was.</p><p>Despite the poor sales, It's really an amazing game.  It's Treasure's love letter to Sega fans, using several themes of the Arcade Genesis it was originally released with, like After Burner and a couple other ones I don't quite remember.</p><p>Gunstar Super Heroes is damn awesome, so you should pick up a copy at your local Toys R Us for about $15.  Also, Gunstar Heroes is available of Wii Virtual Console for $8, which is also a damn good buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Bangai-O</b></div><p>So, that brings us to today.  By the end of the year, Treasure will release it's third remake on the DS, entitled <b>Bangai-O Spirits</b>.</p><p>Bangai-O is in a weird genre.  It's a free-roaming shmup, where you explore around the level and reach the boss at the end.  I guess, technically, it would be a side-scrolling shmup, except you fly in all directions whenever you want.  The point of Bangai-O is to make massive explosions with bombs laying around the stage and destroy as much as possible with various chains of explosions.</p><p>It was originally released for the Nintendo 64, but found a home on the Dreamcast as well..  that's the only version that was released in the states.</p><p>ugh..  I'm god awful at this game.  I really couldn't figure out how to play it, and I ended up just getting really frustrated with it..  Some people consider it to be one of Treasure's best games, but I don't really see it.</p><p><em>New Features</em>:  Unlike previous remakes, this Bangai-O Spirits looks like it adds a ton of stuff.  Multiplayer (both Co-op and versus), Map Editor, Full map on the top screen..  this actually sounds pretty badass.</p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>This all comes rather timely, as Microsoft, at their pre-TGS conference, finally officially announced that <b>Ikaruga</b> will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade next year.  Ikaruga is my favorite Treasure title, and I also deem it as Treasure's best game.. hands down.</p><p><a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html" title="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html">http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html</a></p><p>Ikaruga is a beautiful horizontal-scrolling shmup featuring the Zen of fighting light v. dark.  Enemies are of both light and dark, and you are able to combat and absorb their powers by flipping your side, back and forth, between light and dark.</p><p>Stunning game.</p><p><em>Also</em>, along side Ikaruga, <b>Rez</b>, <b>Every Extend Extra</b>, and <b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b> will also be making their way on XBLA.  Nice!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3: Biting the Bullet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-biting-the-bullet">Halo 3: Biting the Bullet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 11, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Ever since the beginning, I've been pretty against the Xbox.  I will never own an original Xbox, mainly because all my good Xbox games are now backwards compatible, the controller is rather horrid, and the overall bias the Japanese games are far superior to American games.. definitely on consoles.</p><p>But the 360 has changed a lot of things.  It's a very robust machine that IS changing gaming, and some good games are actually beginning to appear on the console.</p><p>I've been absolutely blown away by Mass Effect, but one cannot ignore Halo 3.</p><div class='title'><b>Rationale</b></div><p>I have decided to buy Halo 3 on launch day, but main rationale behind owning/playing it, is to re-live an old past-time that Justin (my army pal) and I shared nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Back in the day, Justin and I played the living crap out of Goldeneye.  In the morning, we'd have school, and in the evening we'd meet up at our jobs at Toys R Us.  I ran the video game section there, and the manager's usually made him do crap work.</p><p>As the store came to a close, and I hid the last of my re-shop, He and I would get back to his place around 10:30pm, and end up playing versus Goldeneye until 1 or 2am on a school night.  We'd do this damn near every night, and occasionally drag other co-workers along for the ride.</p><p>Our video game days were pretty much over when he decided to join the military..</p><p>Several months ago, he picked up a 360 and have found a new love in video gaming.  He's played the crap out of most of the major releases such as Rainbox 6 Vegas, Ghost Recon, and Bioshock.  He is eagerly anticipating the release of Halo 3, so he pushes it onto me.</p><p>At this point, I was teetoring either way, but what really clenched it for me were these Best Buy midnight parties, with free stuff.  Video game events are badass, so why the hell not.  The rationale outweighs the irrationale.</p><div class='title'><b>Decisions</b></div><p>So, I'm gonna preorder Halo 3, BUT which copy do I buy?  I've got 3 to choose from.  Legendary Edition comes with 4 discs, a bunch of artbooks and a Spartan helmet all for $130...  Absolutely not.  So, really I have 2 choices: Regular Edition or Limited Edition.</p><p>Well, this is a tough decision for me.  I will always think twice, thrice, etc on whether or not to get the slightly more expensive Limited Edition versus the a stale 'ol Regular Edition.  It's collector nature for me.</p><p>My main distinction is that this is Halo.  It has already sold more than one million copies prior to its actual release.  It is going to be the most common, most played Xbox game ever.  This game will basically be worthless several weeks after release.  It's "collector" value with plomit faster than a fat guy into a buffet.</p><p>In a long enough span of time, the Limited Edition will retain more than a $10 lead on the Regular Edition.  The Regular Edition will probably be $20 around this time next year, whereas the Limited Edition will never be printed again.</p><p>BUT, is that really true?  I can still find copies of Halo 2 Limited Edition in used game stores for around $20, whereas the normal edition is $14.  The Limited Edition MAY be limited, but there are still around 500,000 copies of it floating around.  It's no where near rare.</p><p>Obviously, the collector's argument is not valid at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Value</b></div><p>Let's look at this argument from a different perspective.  Regular Edition is $60, and Limited Edition is $70.  You get raped by the inane price no matter which way you face..  So what's the difference between the 2 versions.</p><p>Regular Edition nets you Halo 3.  Limited Edition nets you Halo 3, hardcover Halo 3 artbook, Halo 3 fiction book, extra disc with "making of" features and HD calibration details, and a hardcover case that'll fit everything inside of it.  You get a ton of stuff for that extra $10.  Almost enough stuff to forget you're paying so much for the most common game you'll ever find in a year.</p><p>That's in a year though, and I've got two choices.. so the decision has been made on the Value argument.</p><div class='title'><b>Ironic</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" /></p><p>So yeah, today I picked up the preorder for Halo 3 Limited Edition at my local Best Buy, which will be having its midnight release party in 13 days.</p><p>I find it rather ironic that Halo 3 will be the first Xbox 360 or Xbox game that I'll be purchasing at full price..  Mass Effect will no longer have that honor.  Unless you count those Burger King games, which were bought at the full price of $4 each..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phoenix Wright: Release History" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phoenix-wright-release-history">Phoenix Wright: Release History</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After the completion of Metroid Prime 3, I've been really getting into Phoenix Wright 3.  I usually play about an hour or two every night, and currently I'm on the second investigation part on the third (out of four) cases.  It's kinda fun, but it certainly does not have the intensity of innovation I experience when I played the first Phoenix Wright.</p><div class='title'><b>Release History</b></div><p>Let's explore the releases of Phoenix Wright to further understand the lineage of the series.</p><p>Phoenix Wright was first released for the Nintendo DS, here in the US on October 12th, 2005; however, the DS versions of Phoenix Wright, or Gyakuten Saiban are actually remakes of the Gameboy Advance games.  Gyakuten Saiban 1 was first released 4 years prior on the same date for the GBA.</p><p><pre>10/12/01 - Gyakuten Saiban - 58,877 units sold</pre></p><p>It's release did not do so well, but that didn't stop Capcom from making a sequel.  Just one year later, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was released.  Of course, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was the exact same game, but with different music, different stories, and some new characters ^_^.  Capcom re-released the first title on the same day at a budget price to increase sales for the series overall.</p><p><pre>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 129,630 units sold<br/>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 - 176,953 units sold</pre></p><p>Which, worked fairly damn well.  All those that missed Phoenix Wright the first time around, easily picked up both titles now that the first one was a mere $30.  Capcom LOVES to make billions of sequels, so it comes to no surprise that they did the exact same thing the year after.</p><p><pre>12/19/03 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 101,388 units sold<br/>01/23/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 - 173,336 units sold</pre></p><p>Actually, after playing PW3, it's rather hard to picture it selling 173k units.  The IP seemed pretty strong.  Sure it wasn't moving a million units, but nearly 200k units is pretty good for Japan sales.</p><p>I'm not really sure what happened at this point..  But Gyakuten Saiban 4 did not follow the next year.  Perhaps something happens at the end of the third game that simply can't allow for a 4th game with Phoenix Wright..  As October came up, they released PW3 at a budget price.</p><p><pre>10/01/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 68,181 units sold</pre></p><p>But, with no new game to push sales of the old game..  it did nearly as well as the series debut.  Fall of 2004 saw a shift in Handheld gaming though..  This was the time where the Nintendo DS was released.  Capcom decided to hop on the DS craze by porting over their slight successful game series.</p><p><pre>09/15/05 - Gyakuten Saiban - 128,842 units sold<br/>10/12/05 - Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - ~100,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The 5th year of Gyakuten Saiban, brought forth the DS version of the game with slightly better graphics and a NEW DS only case after you beat the game.  Original fans of the series flocked to the new level, whereas new adopters of the series fell in love with Phoenix Wright for the first time.</p><p>Over here in the US, the game sold poorly thanks to poor marketing and very few units shipped.  It wasn't until Spring of 2006 rolled around and people had huge difficulty finding the game, that Capcom realized it was their fault for the poor sales.  They re-release the US version a couple times, while over in Japan, they released the game at a budget to pull more people into the series.</p><p><pre>06/15/06 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 149,552 unit sold</pre></p><p>Now, I don't know if the original DS release had this, but this budget release just so happened to include the full English version of the game.  Gamers in the US helped add to these sales since they could not find a US copy.  Sales were also very high due to the release of the DS Lite which happened 2 months prior.</p><p>A couple months later saw the revamp and release of the Second title.</p><p><pre>10/26/06 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 111,485 units sold<br/>01/16/07 - Phoenix Wright 2: Justice for All - 90,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The Japanese release started right off as a budget title, which makes complete sense as it lacked a DS only chapter.  The Japanese release also contained the full English version of the game, which can account for lack-luster US sales.  Die-hard US Phoenix Wright fans simply imported the game to play it months ahead of time.</p><p>Along with the Japanese release, began the promotional support for the long-awaited release of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  A new original game for the series that contained all new characters, and all chapters which used all capabilities of the DS, and in April of 2007..  fans finally got their game.</p><p><pre>04/12/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 4 - 487,000 units sold</pre></p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was hands-down, the fastest selling title of the series.  In fact, in its first week it sold more copies than any single version of a previous game.  Thanks to all these crazy previous releases, fans knew what was coming for the series.  DS chapters much like that extra chapter in the first game.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was such a success, that a few weeks later, Capcom simply blurting out that Gyakuten Saiban 5 would happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, for US fans of the series, Gyakuten Saiban 4 does not contain the English version, so we must wait for the US release, or perhaps it'll be included on its' budget release.</p><p>Anyways, just 2 weeks away, Capcom finally released Gyakuten Saiban 3, and fans of the series who missed it the first time, can finally see how Phoenix Wright's saga ends.</p><p><pre>08/23/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 77,000 (so far)</pre></p><p>Not too far off, Phoenix Wright 3 will be hitting the states.</p><p><pre>10/23/07 - Phoenix Wright 3: Trials and Tribulations</pre></p><p>Capcom is currently holding the 3rd game over the heads of us US fans of the series..  "If you want Phoenix Wright 4, you'll have to buy Phoenix Wright 3.  If sales are good, it's a go!"  Though, they are already planning on bringing it over as <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</em>.</p><p>Honestly, I cannot wait for Apollo Justice..  So much so, that i'll actually play through Phoenix Wright 3 ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Total Sales</b></div><p>So, let's tabulate all the current sales and see how the individual games actually stack up against each other.</p><p><pre>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (5 versions) - ~566,901 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Justice for All (4 versions) - ~479,826 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations (3 versions) - 318,517 japan only, so far<br/>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney (1 version) - 487,000 japan only</pre></p><p>I'd imagine sales for Apollo Justice eventually overtaking the original game, no problem.</p><p><b><i>Update:</i></b> By the way, I should really mention that I acquired this data from Cubed3 who found it from the Neo-GAF post I originally saw it in, which happens to be 4 months out of date, and also from vgchartz.com which is almost never accurate.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Prime 3 Full Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-prime-3-full-impressions">Metroid Prime 3 Full Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 2, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Getting into Metroid Prime 3 was very easy for me.  I've been waiting for a game on the Wii that I could tear apart and dive into without hestitation.  Metroid is that game.</p><p>It's very odd though.. What do I like about Metroid Prime 3?  My overall feelings towards the game are very numb and complacent.  There are so many mediocre points in the game, but are easily looking over while playing the game.</p><div class='title'><b><em>By the way..  this review will continue mountains of spoilers, so please don't read on if you don't wish to be spoiled</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Playing the game..</b></div><p>Playing this game is a dream.  I absolutely love the gameplay.  Honestly, I can see why people are so ape shit about the gameplay and say stupid things like, "This is the best console fps experience you'll ever have."  That's a bold statement, but I think I would agree that the controls are spot on.  Overall, I do prefer this over dual analog sticks.  You get FAR more control and precision shooting things with the Wii-mote.  A little joystick cannot compare to the Wii-mote at all.</p><p>This is how you make a Wii game.  This is how you make full use of the Wii-mote and motion controls with over burdening your gamer.  The little subtle actions of showing off the motion controls are great because they only happen when you're completely focused are flipping a switch, turning screw controls, or pulling out energy containers.</p><div class='title'><b>Reviewing this game..</b></div><p>It's because of this beautiful gameplay that everyone loves the game.  It's the same reason I love it.  So many publications give this game a 10 or a 9.5 simply because of this, but I don't know why they didn't grade the game harsher on its fall backs.  The gameplay is like that genius student in your class that makes up for all the others students getting Cs.  The gameplay is that one cop that goes out on a limb to solve the case in the most elaborate and thorough way (like John Mcclain), while everything else in the game simply plays it straight and safe.</p><p>There's so much mediocrity in this game that is overshadowed by the gameplay that just isn't getting press, but with good reason.  In good conscience can reviewers really just gloss over everything else because it is blantly bad and give it a perfect 10 based on gameplay alone?</p><p>It's weird..  I'm not dissapointed with the game, and I think they did a fantastic job with it too.  Here..  I'll just tell you what I think about it..</p><div class='title'><b>The Music..</b></div><p>The music in Metroid Prime 3 is absolutely bland.  They overuse that organic flange like it was pop rocks in the 80s.  The music is so uninspired, so subtle...  but it doesn't get in your way.  The music doesn't push the environment on you; it's just there to create an ambiance, but doesn't fit with the environment at all.  It reminds me of Doom for some reason, but far more low key.</p><p>The background music does feel very Metroid, but it doesn't feel alien at all.  More mission driven and pumping.</p><p>However, this is completely overruled by One track in the game that had me blown away.  Put me in a state of awe.  That one track I was waiting for the entire game to blow me away.  The Ice level has absolutely beautiful background music.  Fluttering high-note piano music raining snow onto the land, the fields, the statues, and me in the middle of it.</p><p>This was the first point in teh game that I actually stopped for a moment and took it in.  Listened to the beautiful orchestrated notes take me to this place, much like it did back in Metroid Prime 1 with Phendrana..  the Ice planet.  That's kinda weird isn't it?  How can the best two tracks in the Metroid Prime series both be from Ice worlds.  They should make christmas music or something..  Metroid Prime 4: Lost in the Ice Kingdom would probably be the best videogame OST in the history of gaming.</p><p>But that's it.  I went through the Ice world, collected the Screw Attack, and left..  That was it for the entire fricken game..  The only other track that comes close is the menu music..  That's somewhat decent.</p><p>It's rather funny that the quality of Music forms and equal parallel to game overall.  There's one piece of music that keeps you from counting out the music all together.</p><div class='title'><b>The Environments..</b></div><p>This is the first Metroid where you aren't on One planet the whole game.  Overall, you have 5 major planets and a few other places consisting of at least a dozen unique areas of exploration.  Actually, the more I think about it, the diversity within a planet really tells the story of civilization on that planet.  The 5 planets you explore are Norion, Bryyo, Elysia, Pirate Homeworld and Phaze, though I suppose Phaze really doesn't count.</p><p>The environments you encounter through the game are pretty standard.  You walk around on a battle cruiser like in a Halo 2, go through a federation outpost which is pretty standard.  Metroid begins very federation oriented which is unlike any other Metroid and everything like most space opera sci-fi.  Once you finally break free of the federation and begin exploring, you start to encounter actual alien worlds.</p><p>The first alien world is Bryyo and is also the most under developed of the planets.  It's quite interesting that because it's the most under developed, it is also the most varied in enviroments.  You do come across a pirate outpost, but it is thick within the jungle.  On the side of the planet, you have the firey volcanos.  Within the fire pits, you come across a warp point to the Ice caverns.  On this one planet, you have complete polar opposites, somewhat like Earth.</p><p>Because of the varied environments you have all kinds of plant, animal and sentient life, which doesn't make sense why it's the most boring planet of them all.  Hurray i'm in a Jungle.. Hurrah I'm in a volcano.  Hurrah i'm in an ice cavern (but the music is beautiful).  Don't get me wrong, they all look quite good, but don't go that extra mile to really WOW me.  All these environments have already been done in Metroid Prime 1.</p><p>Elysia.  Now HERE is a planet that made me stop and just look around at everything.  Elysia is a lot like Jupiter, a gasious liquid planet that nothing can live on, unless you were in the upper atmosphere away from the violent death storms.  You walk around on a settlement built in the sky which is completely built on <em>Steam</em>.  Oh baby..   A Steampunk planet..  fucking brilliant.</p><p>All the little robots are steam powered.  When you walk around, they are little repair bots working on the station to keep it running and working.  The enemy robots are straight out of 50s scifi.  A very hostile andriod looking robot firing ring beams at you.  I love Elysia, but what really annoyed me was everywhere you went was the same.  You didn't have a multiple varied environments like you did back on Bryyo.</p><p>After Elysia, you go to the Pirate Homeworld was is more standard technology type stuff.  It kinda reminds me of the Borg homeworld and to finish off the game you go to planet Phaze which is beautiful, but pretty standard stuff at this point after going into the Leviathan ships.</p><p>One other spiffy place you can go is optional and it is the remenants of a battle between Federation and Pirates which was over-swarmed by Metroids.  This is my absolute favorite point in the game because you are investigating what actually happened to this federation ship and uncovering clues to the actual menance that awaits you at the end of the game.</p><p>Because this area is optional, you need to find Energy Cells throughout the game to repower doors, ramps and elevators in this deserted graveyard.  There needed to be MUCH MUCH more of this, rather than just chasing around pirates.  Focus the game on METROIDS, not the stupid pirate conspiracies involving metroids.  Use your graphically power to show off how deadly the metroid race is, rather than some submissive controlled species.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroids..</b></div><p>Hey guess what.. let's talk about how under utilized Metroids are in Metroid Prime 3.  How do you kill a Metroid?  This is video game survival 101.  You freeze it, and fire 5 missiles at it which will shatter the monster.  That's pretty much what you do in Metroid Prime 3, however you also kill a Metroid through hypermode or a sniped headshot, which makes it way to easy.</p><p>The whole point of fighting a Metroid is to feel like you are David versus Goliath.  Metroids are ruthless, energy sucking parasites which will devour every ounce of strength you have.  Metroid Prime 3 portreys the Metroid species just as any other creatures in the game.  Just another enemy in your way.  In fact, there are more menancing creatures in the game than Metroids.</p><p>The only scene that came close to showing off Metroid brutality was one Metroid dragging a federation soldiers corpse through a hallway.</p><p>There needs to be a scene, NOT a cutscene, where a bunch of Metroids break free and run rampant through a planet, chewing on the nearby animals, all while you are fending them off and trying to get away before falling victim.  Metroids are basically higher level alien zombies..  Why not feed on the anxiety and suspense of a zombie attack in a Metroid game?</p><p>You'd be fucked if you came up against 3 Metroids.. but not in Metroid Prime 3.  blam blam.. they're dead, you're safe.  bullshit.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story..</b></div><p>Besides that, the story is still rather lacking.  You basically go through space, fighting off pirate advances and learn of the growing menance of Phazon.  All while, the phazon inside of you is growing and slowly taking over.</p><p>Being slowly corrupted is a great plot device, but means nothing when your character doesn't talk or give any emotional indication of being corrupted.  Samus is basically a robot inside of her armor suit.  This is one of things I noticed right away after killing one of her friends in the beginning.  She is emotionally disconnected with the story, which makes it really hard to play a character driven game.</p><p>HOWEVER..  This special ending finally brings emotion into Samus..  It's really a shame that you have to get 75% complete in order to view this ending, because this IS the emotion missing from the game.  Samus lands on Elysia, takes off her helmet and looks into the clouds.  She stares saddenly into the distance and thinks about her friends, their corruption into madness, and her duty to put them down..  It's very powerful, though has crappy music that could have made it more powerful.</p><p>The super special ending after getting 100% complete continues from there.  She walks back to her ship, takes off the rest of her suit, and then goes into space.  After flying into the distance, another ship rises from the surface as well, and follows her.  OMG sequel!</p><div class='title'><b>blah blah blah..</b></div><p>To sum it up, Metroid Prime 3 is pretty slick.  It is a great example of how game developers need to utilize the Wii-mote's abilities to the fullest.  Definitely play this game.  <em>This is the best game on the Wii right now.</em></p><p>As you can see from all the text above, I don't really feel overly amazed by the game, but it definitely doesn't suck.  There's a ton of potential that didn't follow through, but it is a joy to play and is very solid too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-prime-3-first-impressions">Metroid Prime 3 First Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 28, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, the Wii finally got its first big release that wasn't a ported game from another console..  Metroid Prime 3 is out in stores, though you might have some difficultly locating it.  I traded in Big Brain Academy and Rayman Raving Rabbits to Gamestop for a full-price reserve a month or two ago, so i was set.  Also, when I went to pick it up today, I put in a reserve for Mass Effect. ^_^</p><p>I could hardly wait to play this game today.  Don't get me wrong, learning about concurrency and thread-safety, while implementing processes for work is rather interesting..  but it can't really compare against shooting things with the Wii-mote..  or can it?</p><div class='title'><b>Let's begin...</b></div><p>As you wake up from Cryostasis, you are inside your spaceship.  You can look around, push buttons, but eventually have to open communications with the Starfleet, rendezvous with them, and speak with the admiral.  It's a very non-game moment where you're in character, much like the beginning of Half-life or Halo.  Once aboard the ship, you can walk around and talk with people.  Of course, you don't talk back..  you're a Nintendo Character, after all.</p><p>The gameplay is pretty fluid, but does take a little getting used to.  The biggest hurdle I've been trying to get over is that the Z button holds your view, rather than the B button, as it is in Resident Evil 4.  The B Button in Metroid is jump.  So when ever I try to fire at something, I end up jumping around first before actually locking on to them.  :slaps forehead:</p><p>As soon as I began walking around, Tony said that everyone online recommends switching your look to "advanced" rather than the defaulted "normal".  Thank you Tony/Internet.  Normal and Advanced are basically degrees of when your view will move with where you point the cursor.  In Normal you have to point near the edge of the screen before your viewpoint actually turns in that direction.  With Advanced, your viewpoint will always turn when the cursor isn't in the middle of the screen.  It will turn to the degree with respect to how far away your cursor is from the middle.  It feels much more natural.</p><p>There's also other neat little Wii-mote movements, like turning key-locks, pumping other locks, and swinging the nunchuck around to use the grapple-beam..  Everything is quite intuitive ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Getting into it..</b></div><p>There really hasn't been much of a story yet..  Space Pirates attack, you repel them..  You get infected by Plasma or whatever it's called..  You investigate other stuff..</p><p>The story telling style is rather awkwardly paced.  In some cases, you have full dialogue of your mission objectives and what is actually happening around you.  But in other instances, when you're on the planet fighting, the gameplay is directing the story..</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b>: At the beginning you have a bunch of your Bounty Hunter buddies, that help you fight off the space pirates.  Later, after you've all been infected, you search a planet where one of them had been last seen.  You end up fighting one of your pals after he's been completely corrupted, but NOT once do you ever show remorse for his situation, nor when you kill him.. </em></p><p><em>Metroid Prime 3 feels very disconnected emotionally because of this..  If Samus doesn't care about killing one of her friends, how am I supposed to feel any compassion towards her.  I don't see this motif changing..</em></p><div class='title'><b>Achievements..</b></div><p>Something pretty slick Metroid has adopted, is the notion of achievements..  and they take many different forms.  You get a little achievement when you scan a monster (red coins), when you scan some lore (blue coins), when you defeat a boss (yellow coins), and other little random ones (tags).  There's also green coins, which I haven't figured out how to get.</p><p>All the coins you acquire can be traded in for unlockables: Concept Art, Background music, and, my favorite, stuff for your car (spaceship).  You can get bumperstickers for your spaceship.  You can get Bobblehead figurines for your dashboards.  All kinds of stupid crap.  Most of them require green coins, though :/</p><p>The tags, on the other hand, work with your friends list.  I've gotten tags for killing 100 enemies, killing 200 enemies, and 2 other things which I can't recall.  You can use these tags to send a friend voucher to someone on your list.  I sent one to Erika and Dave..  What do they do?!</p><div class='title'><b>The Atmosphere..</b></div><p>One of the things I did love in Metroid Prime 1, was the music..  ESPECIALLY Phendrana, the Ice level.  The music was absolutely ambient, subtle, and atmospheric.  I just wanted to sit back and take it in..  So far, Metroid Prime 3's music has been sub-par to ass.  Honestly, it's so un-memorable, I can't even remember what it sounds like when I try to recall it.</p><p>Music in a game is pretty important for me..  It'll make a mediocre game memorable, and a fantastic game boring, for me.  All of my all-time favorite games have very much to do with having an excellent soundtrack.  So when a game is somewhat boring enough for me to notice that the music is pretty stupid, there's a problem.</p><p>I'm pretty disappointed by this, but there is FAR more game left to surprise.</p><div class='title'><b>Where I'm at..</b></div><p>After I finally exited out of Metroid Prime 3, my time was 4 hours.  I'm at 12% complete of the game, too.  I'm guessing I'll probably finish the game around 20 or 25 hours.  Remember, the percentage is the total amount of stuff done in the game, not your progression through the story.</p><p>Despite being disappointed by a couple things, I am having fun with it..  I can't wait to see what happens when we start getting into rogue Aurora Units and Metroid conspiracies..  I'll definitely be disappointed if neither of those two things happen.</p><p>Right now, there seems to be a lot going on..  So that's good ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to When does stuff come out?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/when-does-stuff-come-out">When does stuff come out?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Last week saw the release of AAA title Bioshock, and this week, we have Metroid Prime on the Wii.  We've got a month until Halo 3, but it seems like nothing is really coming out in October.  Then on Nov 12th, everything is coming out at once.</p><p>What does this Christmas' release schedule actually look like?  Well let's see here...</p><p>Aug 28th - Wii - <b>Metroid Prime 3</b><br/>Aug 28th - 360 - Blue Dragon<br/>Aug 29th - XBLA - Puzzle Fighter II HD Remix<br/>Aug 30th - PSN - Puzzle Fighter II HD Remix</p><p>Sept 4th - PS3 - Lair<br/>Sept 5th - 360 - Stranglehold<br/>Sept 13th - PSP - <b>Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core (import)</b><br/>Sept 14th - PS3 - Stranglehold<br/>Sept 20th - PSP - R-Type Tactics (import)<br/>Sept 25th - 360 - <b>Halo 3</b><br/>Sept 25th - Wii - DDR Wii Edition<br/>Sept 25th - Wii - Dewey's Adventure<br/>Sept 25th - PS2 - <b>DDR Supernova 2</b></p><p>Oct 2nd - PC - Quake Wars<br/>Oct 9th - DS - Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass<br/>Oct 9th - PC - Half-life 2: The Orange Box<br/>Oct 9th - PSP - <b>Final Fantasy Tactics</b><br/>Oct 15th - 360 - Beautiful Katamari<br/>Oct 16th - PS2 - <b>Daisenryaku 7 Exceed</b><br/>Oct 18th - PS2 - Seaman 2 (import)<br/>Oct 23rd - PSP - <b>Castlevania: the Dracula Chronicles</b><br/>Oct 23rd - PS3 - Eye of Judgement<br/>Oct 23rd - Wii - Table Tennis<br/>Oct 23rd - DS - Phoenix Wright III<br/>Oct 28th - 360 - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 28th - PS3 - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 28th - Wii - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 29th - PS2 - Guitar Hero III<br/>Oct 29th - PS2 - Aqua Teen Hunger Force game<br/>Oct 29th - Wii - Endless Ocean (aka Forever Blue)<br/>Oct 30th - DS - Jam Sessions<br/>Oct 30th - PSP - Disgaea</p><p>Nov 5th - 360 - Call of Duty 4<br/>Nov 5th - PS3 - Call of Duty 4<br/>Nov 5th - Wii - Fire Emblem<br/>Nov 6th - PSP - <b>Silent Hill Origins</b><br/>Nov 6th - PS2 - DDR Disney Channel<br/>Nov 6th - Wii - Ghost Squad<br/>Nov 12th - PS3 - Unreal Tournament 3<br/>Nov 12th - Wii - <b>Super Mario Galaxy</b><br/>Nov 13th - 360 - <b>Mass Effect</b><br/>Nov 13th - Wii - NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams<br/>Nov 13th - Wii - Rayman Raving Rabbids 2<br/>Nov 13th - Wii - <b>Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles</b><br/>Nov 13th - Wii - Soul Calibur Legends<br/>Nov 13th - Wii - <b>Trauma Center: New Blood</b><br/>Nov 13th - Wii - Geometry Wars Galaxies<br/>Nov 13th - DS - Geometry Wars Galaxies<br/>Nov 13th - PSP - <b>Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Plus</b><br/>Nov 19th - PS3 - Haze<br/>Nov 19th - DS - Mario Party DS<br/>Nov 20th - DS - Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings<br/>Nov 20th - 360 - Rock Band<br/>Nov 20th - PS3 - Rock Band</p><p>Dec 3rd - Wii - Smash Brothers Brawl</p><p>(This is according to gamefaqs, gamespot, and other random sources, but cheifly gamefaqs)</p><p>Well actually, it looks like plenty of games are coming out in October.  Starting off with Orange Box and Final Fantasy Tactics and continuing on with Castlevania PSP.  There's also Guitar Hero III at the end of the month.</p><p>But Jesus..  A fair amount of note-worthy titles are actually coming out on November 13th.  Especially for the Wii..  Why the hell would any publisher on the Wii decide to release the same week as Super Mario Galaxy.  What brainiacs thought that one up?  I'll be buying Mass Effect that week, and also MGS:PO+ since it's $20 on amazon, but christ.  Under any other circumstances I probably would have picked up Resident Evil Umbrella Chronicles and Trauma Center 2.  Probably NiGHTS as well.  Way to go, dipshits.</p><p>There are a couple other uncommon games coming out that will surely be looked over.  Like DDR Supernova 2, Daisenryaku 7 Exceed, R-Type Tactics and Seaman 2.  R-Type Tactics will probably get localized, so I could wait on that one..  if not, I'm sure it'll be easy to find in Japan when I visit there next.  There's a new DDR Disney Mix coming out too..</p><p>After looking over this list.. I think I've got my games picked out:</p><p>Aug 28th - Wii - <b>Metroid Prime 3</b><br/>Sept 25th - Ps2 - DDR Supernova 2<br/>Oct 9th - DS - <b>Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass</b><br/>Oct 16th - Ps2 - Daisenryaku 7 Exceed<br/>Oct 23rd - PSP - <b>Castlevania Dracula Chronicles</b><br/>Nov 13th - 360 - <b>Mass Effect</b><br/>Nov 13th - PSP - Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops</p><p>Though, somewhere in there, I might also pick up Endless Ocean, Final Fantasy Tactics and Silent Hill Origins.. Also, I'm pretty sure Daisenryaku will get pushed back or canceled since it's a shmup and people don't care about shmups.</p><p>___</p><p>In other news, I got Phoenix Wright 3 in the mail today ^_^.</p><p>I played through the first chapter, and so far, it's just more of the same.  Exactly same gameplay as the 2nd game, with new music that doesn't stand up to the 1st one.  This is pretty much what I expected though after playing through Phoenix Wright 2..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Headed Home" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/headed-home">Headed Home</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>All good things must come to an end, and I'm on the plane back to Madison.  I probably should have used another vacation day and stayed for the entirety of the Con, but I had pretty much done everything that PAX had to offer in these two days.  I think Ace & Jess are bringing Dan & Becky around to the Microsoft and Nintendo campuses, and then later to the "Mitsuwa" of Seattle..  but those things will always be there. ^_^  I can check 'em out next time.</p><p>For the plane rides I had picked up a couple games to keep me busy..  I wrote a long boring text file of getting these games.. but i think it's almost too boring to post..</p><p>I had Planet Puzzle League, which I purchased the weekend before up in Minneapolis..  And picked up Brain Age 2 and Rune Factory specifically for the trip.</p><div class='title'><b>Rune Factory</b></div><p>Rune Factory is a fantasy based harvest moon which features many RPG aspects into the genre.  I've been quite excited about this game..  In fact, I nearly imported it over a year ago, anticipating its release.  I was very happy to see it come to the states.</p><p>In Rune Factory, you are a wandering traveler with amnesia who stumbles upon a girl that needs someone to work on her farm.  You accept and begin working on the farm..  You eventually get a hoe and all the tools you need, and begin like any other harvest moon.</p><p>The twist is that there are several caves throughout the land which harbor monsters.  You can go down in these caves and kill monsters or you can "friend" them and have them work on your farm for you.</p><p>This game has an amazing amount of customability and open-ended-ness...  but it's boring as fuck.  most Harvest Moon games are..  Much like I mentioned in the last post, there are so many games out and coming out that who's going to spend 50 to 60 hours playing through Rune Factory when there are better options.</p><p>Also, it's not really all that good.  It takes a tremendous amount of patience with very little rewards..  But this is only my initial impression.  I played it for about 2 or 3 hours before not wanting to play it ever again..  I'm really not in the mood for this game and I don't know if I'll ever be.</p><p>I wouldn't really recommend this game..  But If you really really like harvest moon, I'm sure you'll like this game too.</p><div class='title'><b>Planet Puzzle League</b></div><p>God, I'm horrible at this game..  I've never been good at this game, and don't know why I never thought of that when buying it.  I much prefer Tetris and Dr. Mario to Puzzle League or Panel de Pon..</p><p>The puzzle modes are pretty fun, but I can't get anywhere in single player mode.</p><div class='title'><b>Brain Age 2</b></div><p>I'm a pretty big fan of Brain Age 1. I kept up with it for nearly 2 months..  I played it each and everyday, tracked my Brain Age, and got a daily stamp which eventually unlocked more things to do.  I've also got around 80% completion in the Sudoku category.  It was a no-brainer that I'd pick up the sequel.</p><p>There were a few problems with Brain Age 1.  Namely the fact that it didn't recognize when you said BLUE, but it was too damn easy.  I kept a very long streak of having a Brain Age of 20, the lowest possible.  My Brain Age chart is a flat line at the 20 mark.</p><p>Brain Age 2 features all new puzzles which are more challenging and grading is more harsh.  I started off with a Brain Age of 34, and even though I've tried my hardest over the weekend, I've only today managed to get past the 30 year old mark.  I love it.  It actually gives a me a challenge to overcome, rather than constantly get the highest possible score.</p><p>Sudoku in Brain Age 2 also raises the bar in difficultly.  I'm fairly decent at Sudoku and these "basic" puzzles take me about 20 to 30 minutes to complete.  That's about how long it takes me to complete an Expert level puzzle on the previous game.  At first, I was disappointed that both Brain Ages have only 100 Sudoku puzzles, but it's a good amount.  It'll still take you a decent amount of time to complete 'em.</p><p>With Brain Age 2 raising the bar on these games, it really disappointed me that Vision Training was so easy.</p><p>If like to be challenged by word and math puzzles, definitely pick up Brain Age 2.  It's only $20 ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>A few hours later..</b></div><p>Greetings from Detriot..  Both plane trips back and forth from Seattle have really taught me the importance of buying tickets WELL ahead of time, rather than a mere 4 weeks.  Sitting bitch for 4 hours in a seat that is narrowly widen than your body is the most uncomfortable 4 hours I've ever experienced..  aside from sitting bitch in the same fashion for 13 hours back from Japan..</p><p>Also, I wish American Airline tickets were cheaper than Northwest Airlines, because every single NWA flight I've been on contained loudmouth, inconsiderate douche bags, crying children who kick your seat, and that one passenger who makes a big scene on how they're being mistreated.  It never fails..  I don't get it.</p><p>I don't get how people can be so oblivious, inconsiderate, selfish and rude to complete strangers..  We're all on this flight together..  obviously you're complaining about how you're being treated, why the crap can't you realize you're doing the same to everyone else..  jesus.</p><p>Honestly, NWA is not bad at all..  I don't know why people all the passengers seems to think otherwise.  I seriously mean it this time..  I'm spending the extra $100 to fly something else, if the option exists.</p><p>ugh.. now I'm just blathering on about pointless topics..</p><p><b>edit/update</b>.. actually my flight from Detroit to Madison was absolutely perfect.  The plane was only filled around 40% and everyone had a great time.  It really made me forget about the flights from one big city to another.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/21">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/19">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
