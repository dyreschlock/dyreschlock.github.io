| December 21, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After taking a break for a few weeks, I completed Pokemon Omega Ruby today.  There's still the Delta Episode to complete, plus several legendaries to scoop up, though.</p><p>Omega Ruby is pretty damn good.  They've cleaned up a lot of rough edges from Pokemon X, and there's a ton of end game, and side content.  WAY more than Pokemon X/Y.  I think the only shame is not continuing the character customization from Pokemon X, but that's fine.</p><p>Right now, my Pokedex for Pokemon X is at 718*, and Omega Ruby is at 716 out of a (current) possible 719.  I need an Aromatisse, and Yveltal for Omega Ruby, and a Meloetta for both games.  I'm so close to completing the Pokedex, a challenge that I began 10 years ago with Pokemon Emerald.  It's somewhat fitting that I'm so close to completing that goal with the remake.</p><p>Also, between Pokemon White, Pokemon X, and Omega Ruby, I have several EV trained and move balanced Pokemon, that I could probably make a decent and competitive league team.  So I might start doing that next year.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokedex Completion History</b></div><p>Nearly 10 years ago, I picked up Pokemon Emerald and played it quite a bit with my girlfriend at the time.  We started doing this around the time Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green were released, so after we completed Emerald, I bought Fire Red, and she bought Leaf Green.  We ran through both games, and given our position, I suggested we could probably complete the Pokedex between the both of us.</p><p>We got close before giving up.  At the time, there were a possible 386 pokemon.  I think my Emerald pokedex was around 340, or 360, maybe?  For event pokemon, we had a Jirachi, but did not have Mew, Celebi, or Deoxys.</p><p>Then next time I really played Pokemon was when I studied abroad and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were released in Fall 2006.  Later, back in the states, I bought Pokemon Platinum on its release, and went all the way through that game.  Throughout this time, I was collecting each event Pokemon upon its availability.  Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out.  I started going through Soul Silver, but got bored.</p><p>When Pokemon White and Black were released, I actually had a friend who played and cared about the games, too.  I played through White and she played through Black.  We both caught all the exclusive Pokemon and traded them back and forth to complete our Pokedexes.</p><p>At this point, my dream to complete the Pokedex was rekindled.  Starting with Generation III (ruby / sapphire / emerald / leaf green / fire red), you could migrate your Pokemon to the next generation.  So all my Pokemon from Emerald could be moved to Platinum, and from Platinum to Pokemon White.  With my hefty amount of Pokemon from Emerald, and complete saves on Platinum and White, I was able to fill out the new rosters, and get closer.</p><p>I bought some of the older copies of the games to fill out the starters I was missing.  And I even bought a new Nintendo DS, so I could trade and transfer Pokemon between the Gen IV and Gen V games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" /></p><p>This was about 4 years ago.  After the release of Black and White 2, my Pokedex on Pokemon White was at 647 out of 649.  I was missing at Latios, which was available to capture in Pokemon Soul Silver, but I just got so bored playing that game.  And I was missing Meloetta, which was an event Pokemon not yet released.  Almost complete!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, Meloetta was released after I starting living in Japan, so I had no way of getting it.  Maybe I had a chance while in Japan, but I missed that opportunity.</p><p>Pokemon X and Y came out last year, bumping the total amount of Pokemon to 718, with an additional 3 event Pokemon yet to be released, announced, or even available in the Pokedex.  Pokemon X was rather boring, though.  There were very few new Pokemon, and the controls were somewhat rocky especially after playing Zelda.  I captured all the Pokemon, though, and during Christmas break, traded back and forth to complete the new set.</p><p>At the time, there was also no built-in way to transfer Gen IV Pokemon to the new games.  Later, an app was released, Pokemon Bank, that allowed you to do this.  I got bored with Pokemon X, so I left it.</p><p>But, ramping up to the release of Omega Ruby, and the release of Diancie, the 719th Pokemon, I started getting into Pokemon again.  I migrated all my Pokemon forward, and filled in any holes I was missing in my Pokedex.  I was now at 717, with only Meloetta and Latios missing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" /></p><p>Playing through Omega Ruby, they basically just give you Latios for free.  You don't even need to battle and catch it.  It felt somewhat empty to have finally catch this Pokemon without even a fight, but whatever.  *My Pokemon X Dex is still at 717, though, because I'm too lazy too transfer it.</p><p>I transferred all my Pokemon over to Omega Ruby, but I do not actually have a living "copy" of Aromatisse and Yveltal (from Pokemon X/Y), so my Omega Ruby Dex is at 716.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing the journey from 10 years ago to 4 years ago to today, these are the games and handhelds I have with me in Japan.  There are still some Pokemon left to capture and transfer from Soul Silver, so I might start playing that again.  My save is just after catching Lugia, and before Victory Road.</p><p>Anyway, <b>I'm so close!</b>  I'm only missing 3 pokemon, and the additional 2 yet unreleased event pokemon.  (Though, #720 Hoppa might be soon.)</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing</b></div><p>After playing the shit out of Pokemon White, I became more interested in some of the meta-game aspects of raising and breeding pokemon.  I designed, and started training a balanced EV trained team.  I completely trained 3 pokemon out of the 6 I had planned before I got bored, and gave up.</p><p>I started playing Pokemon X again right before Omega Ruby's release, and EV trained some more pokemon.  EV training is SO easy in Gen VI.  I am so thankful for that.  I completely trained 2 pokemon in that game.</p><p>And with Omega Ruby, I bred and EV trained 4 pokemon in Pokemon X, transferred them to Omega Ruby, and played through all of the game with them.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, with these pokemon, I think I'll make a team, and start competing online.  Why not, right?  With my sole goal of pokemon (finishing the Pokedex) basically complete, I should start getting into the aspect of pokemon that has really kept the franchise alive: battling and competing.</p><p>We'll see, though, maybe I'll lose a lot, get bored, and give up.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next?</b></div><p>I'm super interested to see what they have planned next.  With the addition of Mega evolutions, I think they've pretty much run out of ideas to keep Pokemon fresh.  Pokemon releases are now almost a yearly occurrence.</p><p>2007 = Pokemon Diamond + Pearl<br/>2009 = Pokemon Platinum<br/>2010 = Pokemon Heart Gold + Soul Silver<br/>2011 = Pokemon Black + White<br/>2012 = Pokemon Black + White 2<br/>2013 = Pokemon X + Y<br/>2014 = Pokemon Omega Ruby + Alpha Sapphire</p><p>I could totally see a Pokemon Z (or whatever) coming out in 2015, too.  Maybe that game would bring over all the engine fixes in Omega Ruby, and also correctly bridge the two games.  And perhaps have a lot of good end game content, too.</p><p>But, they really need to take a break.  Pokemon needs some breathing room.</p><p>Anyway, that's my story.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Video Game shopping in Toyama 富山市" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-shopping-in-toyama">Video Game shopping in Toyama 富山市</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 6, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When shopping for video games in Japan, I think a lot of people think about going to Akihabara in Tokyo, or perhaps Den Den Town in Osaka, or one of the other popularized meccas of video game and anime nerdom.  But, if you've ever gone to any popularized retro gaming place in the U.S., their selection is great, but their prices typically are not.  Much like the U.S., there are tons of used stores throughout the country, and they usually yield better scores.</p><p>I currently live in Takayama in Gifu, and while the gaming stores are pathetic in my city, Toyama <span class='ja'>富山市</span>, an hour and a half to the north, has quite a few, for some reason.  Gifu City <span class='ja'>岐阜市</span>, Kanazawa <span class='ja'>金沢市</span>, Matsumoto <span class='ja'>松本市</span>, and Nagoya <span class='ja'>名古屋</span> are within the same distance and time frame (in different directions), but they don't have nearly the cache Toyama does.  I don't know why.</p><p>I hadn't been on a video game shopping trip in quite a while, and my brother-in-law recently decided to repair and mod his Super Nintendo for import games.  He asked me to search for some games, along with the list of Famicom games I've been working on.</p><p>I'm not completely familiar with the Super Famicom library, but whatever. Let's go!</p><div class='title'><b>Shuttle <span class='ja'>シャトル</span> in Tonami <span class='ja'>砺波</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" /></p><p>I left my house around 8:30am, and went directly the first place on my list.  This was my first time going to Shuttle.  To find used game stores using Google Maps, I usually search for <span class='ja'>ファミコン</span>, and that pulls up stores that carry Famicom games.  Chances are if they carry those games, they carry all games.  Shuttle is the only thing that came up for Toyama, for some reason.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp"/></a></p><p>And Shuttle did not disappoint.  It's a massive nerd store with games, figures, porn, books, manga, fishing equipment, guns, cards, and some other stuff.  I started sifting through the Super Famicom games.

There's no way it was a single store.</p><p>Next!</p><div class='title'><b>Shuttle <span class='ja'>シャトル</span> in Takaoka <span class='ja'>高岡</span> Iguchihongo <span class='ja'>井口本江</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8448.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8448.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8448.webp" /><br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8450_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8453.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8453_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8453_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8453_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Another wall of Super Famicom games.

I'm sure there are plenty of other hidden gems in Toyama, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity PAX East Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">Cards Against Humanity PAX East Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 28, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, I just received most of the latest additions to Cards Against Humanity.  Some of these came out of PAX East, and the others followed a month or two afterward.  The updates include the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" /></p><p>2012 Holiday Pack<br/>2013 Holiday Pack<br/>90s Nostalgia Pack<br/>Pwnmeal 2014 PAX East Cards<br/>Crabs Adjust Humidity vol. 3</p><p>The 90s packs were available at PAX East, but are now available for everyone on the Cards Against Humanity website, along with the 2012 and 2013 Holiday Packs.  The Crabs vol. 3 set can be purchased from the Vampire Squid website along with the previous volumes.  The Pwnmeal cards on the other hand…</p><div class='title'><b>PWNMeal</b></div><p>With the recent explosion of food products advertised to gamers as "Extreme Gamer Fuel," Max Tempkin, the co-creator of Cards Against Humanity, and current boss, had a twitter conversation about its ridiculousness with his friends.  This turned into a back-and-forth about dumb names for foods they haven't come up with yet.  When the topic of extreme oatmeal was introduced, Max had an idea that he could not stop himself from completing.</p><p>On April 12th, at PAX East in Boston, Max unveiled PWNMeal at the Giant Bomb Panel.</p><p><br/>Cards Against Humanity created 150,000 package of PWNMeal, and gave them out to as many people as they could at PAX East.  Each PAX East swag bag included one pouch of PWNMeal.  </p><p>There are 4 different flavors of PWNMeal: Strawberries and Carnage, No Scope Headshot Blueberry, MOBAnana Bread, and Cinnamon K/D Ratioatmeal.  And they were complete with a prize inside!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" /></p><p>Each PWNMeal package contains 10 cards for Cards Against Humanity: 8 white cards, and 2 black cards, of which there are a total of 27 different cards.</p><p>I bought a few packages from eBay after PAX East had finished.  I think I paid about $10 for each package.</p><p>Here's the distribution of cards I received from the 5 packs:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" /></p><p>I'm still missing 4 cards: #12, #17, #22, and #25.  Unlike the PAX Prime 2013 cards, these seem pretty evenly distributed.  Seems like the first 10 are common.  The second 10 are slightly less common, but not too bad.  I think I just got unlucky with the black cards.</p><p>There are still some unfunny PAX memes and inside jokes, but for the most part, these cards aren't too bad.  There are some good additions. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Expansions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" /></p><p>With these new additions, I own the following official expansions:</p><p>An original set of Cards Against Humanity (I'm not sure which version)<br/>The First, Second, Third, and Fourth (Official) Expansions<br/>The Holiday 2012, Holiday 2013, Box, and 90s Nostalgia Packs<br/>The PAX East 2013, PAX Prime 2013, and PAX East 2014 PWNMeal Packs</p><p>And the following unofficial expansions:</p><p>The UK Expansion (Bootleg - read about it here: <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions" title="/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions">February 10th, 2014</a>)<br/>and.. Crabs Adjust Humidity volumes One, Two, and Three.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" /></p><p>Now, my Bigger Blacker Box is 100% full.  That expansion box holds all of my blank cards.  I think I'm going to need to buy a second box to store some cards.</p><div class='title'><b>Missing</b></div><p>There are still 4 official release from Cards Against Humanity that I'm missing:  The Canada Conversion Set, the Reject Pack, the House of Cards pack, and the PAX East 2014 Panel Packs.</p><p><b>Canada Conversion Set</b> is a small set of cards included with the Canadian version of the game.  Rather than create a completely separate Canadian version of the game, the creators simply released the same version of the game for Canada, but added a small pack of localized cards that were Canada specific.  I don't think these cards are marked in anyway.  Plus they're Canada specific, so they aren't that funny to me.  It's not really worth it for me to buy it.</p><p><b>The Reject Pack</b> is a small package of several cards rejected from the original release of the game.  Each card was selected by one of the creators of the game, and features a drawing of their portrait at the bottom of the card.  These packs were given away at fan events.  Sometimes they were given to people with corrected orders.  They show up on eBay every now and then, but sell for $100.</p><p><i>Update</i>: Actually, some retailers are selling these on amazon for $10.  I bought two packs from one of the sellers. It's possible that they're bootleg, though.</p><p><b>House of Cards Pack</b> was something I totally and completely missed.  Netflix and Cards joined together and released a pack of cards based of the House of Cards television program available on Netflix.  This happened in January (or February) this year.  There are some on eBay, but sell for $60.</p><p><b>PAX East 2014 Panel Packs</b>:  In addition to the PWNMeal cards at PAX East, the creators of Cards Against Humanity performed another crazy feat of marketing.  They held a panel on Saturday, and during the panel the audience suggested cards to the panelists.  The top 10 cards were compiled, and sent to a print-shop.  They were completed overnight, and handed out to the attendees the following day.  Around 200 of these cards were made, and only given to those who attended the panel.</p><div class='title'><b>Quality over Quantity</b></div><p>As they say, with so many cards, it can difficult to have some quality sessions of Cards Against Humanity.  Some of those Crabs cards just aren't funny, and don't really work in most situations.  The next time I get a chance to play with friends, I'm going to start separating the shitty useless cards into a separate pile.  Hence the need for a second black box. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tomodachi Life - Fashion Catalog" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tomodachi-life-fashion-catalog">Tomodachi Life - Fashion Catalog</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 16, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, Nintendo released <b>Tomodachi Life</b> on the Nintendo 3DS in the US.  It's a life simulation game which you create, or import Miis on your island, and they all live together, make friends with each other, marry each other, and have children. :)  Also, you give your Mii presents, and feed them, which makes their happiness meter go up.  They gain levels this way.  Each new level awards them with a special gift, either a catch phrase, a song, or some kind of permanent present.</p><p>The entertainment of the game is creating a bunch of Miis of your friends, or celebrities, and having them all interact with each other.</p><p>For example, the female Matt Rorey (of Giant Bomb) had feelings for Batman, so she confessed her love.  But then Samus broke in and confessed her love.  Batman chose Samus, and eventually they got married.  Matt Rorey eventually got over Batman when Shaq O'Neil confessed his love for her.  A few days later Matt Rorey asked Shaq for marriage, and he said yes. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Here's some of the Miis at their wedding.  There's Jesse Pinkman, me, Miyamoto, Tyrion Lannister, Alex Nevarro (of Giant Bomb), Batman, Weird Al, and Mr. Bean.</p><div class='title'><b>QR Codes</b></div><p>A really nice feature of Tomodachi Life is being able to share your Mii across the Internet using a QR Code.  Through the menus in the game, you can generate a code for yourself, and others can import you in their game.  It only imports my likeness, and settings.  I can't actually interact with anyone.  But the Miis basically just do whatever they want anyway.</p><p>Here's my Mii, if you'd like me in your game:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Additionally, Nintendo has created some special Miis based on celebrities you can import into your game with custom backgrounds, and clothes.  There's Christina Aguilera, Shaquille O'Neal, Debby Ryan, Shaun White, and Zendaya.  You can find those codes <a href="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/" title="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/">here</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japanese Special Miis</b></div><p>It's been over a year since its release in Japan.  I figured that they did something similar with the Japanese release.  It took me a while to find any official Miis for the game, but eventually I found <a href="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html" title="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html">this website</a>.</p><p>A few months after the Japanese release in April 2013, Club Nintendo released a book called <b>Tomodachi Collection - Fashion Catalog</b>.  It's 88 pages of custom Miis showing off various clothing items you can collect in the game.  Here's the <a href="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html" title="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html">official page</a>.</p><p>Since I wanted a ton of Miis, I went through an imported each one.  They each have gold pants, too!  But, all of them have Japanese names, which my US game won't pronounce.  Since they're special, I can't edit them either.</p><p>Additionally, I have no idea who they are.  Are all these Miis based on Japanese celebrities?  Or are they athletes.  I don't know, so I'm gonna go through each one and write up my findings.</p><div class='title'><b>Findings</b></div><p>Well, it didn't take too long after searching for these characters to realize they're all made up.  </p><p>Unlike the celebrity Miis on Nintendo of America's website, these characters were specifically made up for this catalog.  Throughout the catalog, the Miis show off all these clothes.  Every clothing item in the catalog is attached to the Mii character, so when you import them into your game, you get all their items.  But, then you're stuck with this Mii.</p><p><b>None of this works in the US version of the game.</b>  When you import the Mii, you're given the stock Mii character and none of their items.  So, they're really pointless, unless you want to expand the Mii population of game quickly.  Also, since they're special, if you delete them, you cannot reimport them.  Maybe in the future, Nintendo will patch the game for these Miis to work.  But even so, I've already imported them, so I've already ruined that chance.</p><p>All in all, <b>there's very little use to actually importing these characters in your America game</b>.  But, here's all the codes if you want a bunch of gold panted Miis in your game:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><img

| February 10, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of my favorite games these days is Cards Against Humanity.  For those who don't know about this game, it started as a Kickstarter 3 years ago.  Some friends in Chicago came up with a game similar to Apples to Apples but with much more hilarious or horrible responses depending on your point of view.</p><p>To play, all players draw 10 white cards.  White cards are usually nouns, phrases, or whatever.  Someone is chosen as the card czar, and they draw a single black card.  The read the black card, which is either a fill-in-the-blank, or a question, and the other players use one of their white cards to complete the black card.  The card czar then chooses the "best" card, which can be on any criteria they wish be it appropriate, inappropriate, or just funny.  The player whose white card was chosen gets the black card, and the person with the most amount of black cards wins the game.</p><p>I first bought my copy of the game at Pax Prime 2012.  At that time, there were 2 official expansions.  SInce then, there's been quite a bit more.  All in all, there's the following add-ons:</p><p>First, Second, Third, and Fourth (Official) Expansions<br/>Holiday Expansion (Christmas 2012)<br/>12 Days of Holiday Bullshit (Christmas 2013)<br/>PAX East 2013 Promo Packs<br/>PAX Prime 2013 Promo Packs<br/>(The ever elusive) Reject Pack<br/>The Bigger, Blacker Box (which includes the Box Expansion)<br/>and.. Crabs Adjust Humidity Volumes One and Two (Fan expansion from one of the creators)</p><p>Again, I'm a huge fan of the game, so I have everything listed above EXCEPT for the <b>Reject Pack</b> which has never been sold, and may not even be in production anymore.  People have said they've gotten it from events in Chicago, and sometimes when they've had to order replacement cards.</p><p>Here's my collection from after PAX Prime 2013 after purchasing the Box and getting most of the PAX Prime cards</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" /></p><p>Since then, I've added the Fourth Expansion, the Christmas 2013 Cards, and Crabs Adjust Humidity Volume Two.  And now, I've added one more thing...</p><div class='title'><b>Localized Editions</b></div><p>In addition, Cards Against Humanity has released a version in Canada and the UK with localized cards.  The Canadian edition only has a few changes, so the box includes a base USA set with an extra box labeled the Canada Expansion.  This is not available on its own, and the only way to get it is through Amazon Canada which doesn't ship to the US.</p><p>The UK Edition released overseas is much more localized.  So much so that there is no little expansion included in the box, it's all mixed in.  Several of the base USA cards have been changed slightly to reflect the English dialect over American.  Several USA cards have been dropped, with UK specific cards added as replacements.  They've gone to great lengths to actually make a UK version of the game, rather than just tacking on a couple cards.</p><p>Much like the Canadian edition of the game, annoying collectors and completists, such as myself, want to add these cards to my deck, even though there's plenty of English idioms I either won't get, or think are as funny as the US counterpart.</p><p>I was searching around eBay for both these localized editions (and the Reject Pack), and I came across the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The UK Expansion</b></div><p>Some seller from the UK, had this listed on eBay.  The "UK Expansion" it reads, and looks all official.  At the time, I searched around the internets, but didn't really see anything about it.  Everything kept coming up UK <u>Edition</u>, not Expansion.  But still, I was really curious.  Well, it was only $20 shipped, and would go anywhere in the world.  Why not?  I'll buy it and have it shipped to my place in Japan.</p><p>and It arrived today!  So here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" /></p><p>Oh yeah?  This thing is counterfeit.  The outside of the box is set to look exactly like the other expansions.  Lots of care was taken in making this thing look official.  Right down to the little version number each official Edition and Expansion has printed on the box.</p><p>The biggest give away are the cards themselves.  While they are the correct font, correct size, and basically the correct weight, there's no linen finish on the cards that give them the "player card" texture and feel.  They're just straight matte card stock.  It makes them feel pretty flimsy and cheap.</p><p>You can see it pretty well in this photo:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" /></p><p>But, honestly, while the card quality themselves is a pretty big deal, it's the only fault of these cards.  Everything else is damn near perfect.  A user on the Boardgame Geek forum wrote up a review about these cards as well, and details all the cards included in this set.  Weirdly, the set is actually missing a few cards from the UK Edition of the game.  And then included some US cards from the 1.5 version of the base set.</p><p>http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1119851/review-of-the-not-official-125-card-uk-expansion</p><p>But, overall, not bad.  They're even labeled as UK expansion, so you can easily tell them apart from the normal cards.  Though, the card stock is a real easy way to do that without even needing to look.  With the addition of this set, my Bigger, Blacker Box is nearly full!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" /></p><p>The extra box in there contains all my empty custom cards.  If I completed all those, I don't think I could fit another expansion.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>There is a down side to having all these cards, though.  How many times have you been playing this game, and have totally unplayable cards?  It's happens very often.  I think with the base set and the expansions, there were actually thinking about how to expand the deck and have more playable cards.  Ones that actually cleverly work with the black cards, and create more plausible, cohesive combinations.</p><p>But with the PAX cards, the Christmas cards, and DEFINITELY the Crabs cards, so many of the white cards turn into dead ends, and the hilarious combinations get lost with all the noise.</p><p>I think the next times that I play with friends, I'm going to start culling some cards and get rid of the fluff.  Collecting and completing collections is fun, but there's still the game to play underneath.  The collection shouldn't get in the way of that.  My deck needs to be tighter.  :)</p><p>I think the box is a good bar for the amount of cards any person should have.  Anymore, and you continue to dilute the quality of the hands you'll draw.  Plus, it's not like you'll actually finish a game to completion.  With just the base set and two expansions, it took about 4 or 5 hours to play through all the cards.  And now my box has more than twice that!</p><p>Though, I will say, I think the more black cards the better.  I don't think there are really any terrible black cards.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyway?</b></div><p>So, anyway, that's the UK Expansion.  It is counterfeit, so take that into consideration if you're thinking of buying it.  I haven't had a chance to play any games with the new cards, but hopefully I won't need to wait too long.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Bravely Default Demo" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/bravely-default-demo">Bravely Default Demo</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 13, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Probably my most hyped game at the moment is Bravely Default on the 3DS.  It's a semi-classic style Final Fantasy JRPG with artwork by Akihiko Yoshida.  It's the spiritual successor to The Heroes of Light on the DS, which itself was a spiritual remake of Final Fantasy 1.</p><p>Akihiko Yoshida was one of my favorite artists from Squaresoft during the Playstation era.  He did the artwork for Final Fantasy Tactics, and Vagrant Story, and then, more recently, Final Fantasy XII.  Though, Bravely Default does not fall in that universe.  He works a lot with Yasumi Matsuno, who designed all those games, too.</p><p>It was originally released in 2012, and is finally coming out in the US in about a month.  Two weeks ago, Nintendo released a demo on the eShop.  The demo is mostly stand alone.  It contains no story, and very little character interaction, and you're placed in an area that doesn't even exist in the full game.  It's simply meant to show off the Job system, the battle system, and the Street Pass stuff.  As well as part of the world, and the music, too.  As you progress through the demo, you unlock stuff you can transfer to the full game. :)</p><p>I started playing the demo yesterday, and it looks gorgeous.  Yoshida's art style is represented perfectly.  The characters and their costumes are vibrant and unique.  The enemies look really nice, too.  I love the flat look used in the village and the battles.  It doesn't compromise style for realism.</p><p>The demo itself is rather grindy, due to the lack of story, but I think it's still pretty fun.  You get a simple kill or fetch quest, complete it, then do the next one.  The jobs cap at level 4, so it allows you to experiment with several jobs and job combinations.</p><p>The Brave & Default battle system is pretty unique, and rather easy to understand.  When it's your character's turn, in addition to attack, magic, etc, you can choose to either Brave or Default.  Defaulting essentially saves a turn for later, and your character is put in defensive mode for the rest of the turn.  Brave will use multiple turns per round, up to 4.  You can only stock 3 turns, and going negative is OK, but characters can only participate in a round if they have 0 or more stocked turns. Stocked turns are simply called Brave points.</p><p>So, I pretty much just stock up on turns and then release a ton of moves in a single round later.  The extra defense from Defaulting is almost necessary for not getting killed right away.</p><p>This game does feature random battles, but in the settings, you can change the frequency of the encounter rate.  You can change is to 0 when you want to explore.  Or up it to 100, when you need to grind out some levels.</p><p>The demo is kinda long, too.  I think I'm about halfway through at 4 hours, and I've only unlocked two of the seven prize packs I can bring into the full game.</p><p>If you were a fan of Squaresoft back in the Playstation days, I would definitely recommend playing through the demo, and deciding whether or not this game is for you.  I've been pretty excited for this game, and the demo has definitely reassured me. :)</p><p>Also, if you have a Japanese 3DS, the recent re-release of the game with the subtitle, For the Sequel, is (nearly) the exact same game out in Europe now, and coming out in the US next month.  It has full English support, and I think might not have the censoring they added for the western market.</p><p><a href="http://bravelydefault.nintendo.com/demo" title="http://bravelydefault.nintendo.com/demo">http://bravelydefault.nintendo.com/demo</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Double Fine Adventure" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/double-fine-adventure">Double Fine Adventure</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 8, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Out of all the kickstarter projects I've backed and "invested" in, Double Fine Adventure has been the most rewarding and unique experience out of them all.</p><p>Tim Schafer and his pals at Double Fine launched the Double Fine Adventure kickstarter on February 8th this year, and asked for $400,000 dollars to make a game that they've always wanted to make.  And not only that, they planned on filming an episodic documentary about their entire process.  And open up their creative process to the backers of the project for suggestions and ideas on what they might want in the game.</p><p>Here's a link to their Kickstarter campaign:<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure" title="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure</a></p><p>33 days after their kickstarter, it ended at $3,336,372 with an additional couple hundred thousand dollars donated outside of kickstarter.  It was the most successful campaign that kickstarter had seen to date.  The whole games industry took note.  And plenty of other classic game developers took note, and started their own campaigns, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Psychonauts and Brutal Legend</b></div><p>I've been a big fan of Tim Schafer and Double Fine ever since I played <b>Psychonauts</b>. Psychonauts was the first game I played that Tim Schafer worked on, and playing through that game was an absolute delight (until the final stage).  The comedic dialogue, and funny characters worked themselves perfectly into the story, the game mechanics, and the overall world everything took place in.</p><p>It was one of the most fun and enjoyable experiences I've had with a game in quite a while.  And then they did it all again with <b>Brutal Legend</b> in 2009.  A perfect cohesive experience that carried its vision from start to finish with comedic tones guiding most of the mechanics of the world.</p><p>Not to say that these game aren't flawless.  But when the core concept of a game has a heart behind it, you can see past its flaws.</p><p>I wrote about both these games almost 3 years ago after finishing Brutal Legend<br/><a href="/old/v7/brutal-legend" title="/brutal-legend">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=673</a></p><p>Also, I got my copy of Brutal Legend signed by Tim Schafer!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4039.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Afterwards</b></div><p>Unfortunately, Brutal Legend sold terribly, and Double Fine really scaled back their games production.  Since Brutal Legend, I think Double Fine Adventure is the first game that Tim Schafer is actually directing himself.  They've made 5 games since then, and they have been rather small in scope, and mostly championed by other people on the Double Fine staff.</p><p>Tasha Harris, lead animator, directed <b>Costume Quest</b>, which was a cute downloadable game for XBLA, PSN, and Steam.  It featured a brother and a sister trying to save each other (depending on who you play as) from goblins during Halloween.  It was a turn-based RPG, and during the battles the kids would turn into the things they were costumed as for Halloween.</p><p>Lee Petty, art director, wrote and directed <b>Stacking</b>.  Stacking is about a kid trying to find his kidnapped family.  All the characters in the game are Russian Stacking dolls, and since you're the smallest, you can go inside other stacking dolls and use their character specific powers to solve puzzles and eventually rescue your family.</p><p>The Double Fine store sold a bunch of replicas of some of the characters in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4051.webp"  /></p><p>Then they did <b>Trenched</b> which was renamed to <b>Iron Brigade</b>.  Lead Designer, Brad Muir, headed up Iron Brigade.  This game is essential tower defense, but with a player playing a role on the field.  Your character pilots a mech and sets up missiles turrets to defend against evil broadcasting monsters.</p><p>The fourth game in this series is <b>Once upon a Monster</b> headed by lead programmer Nathan Martz.  Once upon a Monster stars all the monsters from Sesame Street in a learning game for kids using the Kinect.  According to Wikipedia, this initially wasn't intended to be a licensed game, but everything seemed to fit after working on it for a while.</p><p>All the mistakes and lessons learned from working with the Kinect spawned an unintended fifth game in the series entitled, <b>Double Fine Happy Action Theater</b>.  This Kinect title isn't so much a game, as it is a whole lot of random visualizations and interactions made possible with the Kinect.</p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Adventure</b></div><p>They're currently in the process of working on a game headed by Ron Gilbert, the creator of Monkey Island.  But Tim wanted to work on a game, too.  He hadn't been directly in charge of a game since Brutal Legend, and wanted to do something again.  And rather than shop an idea around from publisher to publisher to publisher getting rejected, he decided to do a kickstarter campaign and see what would happen.</p><p>And success happened.</p><p>And now we're 5 months after the Kickstarter has ended, and they've released 4 episodes of their documentary so far.  The first episode dealt with the creation of the kickstarter and its success.  The second episode dealt with Tim's creation process, and a few ideas he had come up with.  He also went over these ideas with Ron Gilbert, and they talked a little bit about what adventure games meant, and how they should be designed.</p><p>The third episode was Tim bringing his ideas to his team, getting feedback, and working through the feedback.  They also introduced Anna Kipnis as the lead developer, and her team setting up the animation and game engine.  They also came up with the codename for the project, "Reds", as they did the Double Fine pub crawl.</p><p>The fourth episode, released today, was an extended double length episode that focused on the concept artists for the project, and their process.  They introduced Peter Chan, and Scott Campbell, visited their work spaces, and their lives.  They also introduced Nathan "Bagel" Stapley as the lead artist for the project, and showed him off too.</p><p>Each episode has been about a month apart, and has really shown the project taking shape.  From the small ideas that Tim had in episode two, into some fleshed out stories, and concept art in episode four.  Each episode has done a fantastic job focusing on the passion of everyone involved, and especially with Tim himself.  With all the money they raised, he's able to hire all the people he really loves and inspires him to create great things.</p><p>The whole idea with this project has been to create something that was completely outside of publishers.  For his process, publishers tend to stifle and warp his ideas into something that sells, rather than something that comes from the heart.  And even though I feel like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend had plenty of heart, I wonder just how toned down they were from the original idea.</p><p>It's great to see a creative team have all the freedom they want, and have them explain what inspires them, and ultimately what makes them happy.  And given that I've loved almost all of their games, it's really fulfilling and inspiring to me to see it build and come together.</p><p>It's pretty great.</p><div class='title'><b>Double Fine Adventure Swag</b></div><p>And additionally, they've actually fulfilled all of their upfront physical goods too.  I pledged $100, which awards a physical copy of the Game and the Documentary in a classic over-sized PC box.  Those will obviously only be available upon completion of the game and documentary, but the upfront goods I got are a Poster, and a T-shirt!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4033.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120808_doublefine/IMG_4036.webp"  /></p><p>It includes a sticker, and a button too!</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I'm certainly looking forward to all the rest of the episodes.  But!  In the immediate future, Double Fine is going to have a bit of a presence at PAX this year.  They plan on having a booth in the exhibition hall, they are having a panel specifically on Double Fine Adventure, and they are taking part of two other panels.</p><p>Friday @ 1pm : Double Fine Adventure Panel w/ Tim Schafer (Double Fine), Greg Rice (Double Fine), Paul Levering (Player 2 Productions), and Cindy Au (Kickstarer).  They are showing some clips from the documentary and then answering a bunch of questions.</p><p>Saturday @ 7:30pm : Canceled &amp; Prototyped Games w/ Brad Muir (Double Fine), Amir Rao (Supergiant), Dan Teasdale (Twisted Pixel), and Sylvain Dubrofsky (Popcap).</p><p>Sunday @ Noon : Plot v. Play - Duality of Modern Game Design w/ Ben Gilbert (Joystiq), Jason Schreier (Kotaku), Tim Schafer (Double Fine), and Erik Wolpaw (Valve).</p><p>I plan on attending each of one of these, but I especially plan on attending the Double Fine Adventure one.  </p><p>Additionally, The Cave is going to be in the Exhibition Hall at SEGA's booth.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Minecraft" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-minecraft">Lego Minecraft</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 15, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I finally received my very own set of Minecraft Legos, as well as a couple of stickers.  I think this is the first Lego product I've bought (or received) in the last 20 years.  Some might think the idea of Lego Minecraft is ironic.  Others might say this serves absolutely no purpose.  Some might say this was only a matter of time.  And others might say it's art imitating art.</p><p>Minecraft is a computer game developed by swedish person Markus Persson, where you can destroy any piece of the environment, pick that piece up, and place it where ever you want.  Many people describe this game as Legos in of itself, as you move around pieces, and build whatever you want.  That's the mining part of Minecraft.</p><p>The other part of Minecraft is the crafting.  You can take these pieces that you've mined and created new objects, and build more elaborate structures beyond what the environment has given you to begin with.  And you can do whatever you want.</p><p>Many people describe Minecraft is "playing with Legos." In fact, you could argue that Minecraft is the truest most best Lego video game ever created.  Lego has put its stamp on countless other games and all that them fail at the basic concept of what Lego is 'built' on...</p><p>So it IS deeply ironic that this concept has come full circle into the physical realm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Development</b></div><p>This set of Legos has been in development since November last year.  As you might have noticed above, the brand Lego Cuusoo is thrown around a little bit.  Cuusoo is an online development program where Lego creators bring their ideas to a vote.</p><p>Here's the original Cuusoo entry for Minecraft : <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038" title="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038">http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038</a></p><p>All Cuusoo ideas are submitted and put to a vote.  If the idea gets 10,000 supporters, it goes into a development phase where the creators must prove their idea.  Once they've come up with a physical build of the Lego product, it's put in front of a panel of judges, and they vote on whether or not the product actually comes to market.</p><p>Legos are WAAYYYY more serious these days then they were when I was a kid.  I mean, at heart, they are still a kid's toy, and they plenty of sets for children.  But they have advanced sets for the people who grew up with the toy, and enjoy the simple aesthetic.  And even beyond that, this Cuusoo system is there for the people who enjoy building something out of nothing: The architect.  These days the toy goes beyond an age range, and delves into the intellectual range.</p><p>It's awesome that there's this creative outlet for all Lego architects out there, but I've almost always been more interested in the building aspect of Legos.  I liked deviating from the instructions when I was a kid, but I never had the resources to build something from nothing.  These days you can visit any of the Legoland locations and buy any specific Lego piece you need.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Building</b></div><p>Building this thing was pretty fun.  I followed the instructions, and built everything 'correctly'.  Minecraft has always been about digging under the surface and finding all the hidden treasures.  Through building a scene of your own, you are doing the exact opposite.  You are placing all the hidden ore, and items in the environment and covering them up.  It's almost like you're acting like the scenery generator in the game itself.</p><p>There are gold blocks and diamond blocks that are very obviously placed, but there are other elements placed within the scene that are completely obscured when viewing the finished product.  In the end, the builder is the only one that knows they're there.  It's a secret.</p><p>There's also a Lego Steve, and a Lego Creeper available in the set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess it's kind of dumb.  Despite Legos' timeless and ageless construction, I feel like I've grown out of them.  I loved them as a kid, but the aesthetic just doesn't do anything for me anymore.  I get that the limited construction of the tool has pushed the creativity of its users well beyond what it was originally intended for, and built its own community, Cuusoo, based on that, but...  I just feel like I'm passed them.  I don't enjoy the aesthetic anymore.  It's too distinctive.</p><p>Once the Lego structure is built...  then what?  It just sits on display.</p><p>But... I do appreciate this Lego set.  <b>I find it as art imitating art.</b> There are clear choices made in its construction that imitate the game exactly.  A 1x1x2 block of Lego is equivalent to a block in Minecraft, and that is consistent throughout the entire model.  You can't really mine any of the pieces, but its construction and existence mirrors the game.</p><p>It's very well done, and representative of the game.  Much like the feeling of building a home, or any structure in Minecraft channels the fun you had with Legos as a kid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway...  I like it.  I feel like the abstract nature of Lego is a perfect physical representation of Minecraft.</p><div class='title'><b>Update : June 18th</b></div><p>As you may have noticed from one of the photos above, I had enough Legos to make an extra head for Steve.  I did not have enough pieces left over to make a body, though, so I saw this as a sign to complete one of those quirky life goals on my bucket list: <b>Go to Legoland to purchase a single Lego piece.</b></p><p>I was in Chicago this weekend, and the suburbs of Chicago have two Lego stores right next to each other.  There's the Lego Store in Woodfield Mall, and the Lego Discovery Center just outside.  Each store has a thing called 'Pick a Brick' where they have bins of multiple colors and sizes of Legos bricks, and you can fill up a bucket with all the pieces you want.  It's generally $10 for 10lbs (if I recall), and the selection is limited for each store.</p><p>The Lego Discovery Center has the exact sized block I needed, but only in Bright Orange.  I went inside the Woodfield Mall, and they didn't have any bricks of that size at all.  BUT!  The trip was still a success.  I was able to purchase my 1x1 brick and create a friend for Steve to play with.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to E3 2012" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/e3-2012">E3 2012</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 8, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Each year, all the high profile gaming companies get together in Los Angeles, and showcase all of their upcoming tech and games for the next year, and beyond.  This is E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, and for gamers, it's one of the most exciting times of the year.</p><p>I really wasn't sure what to expect from E3 this year.  I was excited, but really had no idea what they were going to show, or what surprises might await.  For some us, the anticipation and excitement of being surprised is just like Christmas.</p><p>Gaming really hasn't been all spectical and fun for the last year.  Every month, another couple of game studios go bankrupt and shut down.  Every month, the larger AAA games being released are more homogeneous.  And the games that were once interesting and fresh, end up being canceled or compromised by the mainstream.  It really feels like the games industry is dying, and grasping on to whatever sales are left.</p><p>All the press conferences of E3 felt like it mirrored that sentiment.  They showed off many sequels, and "announced" many games that we had already seen, and knew were in the pipeline.</p><p>But there were a couple games I'm looking forward to.  All is not lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Watch Dogs</b></div><p>Out of all 5 press conferences, this was the only surprise.  A new game that wasn't leaked ahead of time, and a completely new IP as well.  After showing boring title, after boring title, Ubisoft ended with a vague introduction of how digitally interconnected our society is, and how easily it can be exploited.</p><p>This went into a gameplay video where your character can make use of the digital world to get around hurdles in the physical world.  You can listen to phone conversations, disrupt power, and view personal information about any random person walking around.</p><p>This character eventually gets into a confrontation, and engages in a fire fight.  Even though you have these digital powers, you still need a gun to fight. :(  Then he takes off in a car and drives away.</p><p>Watch Dogs is open world too, and from the content, it seems like you're connected to the mob or some other organization.  So, if you boil all the elements down, it's basically Grand Theft Auto, but with internet powers.  BUT!  It takes place in Chicago!  Plus, it looks really really pretty.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA">Youtube Link</a></p><div class='title'><b>Beyond</b></div><p>Sony began it's conference by showing off Quantic Dream's newest game, Beyond.  Studio lead David Cage took the stage and introduced Beyond's main character, Jodie, played by Ellen Page.  They played a cutscene from the game that displayed the range of emotions and tones that you could expect from the game, and finished off with a sizzle clip of some action sequences.</p><p>I like Quantic Dream quite a bit, even though both Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain had their problems.  I like the idea of interactive story, and being able to change the story based on what I've done.  Both those game have that, but missed a note here or there that broke the suspension of disbelief.  Overall, if you let yourself be immersed into it's direction, and atmosphere it becomes an amazing immersive experience.</p><p>Beyond looks like it continues the story driven gameplay that Heavy Rain set out to do.  People who've played it on the show floor, have said that it is much more interactive than Heavy Rain too.  I'm definitely looking forward to this one.</p><div class='title'><b>The Last of Us</b></div><p>Sony ended it's conference with its other big big title.  The Last of Us is post apocalyptic, and takes place in the crumbling city of Pittsburg Pennslyvania.  You play as Joel, and have your 14 year old daughter, Ellie in tow.  It's a third person survival action game, as you search for food, water, and other supplies while avoiding confrontations, and survival any hostile encounters.</p><p>They showed off a live demo of Joel and Ellie making their way through an apartment building and running into a group of hostile men.  It turns into a fire fight, but you only have so many bullets, and have to make use of the environment, and anything around you to survive.  The confrontation goes back and forth between fists and guns.</p><p>Ellie and Joel react and make comments to the situation, as things happen, which is a mainstay of any Naughty Dog title these days.  Uncharted was so entertaining and engaging because of all the banter between Nathan Drake and his pals.  One previewer said that Ellie acted with complete shock when you, as Joel, lit a moltave cocktail and ignited a random dude, and another guy said that didn't even happen in his demo.</p><p>And Ellie interacts in the fights as well.  If you're in trouble during a fight, she might run up a stab the guy in the back, or throw a brick at someone about to shoot you.  The combat has a lot of variety, and she seems to react with just as much variety, too.</p><p>The environments look gorgeous, and all of their previous games have followed through with an engaging and interesting story.  I'm looking forward to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Castlevania Lords of Shadows : Mirrors of Fate</b></div><p>The first game Nintendo showed off during its 3DS conference was Castlevania.  It's been nearly 4 years since we've a side scrolling portable Castlevania game on the Nintendo platform.  It's been so long that I guess I'm excited no matter how the game actually turns out.</p><p>It's a 2.5D game where you play as multiple character in their rebooted universe.  The style reminds me a lot of the PSP game Castlevania Dracule X Chronicles.  But they really isn't any word if it'll be as open world as the Igarashi games were.  I hope it's open world, but a level based Castlevania with branching paths sounds pretty fun too.</p><p>Castlevania is fun, so I'd probably buy this if I had a 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>New Super Mario Bros. 2</b></div><p>New Super Mario 2 looks pretty fun, too, even though it is just more Mario.  This game is all about coins, and trying to collect 1 million coins throughout the course of the game.  They don't really explain why, though, and the whole concept is rather goofy.  100 coins still give you a 1-up, so you'll be drowning in lives as your progress in the game.  I doubt the difficulty will warrant that many 1-ups.  Plus, isn't Wario supposed to be the money-grubbing character?  Why does Mario need all this capital?</p><p>They announced this game along side New Super Mario Bros. U for the Wii U, which is a completely separate game.  I'm not really sure what their gameplan is when they saturate the market with two nearly identical games.</p><p>I dunno...  I liked New Super Mario on the DS, but didn't like New Super Mario on the Wii, so I think that I'll enjoy this new one for the 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Games</b></div><p>I'll probably buy those 5 games in the future, but there were a couple other games that seemed like they might be fun, but I wouldn't really want to own them.</p><p>The new <b>Tomb Raider</b> looks like it's taking a page out of Uncharted's book, except with worse dialogue and horrible acting.  The whole Uncharted series was based on Tomb Raider, so it feels somewhat odd that originator is now the follower, but whatever.  I'd like to play it.</p><p><b>Assassin's Creed 3</b> looks kinda fun too.  The whole series is about going back in time viewing key moments in history, and now the setting is the American Revolution is the foundation of our country.  I'm interested to see how that fits into something I know a little bit more about rather than Italy, and the other settings.  Also, the ship-based combat looks really pretty, and I love running around in snowy environments.</p><p>The new <b>Need for Speed</b> looks a lot like Burnout Paradise, one of my favorite racing games.  Criterion is behind both games, and as long as it controls more like Burnout Paradise and less like Need for Speed, I think I'll be playing this game quite a bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Huge Disappointments</b></div><p>There was good to be found, amongst all the negativity.  But there were two particular moments of E3 that were absolutely disappointing for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 3</b></div><p>I like Dead Space 1 quite a bit.  It had a wonderful immersive atmosphere that made full use of sound to convey emotion.  There were some points where the environment was so loud, you couldn't hear anything else, and there were points of silence where you begged for something to make a sound.  I was completely immersed through and through, and felt like I was there.</p><p>Dead Space 2 began tearing away at that immersion.  Sound wasn't used as heavily, as it relied on scare tactics and some particularly grotesque and horrorific moments to make up for it.  Ultimately, the whole experience felt cheap.  Dead Space 2 was now a horror action game.  You were no longer immersed in exploration.  Plus, they added a multiplayer mode to the game?  The fuck?</p><p>The Dead Space 3 demo shown during the EA conference makes it seem like they don't even know what made Dead Space unique in the first place.  It's completely co-op, and cover-based now you're fighting other humans.  Your weapons no longer rotate or have secondary fires, and you combine them into new weapons?  No more unique ammo either?  They're basically phoning this one in.</p><p>During the demo sequence Isaac and Harry(?) are fighting a drill that has gone hay-wire, and the whole time Harry is freaking out and screaming, "Oh my god", "Shit", "Fuck".  Does this time even know what terror is?  Having a character forcing his emotions on you is not compelling or immersive, it's fucking annoying.  I would probably try to kill him during the fight just to shut him up.</p><div class='title'><b>Wii U</b></div><p>I came into the conference pretty excited for the Wii U.  My Wii has got quite a bit of use over the last 6 months with Legend of Zelda, Xenoblade, and Rhythm Heaven.  Plus, there's The Last Story coming out in a few months, too.  I wanted to know that these games will look great on the new console, and when it'll come out, and how much it'll cost.  Plus, I wanted to know what games I might want to play on it.</p><p>They showed off the finished version of the console, along with a proper Pro controller perfect for playing games without any gimmicks.  They showed off a whole lot of boring games, along with some Wii U version of games already released for PS3 and 360.  They showed off <b>Pikmin 3</b> which looks fun but not a lot different than Pikmin 2.  And that's it.</p><p>They didn't give a price.  They didn't give a date.  They didn't announce any compelling game experience.   They didn't say anything worthwhile at all.  Why should I buy the Wii U?  They gave me no reason at all.  And that's especially disappointing because before this week, I was excited.  I didn't really need a whole lot of convincing.  I only needed a really great game, and I probably would've bought one.  But Pikmin 3 is not that game, and there's NOTHING else that looks interesting at all.  NOTHING.</p><p>Gamers are supposed to be excited for a new console, and there's nothing compelling or interesting.  Plus, the lineup doesn't have anything from EA or Activision.  The largest 3rd parties have no presence on this console.  So, the only games we'll ever really play on this thing are going to be from Nintendo?  It's going to be the Wii all over again.  It's a complementary console, rather than your main console.</p><p>What a waste...</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So, anyways.  The Playstation 3 looks pretty good in the next year.  And the 3DS is starting to build a decent library.  There's plenty of other games that were shown off on the floor for these two platforms that look great such as Sound Shapes, and Unfinished Swan.  Other interesting games have been announced for the USA such as Tokyo Jungle, Code of Princess, and First of the North Star 2.  There's also Bioshock Infinite, and Ni no Kuni coming out too!</p><p>E3 was pretty disappointing but there's lots of random stuff to look forward to.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards of Legend" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-of-legend">Cards of Legend</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 7, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I got a package in the mail today from Fangamer.  A couple of weeks ago they listed a set of Legend of Zelda playing cards that looked rather pretty.  They were created by Internet user, Nelde.
