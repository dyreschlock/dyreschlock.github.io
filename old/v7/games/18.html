| December 18, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mass Effect has a total of 45 achievements that can all be yours if you play through the game a minimum of 3 times, but even then you might screw yourself out of an achievement because you didn't do something you thought you were supposed to do.  Mass Effect has a lot of moments like that..</p><p>Because of the decisions I made, I need to play through Mass Effect a minimum of 4 times to gain all the achievements now...  I just completed it for the second time, so that leaves 2 more to go!</p><div class='title'><b>Counter Based Achievements</b></div><p>24 of these achievements I would class as counters..  Do this or collect this a certain amount of times and you get the achievement.</p><div class='title'><b>Kill things this many times (2 achievements)</b></div><p>A couple of these you'll easily get on your own.. like 250 synthetic kills, 150 organic kills..  I think i'd be more difficult if you completed the game killing less than 250 synthetics.</p><div class='title'><b>Use your weapon or heal 150 times (5 achievements)</b></div><p>There are 4 achievements for killing an enemy 150 with each type of gun.  These are pretty easy too.  Once you get one achievement, start using a different weapon.  There's an achievement for using 150 medi-gels..  Not too tough..  Just lead your cohorts into the line of fire and then heal them afterward.  As you continue through the game, you'll get it in no time.</p><div class='title'><b>Alignment (2 achievements)</b></div><p>These are 2 achievements for alignment.  If you reach 75% paragon, you get an achievement and the same with renegade.  Gamefaqs has a few glitches to earn infinite paragon and infinite renegade, but I couldn't get them to work.  It's pretty easy to tell which conversation options will get your paragon and renegade, but throughout the game there isn't enough to get both achievements in one play through.  You'll need to get one on the first playthrough, one on the second.  If you're achievement-whoring this game, this is no big deal.</p><div class='title'><b>Do something 75 times (11 achievements)</b></div><p>The real pain are those pesky "use this ability 75 times" achievements of which they are 11 for a mere 15 points each.  It's pretty easy to get in the habit of using your abilities, but those Tech abilities are not too useful in battle.  I really don't know what the point of these achievements are..  What do we really achieve by using these abilities 75 times?  If anybody has more than 6 or 7 of these achievements, you can tell they have a lot of time on their hands..  They take absolutely no skill to achieve..  Just time and consistency.</p><p>I have no idea if you get the achievement if instruct your party member to do the ability the 75 times, or if your character has to be the one to do it. I will probably test this out in my third playthrough.</p><div class='title'><b>One million Dollars (1 achievement)</b></div><p>Lets see..  2, 6, 7, 9, 20.. one of the remaining 4 is getting 1,000,000 space credits.  This is not a challenge what-so-ever.  Just be an item-whore, which is standard for RPGs (getting all items everywhere), and selling off the ones you don't need.  You'll reach 1,000,000 way before the end of your first play through.  In fact, it didn't take too long in my second playthrough to hit the max of 99,999,999 credits and 999 omni-gels.</p><div class='title'><b>Level 50 & 60 (2 achievements)</b></div><p>Another 2 counter-based achievements are for experience.  You get an achievements when you reach level 50 and level 60.  You should be able to hit level 50 in your first playthrough if you do absolutely everything.  <b>Hint: You gain twice the amount of experience if you kill enemies outside of your lunar rover.</b>  Well, more accurately, killing things with the lunar rover will cut the gained experience more than half..  At the end of my first play through, I was 6,000 xp away from level 50.</p><p>Getting to level 60 is a royal pain.  You need 860,000 experience points to get level 60 and at the end of my second playthrough on New Game+, I ended around 750,000..  So i'll need to do another New Game+ with the same character i've been playing for 50 hours now to hit the 60th level.</p><p>You need to complete one playthrough before unlocking levels 51 through 60.</p><div class='title'><b>Scholar (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The final collection-based achievement is "Scholar", which is finding all the main Codec entries for the main alien races of the Mass Effect Universe.</p><p>You can get this achievement before you leave the citadel the first time, but you can screw yourself by not asking the right questions..  Before Eden Prime, ask Captain Anderson about the Protheans, and right after Eden Prime, ask Anderson about the Geth.  Those are the only two entries you can miss.  The other ones you can get by talking with Avina terminals, the Hanar in the Presidium Emporium, the Elcor in his embassy and the Volus dude in the Elcor embassy.  Once you're a spectre, talk to Anderson about the Batarians.  That should do it.</p><p>There's a full list in this faq: <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960</a>.  Search for [SCH].</p><div class='title'><b>Progression Based Achievements</b></div><p>17 of Mass Effects' achievements I would consider progression based...  meaning, you get an achievement when you beat a level or progress through the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Beat the game (7 achievements), Do Stuff (2 achievements)</b></div><p>You cannot beat the game without getting 7 of these, but the other 3 are more sidequest related.  "Completing the game a second time" and "Landing on an Uncharted world" are self explanatory.</p><div class='title'><b>Fuck a party member (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The one side-quest achievement I missed on my first playthrough was the romantic subplot, which is pretty easy to get..  I was looking in the wrong place.  Just like real life.. :/</p><p>The romantic subplot involves you (the main charcter) and one of two party members.  If you're male, you can get it on with Ashley or Liara.  If you're female, you can sex up Kaidan or Liara.  Be sure to talk with the teammate you're hot for after each main mission, and you'll be in bed with them right before or after Ilos.</p><div class='title'><b>Complete the Majority of the game (7 achievement)</b></div><p>Completing 75% of the primary assignments and 75% of the secondary assignments will net you the main achievement, but there are 6 other achievements for each party member.  You must have them in your party at the time of completing that quest for it to count.  So be prepared for the Long haul.</p><p>Getting the achievement for Ashley and Kaidan is quite easy since you have them in your party from the start.  You get Garrus in your party pretty early too.  Wrex and Tali aren't too bad, but you'll need to put them in your party right away and never switch them out.</p><p>Liara is the most difficult to achieve.  You'll need to ignore all the sidequests in the citadel and go to Artemis Tau immediately after becoming a Spectre.  Once completed, head back to the citadel and complete all those sidequests are go from there.</p><p>I really had no idea how to get these achievements, so after two playthroughs, I only have 3 out of 6.  On my next playthrough, I'll probably go for Wrex and Liara since I've been playing with the same people for both games and I need a break.</p><div class='title'><b>Skill Based Achievements</b></div><p>There are 4 achievements that require actual skill.</p><div class='title'><b>Beat the game on this difficulty (2 achievements)</b></div><p>"Complete Mass Effect on Hard" and "Complete Mass Effect on <em>Insane</em>".  The gamefaqs guide says to get these achievements you must select your difficulty in the options before you start a new game.  However, I was able to get the Hardcore achievement by switching my game from Normal to Hard as soon as was able to after starting a New Game +.</p><div class='title'><b>Tactician (1 achievement)</b></div><p>I got this one without any trouble, so you probably don't need to worry about it.  I'm guessing the description is self explanatory:  The total amount of damage you sustain will be absorbed by your shields MORE than one your person.</p><div class='title'><b>Charismatic (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The description reads "resolve an impossible situation with charm or intimidation".  Basically, level up your charm or intimidation based on your alignment and there are 2 instances I know of where you must choose all the charm or all the intimidation conversation options.  These 2 times are: on Virmire when Wrex gets all pissed off about killing Krogan, and at the end of the game when you face Saren.</p><div class='title'><b>My own progression</b></div><p>Personally, I have 29 out of these 45 achievements.  I like playing Mass Effect quite a bit so I'll probably go through at least once more, but some of these achievements are really a waste of time.  I just need to reach level 60 with my current character, then i'll start over with a male character and a new class finally.</p><p>Also, I think my addition is off a little bit on the above numbers..</p><p>Sources have been <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960">this Gamefaq</a>, Gamefaqs in general, and personal experience.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 &quot;Fall&quot; Update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-fall-update">Xbox 360 "Fall" Update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 13, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Man.. I like the new "fall" update to the 360. It does 2 things that I really like: faster window shades and daily updates.</p><p>Moving from window to window in the console overhead is around 2 times faster after the update. You can actually accomplish things rather quickly, rather than having a second lag for the animation. If someone sends me a message, I can run into the console and view it lickidity split. I wonder if the second or two lag from before was because of some query process, or if it was the speed of the animation.</p><p>The daily updates are great too. Now you can actually see what has been added to Xbox Live since you've been gone. It flashes, too, to indicate something new has been added since the last time you connected. There's so much stuff being added online that everyday it flashes with an update. Far more frequent than the Wii.</p><p>You can also stream divx too, but I haven't messed around with that yet. Good Stuff overall. It makes managing the 360 stuff much faster and easier. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mail Call - Katamari PSP Case" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mail-call-katamari-psp-case">Mail Call - Katamari PSP Case</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been trying to get a hold of one of these things for months now.  It looks kinda big though... and crappy :/</p><p>I mean.. look inside of this thing:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" /></p><p>There's nothing at all..  no padding, no soft inards, no nothing to keep it from scratching up my screen either.. what a rip.</p><p>It is rather big though.. let's compare it to the standard Sony PSP sleeve.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" /></p><p>Christ.. this case is big, it wasn't my eyes playing tricks ...

Let's give him some breathing room.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0957.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0957.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0957.webp" /></p><p>There we go...</p><div class='title'><b>eBay Background</b></div><p>Finally, I got my hands on this stupid thing.  I've been trying to buy one of these cases off ebay ever since I first bought my PSP, but things had always gone wrong when trying to secure the highest bid.</p><p>The first couple times I just bid for it and then never checked up on it, thus lost the auction when someone swooped in at the end at sniped the auction from underneath me.  I didn't think the Katamari case was that sought after but FINE.  If that's the way you want to play it, then I guess we'll need to play the ebay sniping game.  I've sniped auctions before and its not that tough.</p><p>Well it is that tough when you aren't paying attention.  Each subsequent auction I put on my view list, I completely forgot about the time it ended.  Most of them ended on the weekend, so when I got to work Monday morning, there would be an email in my inbox, "An ending on your watch list is ending soon"..  Though, it would've already been ended at this point.</p><p>There were a few times I was this close to winning but I still got away from me.  One such instance happened a couple Mondays ago, when the auction ended at 7:30p and I totally remembered.  I wrote a reminder on my hand, remembered!, and perched myself in front of the computer on ebay hitting the F5 button.  I was pysched!</p><p>I kept hitting F5, 10 minutes remain..  F5, 7 minutes remaining..  "Oh, I could bid.. but there's always that slight chance someone will snipe my snipe.."  F5, 4 minutes remaining..  oh, so very close..  I'll wait until 1 minute and do it.  F5, 2 minutes remaining..  F5..  server cannot be found.  WHat?!?!  F5, F5, F5..  server cannot be found.  GODDAMN ROUTER!  Thankfully the episode of Heroes that night was one of the best I've seen, so I got over it pretty quick.</p><p>So I missed that one too..  But, eventually I preveiled and got my case. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Item Background</b></div><p>Originally this was the pre-order bonus for Me and My Katamari in Japan.  I don't think they ever brought this pre-order bonus to America when it was released in March 2006?  Was that when it came out?  We love Katamari was 2005, so it had to be 2006 sometime..  maybe May-ish 2006.</p><p>Anyways and Unfortunately, Me and My Katamari is absolutey horrible.  The game setup isn't too bad, you float around on islands and rebuilds islands in the ocean.  Pocket-sized goals for a pocket-sized katamari..</p><p>The gameplay is what kills this game.  Katamari requires 2 analog sticks, and the PSP has one.  I guess they thought using the D-pad and buttons would be a good substitute for analog sticks, but they are dead wrong.  I would love to play this game, if i could hook up a ps2 controller to my psp.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Anywho..  horrible game.  pretty crappy bonus.  Thankfully, it can hold the PSP and the PSP sleeve in the case, so it's not all bad.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-impressions">Mass Effect Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I purchased the limited edition version, which is only available online.</p><p>I probably should've bought it from amazon, rather than the price gouging money grubbing monolith Gamestop, but I'm actually satisfied that they got me the game before the thanksgiving day weekend.  I was scheduled to get the game on Monday, but it's here today ^_^.  I can't complain about that.</p><div class='title'><b>Goodies</b></div><p>Anywho.. here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" /></p><p>Lots and lots of Mass Effect goodness.  I got the pre-order bonus with it as well, so overall I have 1) the game, 2) 2 bonus discs with extra content, 3) an art book with pretty concept art (unlike the crappy halo 3 artbook), 4) a log book with background and information on the worlds and aliens of Mass Effect, and 5) a crappy tin box to hold everything in.  This crappy tin is far better than the Halo 3, so it's not all bad.  I'm still keeping my game in the pre-order box for easy access, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Character creation</b></div><p>When beginning Mass Effect, you have the choice of playing John Shepard, or creating your own character.  I created a custom male character and began playing the game, but I could not continue.  My dude looked like a chump..  How am I supposed to care about some guy I'd run into at a bar?  I scrapped that game and began anew with a female lead..</p><p>The character is much more solid compared to Oblivion.  The controls and customization are so loose in Oblivion, you really have to work on a character to not be Ugly.  Even the random generated characters look like crap.  Not so with Mass Effect..  You really have to work on a character to make them Ugly.</p><p>The characters look really nice, but all the guys look rather plain.  I would rather play as John Shepard, than a custom male character.  The female custom characters are pretty hot though..  The character I ended up creating looks like a young badass Captain Janeway.</p><p>Before you mess with looks, you have to choose your character's past.  You have 3 choices for childhood, and 3 choices from military past.  For childhood you can be an Earther, living on the streets, running tricks, and joining the military as a last resort (much like Captain Tylor), a Colonist, whose home was destroyed by an invading alien race (kinda like the dude in Nadesico), or Military, both parents alive and raised you while serving (kinda like every macross character).</p><p>Your 3 choices from military past are Sole Survivor, where you were the sole survivor of a failed mission, War Hero, where you have battled and lead your team victoriously, or Ruthless, where you'll win a battle at any cost.</p><p>You also choose your ailments, where it be all out gunplay, techplay or magic, or a combination of two.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>When you're out on a mission, you are shooting up evil aliens in Gears of War / Rainbox Six style.  Third person shooting and killing while commanding your team to do certain things.. like heal or attack.  Much like KOTOR, you have a party of 3.</p><p>It's pretty fun so far, but I REALLY miss the melee attack from Halo 3.  The melee attack really is the last line of defense between you and your enemy and being forced to shoot an enemy at point blank range seems unnatural now.</p><p>Oh well, I'm not supposed to let enemies that close anyways..</p><p>blah blah .. what else can I really say about the gameplay.  It's a third person shooter.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Anyways, so far, after 1 hour, the game is pretty amazing.  It's already building up its massive political story, so it should be a great time sinker.  Check it out.</p><p>Mario is also a great time sinker, but in a much different way.  The generation gap is what sets these two apart, but they are perfect examples of their genres.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Super Mario Galaxy Further thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts">Super Mario Galaxy Further thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today I made my dream come true..  I woke up early for a Sunday, curled up in a blanket and plopped myself on the couch for the better part of the day playing Super Mario Galaxy.  Sunlight peering through the blinds, everyone else asleep..  Just me, the whole rest of the day, and my game.  Quite relaxing..  and despite not getting anything remotely constructive done, it was so worth it.</p><div class='title'><b>Music</b></div><p>The music in Mario Galaxy is rather peculiar.  The game makes all attempts to be modernized and cutting edge and the music pushes what you would normally hear in a video game.  Many of the main level themes are purely orchestral and very uplifting..  The type of thing you would hear in a major film release or ballad.</p><p>These themes are majestic and inspiring...  When I enter a world that begins like this, it makes me feel like I'm playing a masterpiece..  I feel like I am the center of attention.  The music puts you on such a pedestal, that all my worldly cares disappear, and I am in the game..</p><p>Contrary to this, Mario Galaxy also features a fair amount of remixed tracks from the Nintendo and Super Nintendo Mario games..  These are mainly used in more technical and retro style levels or portions of the level.  The parts of the game that make you feel like you're playing a video game, rather than exploring the world.</p><p>Overall, though, the music is exceptional.</p><div class='title'><b>Length</b></div><p>Mario Galaxy is around the perfect length.  Currently, I have about 80 stars and 14 hours.  60 stars are required to finish the game, and I could've done that hours ago.  But, through taking my time and enjoying myself, 14 hours is probably the average time it would take.</p><p>Replay has always been great for Mario games.  The amount of hidden stars, hidden levels, and hidden other stuff makes the game twice as long.  As with previous Mario games, you need 60 stars to beat the game out of 120 stars total.</p><div class='title'><b>Star layout</b></div><p>I'm finding it extremely easy to find all the hidden stuff.  Overall, there are 15 actual levels that contain 6 stars each.  Each level lays out 3 stars for you.  Another star is hidden in one of these 3 layouts.  Beyond that you have 2 comet stars.  1 is a purple coin star, where you must collect 100 purple in the level, and the other is a 'status' effect on the world.</p><p>This status effect will be one of four different types.  Either a speed run, a race against a ghost time, or fighting a boss without getting hurt.  The game said there were 4 types, but I haven't run into any ones other than these.</p><p>After getting 10 or 15 stars, the 'status' comets will begin to appear, and after you beat the game the purple coin comets begin to appear.</p><p>The main levels of the game only account for a total of 90 stars.  Through the observatory, you'll find other one-shot levels with stars in them.  These are usually really technical platforming puzzles, or some other weird gameplay mechanic.  Large boss fights are also one-shots, which usually involve fighting Bowser or Bowser Jr.</p><p>Also, hidden throughout the game, are 3 green stars which will open up a few more one-shot worlds.  There's also a hidden red star, which will unlock Mario's flight powerup in certain levels.</p><div class='title'><b>Hidden is not so hidden</b></div><p>From the layout of the game, finding the "hidden" stuff, really isn't that difficult at all.  The game basically hands you 5 out of 6 stars on a plate and the game sometimes hints to you where the "hidden" star is in the world too.  At some point, you rescue Luigi and he goes into worlds and finds 3 of the hidden stars for you.</p><p>You still need to find the hidden star on your own, but it's really not all that difficult with the linear layout of most levels.  Just keep your eyes peeled and always take the path less traveled.  Eventually the star or the method to get the star will come clear.</p><p>I don't see the next 40 stars I need to complete the game being much trouble at all.  I haven't even gone to 5 whole worlds yet..  that's 30 stars right there.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>I would say Mario Galaxy is all that difficult..  nor would I say its too easy.  I die quite a bit in the game, but it doesn't really keep me from beating levels and killing bosses.  I usually die because I fail a challenge that the game presents me.. or I screw something up.  The game really gives you a chance to grow against the challenge rather than he hindered by it or bored by it.</p><p>I'm never really overwhelmed or underwhelmed with trying to play the game.  Of course, I'm only 66% through the full game at the moment..  The real challenges lie at the end of the game and I can't wait to try them out.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, i think Mario Galaxy is excellent.  Honestly, I don't think you could make a game that could describe excellence in video gaming better than this.  Mario Galaxy works on so many levels, and is the perfect game to reach all demographics, ages, and genders.</p><p>But..</p><p>Mario does not move me.  When I play Mario Galaxy, I feel like I, the player, am center stage..  Not Mario.  Mario is just a character, running around worlds collecting stars to save the princess.  There is no emotional attachment to anything in the game.  It's all about playing the game..  Therefore I feel like my money would be better spent on something else..</p><p>:shrugs: i dunno...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Super Mario Galaxy Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-impressions">Super Mario Galaxy Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After calling several times yesterday and today, Toys R Us finally got their copy of Super Mario Galaxy, so I went there right after work to pick up my copy.  As mentioned <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-hype" title="/super-mario-galaxy-hype">previously</a>, I choose Toys R Us as my pre-order location because they offered a $25 gift card with purchase.  To my happy surprise, not only did they offer the $25, but they also had the official pre-order bonus too!</p><p>Booya!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" /></p><p>The official pre-order bonus is a commemorative coin in a DVD sized package.  The coin isn't all that cheap either.  It feels like pewter, or something..  It has a lot of weight and mass to it though, so it's not going to fall apart.  The yellow colored in star is kind cheap though..</p><div class='title'><b>Game setup</b></div><p>I made sure Tony was home before putting the game into the Wii and beginning my journey into the star kingdom.  Before playing the game, I was instructed to update my Wii to the current firmware, which is rather interesting.</p><p>The Wii had an firmware update the other day, but I was unable to update my Wii because of networking issues.  Still unable to reach the internet, my Wii was able to update using the Super Mario Galaxy disc instead.  Is this the first Wii title to force you to upgrade to the current firmware?</p><p>This is quite similar to PSP games, which contain the most recent version of the firmware you need in order to play the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>Anyways, after upgrading and restarting, I was in.  The game begins with a fair amount of cutscenes and a hint of story.  Quite similar to Mario Sunshine, where the first 20 minutes is moving and viewing through the introduction of the game.  Once the story is set, and the rules are laid out off you go into the game.</p><p>The game laid out exactly the same as Mario 64 and Mario sunshine.  In Mario 64, you move around the castle to find levels.  In Mario Sunshine, you move around the island to find levels.  In Mario Galaxy, you move around the floaty space thingy to find levels.  On this space station are observatories you can access other galaxies which contain the stars you need to collect.</p><p>So far, the space station feels very limited compared to the Mario 64 Castle or the Mario Sunshine Island.  In the previous 2 games, there were many nooks and crannies to find hidden items, levels and stars..  but, I'm really not that far at all.  As you collect more stars in Galaxy, more parts of the space station are available.</p><p>Another thing that really bothers me about Galaxy thus far are the level layouts.  So far, each level has been incredibly linear.  You move from one floating part of the level to the next with no in-betwen.  You don't have that absolute freedom you had with Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine.  With those games you could go anywhere in the level.  With Galaxy, you can only move to places that have a warp.  It puts a damper on the whole 3D Mario theme.</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>Before touching this game, I was quite concerned with how a 3D platformer would operate with the Wii-mote.  Especially the lack of a right-analog stick which has really become the standard for operating the camera.  Also, platformers are designed for a traditional controller.  You don't need fancy motion controls when you're simply trying to move about the stage.</p><p>Besides that, the two-handed controller provides the extra amount of stability to keep the joystick steady and stationary.  A one-handed joystick without any stability makes it very difficult to move precisely where you want to.</p><p>So far, my fears have been somewhat realized.  The lack of camera controls is annoying as hell, but the floaty camera isn't too bad.  It will face in the direction you want to look at nearly all the time, and will correct itself fast enough that it doesn't piss you off.  They do provide a first-person camera view too, if you want to look around the level.</p><div class='title'><b>Annoying controls</b></div><p>Movement has been hit or miss with me.  Jumping is the number one thing you must nail down for the platforming genre.  If you can't jump and land with precision than the gameplay gets in the way of what you want to do.  You begin fighting with the game more than the challenges it presents.</p><p>When presented with Jumping puzzles in Mario Galaxy, I feel like I'm fighting with the controls about half of the time.  This is combination of problems with the camera angle and joystick angle.</p><p>In Mario Galaxy, you are moving around clusters of objects in 3D space, most of which are spherical.  Running down the side of a sphere in space won't move the camera, it'll keep itself centered on you as you begin to run around upside down.  Jumping onto enemies is a pain in the ass, when the camera doesn't give you an angle to correctly view the action.  I, generally, have to guess where the enemy will be and hope I land there.</p><p>One-handed movement is what I really dread about this game.  With a two-handed controller, it's pretty easy to know which direction is precisely left or precisely right.  With the one-handed nun-chuck, you don't have the stability and relative position of your other hand to tell your brain which way angle left is precisely 90 degrees to the left.  It's relative to the position of the C-button underneath your fore-finger.</p><p>meh...  maybe I'm just being to cynical.</p><div class='title'><b>That warm feeling</b></div><p>Despite those annoyances, it's still retains that beautiful awe feeling of a true Nintendo developed game.  Starting my game on a Tuesday night in the middle of a busy work week doesn't give Mario Galaxy justice.</p><p>After playing for 2 hours, I wish I had begun playing on a holiday, like Thanksgiving or Christmas.  A day where you have no responsibilities..  All you have is a full day and Mario in your Wii.  I could play this game for hours upon hours.</p><p>That last game that made me feel this way was Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  I began playing that game on New Years day around 8 or 9 in the morning, and I didn't put the controller down until 10pm.</p><p>It's that cheery Christmas feeling of having a beautiful, fun and massive game and all the time in the world to play it. ^_^</p><p>That's the feeling I get when playing Mario Galaxy..  Unfortunately, my weeknights are short, so I only made it through the first collection of levels at the 2 hour mark.</p><div class='title'><b>My Advice</b></div><p>If you have a Wii, definitely pick up Mario Galaxy, but don't start playing it just yet..  Through the next week, find a copy and hold on to it.  Refrain from cracking the seal until Thanksgiving Day, or the day after Thanksgiving.  Give yourself the entire day to play Mario Galaxy, because once you begin playing, you won't want to stop.</p><p>Crawl out of bed that morning in your pajamas.  Drag a blanket into the living room and just veg out all day.  Relive your days as a spunky youngster with the days off from school and no responsibilities, and play that game from dawn to dusk ^_^</p><p>That's probably what I'll be doing this coming Sunday..  unless my roommate sequesters the TV for football :/<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 - Bullet Witch" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-bullet-witch">Xbox 360 - Bullet Witch</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 13, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On a lazy Sunday afternoon, I picked a game a 360 game that I figured would be pure gold.  I remember seeing ads all over Japan last fall for Bullet Witch and I wrote it off immediately as another piece of crap Japanese action game trying to pull the Japanese in the Xbox space.</p><p>It has everything the Japanese could ask for..  1) Hot female lead character wearing scantly clad outfits, and 2) putting that character in a position of kicking ass.  The sad solemn facade of main character, Alicia draws Japanese men to the flame.  She wears all black Gothic clothes.  She is unconcerning, cool, and never smiles..  wouldn't you like to be the one to melt her heart?</p><p>The title, Bullet Witch, can easily be explained by how you kill enemies..  either with your massive gun, or using magical spells.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story</b></div><p>When you play a Japanese FPS game, you definitely aren't playing it for the gameplay..  You either play it because you like the characters and/or you like the story.</p><p>Bullet Witch takes place in the year 2013, well after most of the world's population has been killed, diseased or exterminated.  Beginning in 2004, nations began to war with each other eventually leading to nuclear and biological attacks..  50% of the world's population had died by 2010 when a devastating virus ravages another billion.  In 2012-ish, a new foe emerges on earth..  hordes of demons crawl out from the ground and begin tearing apart the human race.</p><p>The year is now 2013, and a woman in black has been seen saving humans and killing demons.</p><p>The game starts at this point..  You are given a fair amount of the world's background, but nothing is said about the character you play.  Alicia appears at a point and you begin killing zombie demons.  You have a demonic voice in your head too, but that's never explained.</p><p>As you continue to fight into the city, you meet with a group of humans resisting the demons.  Leading this group is commander Michaels, who bears a striking resemblance to Bill Raiser of Neo Contra (and other contra games) fame.</p><div class='title'><b>Level Design</b></div><p>This basic gameplay and plot devices have you running around levels and killing demons in a very arcade manor.  Hordes of enemies come running and shooting after you, and you take that down with your guns and magics.</p><p>Each stage is basically a massive arena that is split up into a linear maze thanks to Walnut Heads.    Walnut heads create a force field preventing you from advancing into further areas of your level.  They are enemies that float 20-30 feet in the air using their massive car-sized brains.  The term walnut head is coined because the brain looks like a walnut.  To kill these assholes, just fire away at them and eventually they explode into a cloud a blood and guts.</p><p>Walnut heads may seem rather weak, but there are some that use their massive brain powers to pick up cars, buses and trucks to protect themselves and attack by hurling them at you.  Directly getting hit by a flying car of fire will result in your instant death, so be careful.</p><p>Once you unravel the maze and make it to the end, sometimes you'll fight a boss.  In fact, I think they are only 2 actual boss fights in the game, out of the 6 levels.</p><div class='title'><b>B-movie-tastic!</b></div><p>What I love most about Bullet Witch is the derivative story, corny dialogue, weird enemies and ridiculous boss fights.</p><p>The giant brain floating guys are pretty wicked and seeing them erupt into splash of blood and guts is neat, but my favorite enemy are the Screamers.  Screamers look like a big pile of flesh with 5 or 6 tiny legs popping out of bottom and wearing a wig.  These fellas send out grunge spirits which will possess nearby humans and turn their bodies into ravenous, large headed freaks who quickly scurry  along the ground at you.</p><p>They first appear in the airport level where you hijack a plane in an attempt to fly to the source of evil in the country.  They aren't too difficult to kill, but if you don't kill them fast enough, all of the civilians and your army crew will be turned into bone sucking demons you can't get away from.</p><p>The airport level was really the climax of the game for me.  After killing all the walnut heads, boarding the 747, and taking off into the moonlit sky..  you are under attack!  A massive flying demon beast with a body made of eyeballs pops out from the cloud cover and is heading straight for your plane.</p><p>Alicia saves the day, but kicking open the outer hatch and climbing on to the top of the 747 at 10,000 feet in the air.  Shooting the massive beast does no damage.  The eyeballs from its body pull out of their sockets and fly through the air onto your craft.  The eyes latch onto the plane and begin eating away at its surface.</p><p>You must use your devastating lightning attack against the huge beast, while dodging and shooting off the eye balls tearing your plane apart.</p><div class='title'><b>So close..</b></div><p>This seriously rivals the cheesiness of Neo Contra, while trying to keep things in the realm of reality.  I think that's what really holds this game back, aside from its technical flaws: pisspoor gameplay, not enough enemy variety, and shotty graphics.</p><p>When fighting on the plane, I was truly enjoying myself, but I never reclaimed that joy after the plane crashed landed and I was in the jungle for nearly the rest of the game.  The final level was the exact same as the second level in the city.</p><p>In chapter 3, up on the plane, you have your massive get-a-way from the evils in civilization, but out in the woods closing in on the source, you lose that attachment to society.  You lose that post-apocolyptic thought that society is screwed... and there's no perversion of earth to show you are diving into the belly of the beast.</p><div class='title'><b>Lineage</b></div><p>While playing Bullet Witch it feels a lot like some other games I've played.  Neo Contra definitely comes to mind, also it kinda reminds me of Nightmare Creatures for Playstation.  The enemies also remind me of Doom and Quake, but there were some other bits and pieces that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  After looking up the development team, and their past works it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Before 2005, Cavia (developer of Bullet Witch) was a freelance game development company.  They made games for a variety of publishers, mostly anime licensed crap, but another game that has touched my heart..  Drag-on Dragoon, known in the states as Drakengard.</p><p>Read my impressions of Drag-on Dragoon from the past: <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions" title="/drakengard-impressions">May 22nd, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-2" title="/drakengard-impressions-2">May 27th, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-3" title="/drakengard-impressions-3">June 1st, 2004</a>, and <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-4" title="/drakengard-impressions-4">June 6th, 2004</a>.  ah, good times.  I played this game quite a bit in Platteville when I was moving out of the SPAMM haus and into 45 Bonson st.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bullet Witch doesn't reach the level of craziness Drag-on Dragoon pushed games, but it still holds some of the lineage... especially with the Screamers.</p><p>Man, that reminds me.. I still need to play Drag-on Dragoon 2..  That game is sitting in my PS2 TODO pile.</p><div class='title'><b>Content Selection: Restricted Downloadable Content</b></div><p>There's one other thing I wish to mention, and that is something I haven't seen in any other Xbox 360 game: the notion of restricted downloadable content.  Once you beat Bullet Witch, you are given a new menu option labeled Content Selection, in this menu you can download bite-size arcade levels for 25 cents each, or download new costumes for Alicia at the price of free.</p><p>You can't reach this downloadable content any other way than through this menu in the game.  You cannot go to the Xbox live marketplace to download this stuff, and you can't queue these downloads either.</p><p>Once in this menu, you click to download something and it'll pop up your xbox download hub and keep you there until whatever you are downloading is finished.  If you leave this menu, the download is instantly canceled.</p><p>There's even a little lock on the content manager when you select to download something.  Weird, huh?  I've never heard of any Xbox game do this before.</p><p>I downloaded all the costumes because why the hell not, but I may go back and pick up some of the arcade levels.  If anything, it's a good way to get rid of an extra 20 microsoft points here and there.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>Despite my praise in several segments of the game, and actually liking it quite a bit, the fact remains that this game is quite poor.  I've known an FPS to be this inaccurate and full of stupid gameplay devices try to pull it away from the FPS genre.  It's an FPS trying to be something different, and that doesn't work at all.  It's probably better to label this as an adventure game, but that's not right either.</p><p>Aside from Alicia and Bill Raiser, the graphics are sub-par.  It looks like it was originally a PS2 game, but they redid a few of the prominent models for the next-gen platform.</p><p>But I don't really care..  It's a crappy game that has some great B-movie moments.</p><p>If you found this game for $10 and didn't have anything else to spend your money on, I'd say go for it.  It's a good way to spend a lazy sunday. Ps.. I bought Bullet Witch for $20 at pre-played.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Super Mario Galaxy hype" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-hype">Super Mario Galaxy hype</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For a while there I really wasn't feeling the need to play Super Mario Galaxy, but now I'm a victim of the hype!  Whee.</p><div class='title'><b>Why don't I care?</b></div><p>I'm not really that big a fan of platforming, anymore.  I loved all the Nintendo Super Mario Brothers games, and loved the ones on the Super Nintendo.. I loved Sonic the Hedgehog as well..  but at the end of the Super Nintendo's life cycle..  Squaresoft, Enix and other RPGs had really caught my attention..</p><p>With so much time on my hands, I felt playing RPGs that lasted 40 - 60 hours with a interesting characters, a rich story, and a level building system gave me a better gaming experience than playing a single character that went level to level.  Even though the later required actual skill, I could complete the game in a matter of hours.  RPGs gave me more bang for my buck, thus were a better value.</p><p>So, I was too busy with Final Fantasy and Playstation games to really care about Mario 64 and the Nintendo 64.  Many people glorify Mario 64 as being the pivotal point in their video game history where what they thought what video games could do was completely throw out the window.</p><p>Mario 64 presented a world where you could go anywhere in the world that was presented, but I didn't really see it that way.  Mario 64 just seemed like Super Mario Brothers in 3D.  You have Goombas to jump on, blocks to break, and browser to toss into lava.  To me, it was the same paradigm in a different dimension.</p><p>It wasn't until Legend of Zelda came to the third dimension that I was absolutely blown away with what Nintendo was doing.  No other game at the time had story, exploration, and growth that was presented in Ocarina of Time.  I was completed floored.</p><p>I get why people are so excited about Mario Galaxy..  This is the next true sequel to the Mario series, and everyone has that warm feeling in their heart when they first played a Mario game and knows this feeling will resurface.</p><div class='title'><b>What do i care now?</b></div><p>I care now because this is what I've realized..  This is that boyish dream of waking up Christmas morning to find Super Mario Brothers and an NES underneath the tree and playing it continuously for the rest of the day and the day after that.  Mario really brings out that fun youthful gaming spirit inside of you that has been so dormant thanks to the Xbox.</p><p>Games are fun, imaginative, creative, colorful, and brilliant and thats what Mario has brought to gaming.  That's how Mario revitalized gaming when Nintendo launched the NES in America.  That's how Mario made the Super Nintendo the fastest adopted gaming system on the planet, until Playstation 2 a couple years later.</p><p>Mario leaves of wake of goodness and happiness the whole world can enjoy, so why not share in its glory ^_^.</p><p>Also, Toys R Us is offering a $25 gift card with the purchase of Mario Galaxy, so you're really getting it for 1/2 price..  How could I say no?</p><div class='title'><b>Victim of 1up hype</b></div><p>Well besides those reasons, Jeremy Parish and others at 1up.com have really been preaching its gospel for the past week to the point where I really want to have that great magical game experience they've been talking about.  They've hit me in 3 different ways..</p><p><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908">Retronauts podcasts, episode 31</a> with Jeremy Parish, Scott Sharky, Shane Bettenhausen, Andrew Pfister and Chris Kohler talking about the Nintendo Super Mario Brothers titles, how they felt when first exposed, and how the 3 3D super mario games draw parallels to the first 3 2D marios.</p><p>Jeremy Parish continues with his <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3164124&sec=REVIEWS" title="http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3164124&sec=REVIEWS">premiere review</a> on Super Mario Galaxy.  It's a very fresh review that really doesn't go into specifics but conveys the groundwork for a ground breaking game.  His review portreys Mario Galaxy as an instant classic that redefines the platforming genre.</p><p>Parish continues, yet again, with a featured spot on <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3145462" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3145462">The 1up Show</a>.  The middle section is all about Mario Galaxy, with Parish gushing about specifics of the game, along with Shane Bettenhausen and Dan Hsu.  The skits of Parish anxiously waiting for his copy in the mail are hilarious.  Especially when he finally receives it. ^_^</p><p>I'm quite a fan of Parish's work, his podcast and his art, so constantly hearing him talk about this game with such high praise, really drives the point home with me.</p><div class='title'><b>One week!</b></div><p>So today, I pre-ordered my copy at Toys R Us and will probably be there Monday morning when the game releases to ensure my copy and my $25 gift card.  I'll probably hold on to the card for a while until Ghost Squad or Resident Evil Chronicles becomes cheap, or hell.. maybe i'll pick up Zach & Wiki.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Final Fantasy Tactics Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/final-fantasy-tactics-impressions">Final Fantasy Tactics Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 2, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Friday, when I picked up Freaks and Geeks, Pre-played also had a copy of Final Fantasy Tactics for a mere $30.  $10 cheaper than MSRP was a good enough deal for me as I plucked the case off the shelf and proceeded to the register.</p><p>The next morning I closed to book on Gurumin, and began my adventures in the infant land of Ivalice.</p><div class='title'><b>History</b></div><p>Originally released on the Playstation in February 1998 in the US, gamers flocked to this game thanks to the Final Fantasy brand.  Sales were pretty good thanks to Final Fantasy 7's release 5 months prior, but didn't sell as well.  It sold a million copies, but eventually diminished off shelves and became fairly difficult to find.</p><p>I picked up my own copy the day it came out along with my pal, Justin.  Working in the video games section of Toys R Us in those days, made it very easy to get my hands on any video game that was released.  I just needed to set it aside when the shipment came in..  The same type of thing we did with Action Figures when uploading trucks.</p><p>I played the crap out of the game.  I got all the secret characters, beat all the secret dungeons and levels..  I loved this game quite a bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Quality</b></div><p>What puts Final Fantasy Tactics on such a pedestal is its fairly simple and well-balanced gameplay.  Few Strategy RPGs have been so much fun and challenging at the same time.  Even its sequel, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance couldn't even live up to the original.</p><p>The musical score and art style are what really kept me in the game.  The music is wonderfully orchestrated, and the character art is very old-world european.  It feels like you're playing an instant classical masterpiece.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>I sometimes wonder how so many people like this game when the first 3 or 4 battles beat the crap out of you.  When I first played the game back in 1998, I took me several attempts to complete the 3 battle in the game.  This is the battle in the town with the archers picking you off one by one.  It's really interesting that the same problems I had starting off with the game in 1998, are the same problems I'm having today in 2007.  Those goddamn archers..</p><p>So..  either Final Fantasy Tactics difficultly and challenge has stood the test of time, or my skill as a Strategy RPG gamer hasn't improved in 9 years.  :shrugs:  I played through Disgaea, Phantom Brave and La Pucelle without a problem, so I can't be too bad..  even though, those are level grinders.</p><div class='title'><b>Strategy</b></div><p>Those first couple of battles are annoying, but once you've gotten your feet wet and begin diving into the job system, you'll find yourself in heaven learning more skills and finding new strategic ways to implement them on the battle field.</p><p>Through playing the game previously, my best strategy consistently killing everyone on the battle field in two turns was having two Mathematicians with 1st turn and Holy.  Everyone else on my team had that armor that would absorb the Holy spell, so my Mathematicians would cast the spell on the entire battle field one after the other.</p><div class='title'><b>Differences between Playstation 1 and PSP</b></div><p>Squaresoft added a couple new goodies to the PSP version.  There are one or two new hidden characters along with all the original hidden characters.  There are multiple player maps you can play with or against a friend.  There are two new Job classes: Onion Knight, and Dark Knight.  (and) There are some cutscenes mixed into the game and pivotal moments.</p><p>The cutscenes are quite beautiful and stick with the original art style beautifully.</p><p>Another change is a complete re-translation/localization of the entire game.  Instead of goofy dialogue and an unintelligible story, you can actually follow along with the plot and figure out what's going on.  The dialogue is in "ye old English" style, much like Final Fantasy XII, which continues consistency throughout Squaresoft's Ivalice properties.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Anyways, starting off Final Fantasy Tactics can be a little rough, but once you learn the Job and Skill trees, you'll have a lot of fun.  I haven't gotten a chance to play any multiplayer, but I probably will in the next week or so.  I'm still a little bit behind Tony, so I want to catch up. ^_^</p><p>If you're a fan of Final Fantasy or Strategy RPGs, definitely pick it up..  Though, $40 is kind of expensive for a 9 year old game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Phantasmagoria" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/phantasmagoria">Phantasmagoria</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 31, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today marked the second time in two weeks that Destructoid had an article about Phantasmagoria cross its front pages.  Is there some Roberta Williams rival going on that I don't know about?  I guess with the release of Manhunt 2, they're trying to pull in similarities since Phantasmagoria is one of the goriest games to ever be released.</p><p>What better day than Halloween for me to write about it as well. ^_^</p><p>Here are the two articles, complete with youtube videos..<br/><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/phantasmagoria-makes-murder-look-as-sexy-as-it-was-in-the-old-days-49210.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/phantasmagoria-makes-murder-look-as-sexy-as-it-was-in-the-old-days-49210.phtml">Article #1: Phantasmagoria makes murder sexy</a><br/><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/why-phantasmagoria-is-awesome-and-why-it-could-never-be-released-today--52024.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/why-phantasmagoria-is-awesome-and-why-it-could-never-be-released-today--52024.phtml">Article #2: Why phantasmagoria would never be released today</a></p><p>Looking at the "gore" and murder today is far more comical than horrific, like it was supposed to be back in the day.  A lot of these murders are more submissive and sexual given a man overpowering a woman and killing her in bizarre methods..</p><div class='title'><b>Nostalgia</b></div><p>My first brush with Phantasmagoria was at a relative's house.  They had it on their computer along with Sim City 2000 and a couple other games.  I was playing Sim City for a little while and noticed Phantasmagoria and wanted to play it.  They gave me the 'ol.. "No no.. this game is for adults" speech.  O_o..  I really wasn't THAT young at this point in time..  I guess they didn't want to get in trouble with my parents or something..</p><p>Later on in the week, I asked my Dad if he'd buy me the game and a day or two later, huzzah!  Phantasmagoria for the Macintosh Power PC was mine!  Next time I'm home, I really need to search around for that game..  It's gotta be somewhere..  even though, it wouldn't be able to run on anything these days.  (at least, nothing i own)</p><p>The game was 7 discs: one for each chapter.  It reminded me a lot of my Sega CD games, like Sewer Shark and Texas Ground Zero.  Nothing but Full Motion Video mixed in with gameplay elements..</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>Unfortunately, I didn't get very far in the game.  I completed disc 1, but nothing interesting really happened..  I got a little bit into disc 2, but got stuck and didn't know what to do..  It seemed kinda boring..  I popped in the other discs to see if I could watch the FMV or something, but I actually found something much more useful..  You could begin any chapter you wanted with finishing those before it.  Keen!</p><p>I immediately went to disc 7 to try and beat the game.  Disc 7 really had no exploring at all.  You husband, Don, was completely possessed by the ghost in the mansion, and you're running for you life.  You find a couple items while trying to escape but eventually get caught.</p><p>You wake up from unconsciousness to find Don strapping you into a killing machine.  With the items you have on you, you must escape his clutches.  Apparently, you're supposed to distract him, escape from the chair, and seal the evil vortex in the basement.  I could never do it correctly..  whatever item combination I was supposed to use, I either didn't have or it was not obvious.</p><p>I found a hammer earlier, so I beat Don over the head with it. That certainly distracted him long enough for me to escape the chair before it sliced my head in two..  but then I run down to the basement and I'm giving one chance to do something about this vortex.  All I have is a fricken hammer..  I must've missed something on the way..  Oh well, too late.. the demon came out of the vortex and tore my face off.</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>I'd love to go back and play through the whole game, even though it is horribly dated.  I never played any of the Kings Quest or Police Quest games, so this is really my only connection to Roberta Williams..</p><p>These games had really died off thanks to the advancement of modern gaming.  Between gameplay and graphics, story telling on par with motion pictures never really came into the picture.  These days, every single game involves some type of story presented in a very cinematic way.  If your game doesn't have a story, then it's crap.</p><p>The only adventure games you can find these days are on platforms that haven't become graphically intense enough to match modern console gaming..  like the Flash Player and Nintendo DS.  Phoenix Wright and Touch Detective are king on the DS for this reason, but are still over looked because "it's like reading a book."  Their console counterparts are much more alluring.  You want to play the story, not Choose-your-own-adventure.</p><p>After Phantasmagoria, Williams made one more King's Quest game and then effectively retired from gaming in 1998.  Nearly a decade has past, but her games still live on in gamers.  Especially Destructoid writers ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/19">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/17">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
