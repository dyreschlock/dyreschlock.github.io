| October 25, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My retro gaming hardware collection has grown recently. The Analogue Pocket introduced me into a gaming platform possible of playing decades of games across dozens of consoles, handhelds, and arcade boards. Recently, I got a Mister which expanded this reach even further.</p><p>Last year, <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">I made a page</a> that catalogued all of the notable games I had on my Analogue Pocket. And now I've revamped that curated list into an overall Digital Retro Game Library. This lists all the notable games I have available on both the Pocket and the Mister. More platforms may be added in the future, like PS2 and Gamecube.</p><p><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><b>Digital Retro Game Library</b></a></p><p class='img'><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playlists</b></div><p>Originally, these games were being collected to build Genre lists of games using the now-canceled Playlist feature for the Analogue Pocket. The idea was that I could scroll through a Genre of games and choose one to play without having to pay attention to the hardware platform it was designed for. I was collecting all this information using <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-utils" title="/analogue-pocket-utils">Pocket Utils</a>, a collection of Java programs that I wrote to manage games and stuff on my Pocket.</p><p>Later, after the Playlist feature was buried and gone, I decided to put all of this information into a webpage so I could at least see everything visually. This was the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">Pocket Curated Games</a> page, the first iteration of this project.</p><p>Later again and recently, I got a Mister. The Mister is the premiere FPGA gaming platform, and the Analogue Pocket is a handheld FPGA device. FPGA cores are written for specific hardware, so there are advantages to both platforms, although the Mister can generally handle more complicated systems and it's open source. Because of this, people have built several features and accessories on top of the platform. One thing implemented a couple years ago was Shortcuts. Rather than turning on a core and choosing a game, you could choose a game directly from the main menu. This is exactly like how I wanted Playlists to work on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>So, by updating the programs in Pocket Utils to look for Mister games, I could add all that information in the database. And writing a new program, I could automatically make shortcuts to all the games I have managed in my database, essentially creating all the Playlists I wanted from the beginning.</p><p>The Pocket Curated Page being revamped into the Digital Retro Game Library now shows all those games, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Launching Games</b></div><p>There's another really nice feature available on the Mister called TapTo. TapTo is a service that runs in the background on Mister and accepts game executing commands. The main idea for this feature was to bring back physicality to the Mister, which is a sole digital platform. Using a physical NFC reader you can "tap" a physical NFC card (or anything with an NFC signal) and it will automatically launch the game associated with it.</p><p>I'm not interested in having a huge collection of cards for individual games. But, I was very interested in TapTo's feature of launching RANDOM games. By sorting all of my shortcuts to games in Genre folders, I could launch a random Shooter or random Fighter.</p><p>Earlier this year, the TapTo service was upgraded to accept network requests. Any device connected to the same Wifi network could send a command to TapTo and it'll execute it. They launched a phone app that took advantage of this, but the request service is wide open. Anything can send commands.</p><p>So, combining yet another project with this, I added functionality in my chat bot, <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a>, to accept requests to launch random games from my Genres. With Pocket Utils updated to manage my Mister games, Schlock Bot can read this information too, and launch individual games.</p><p><pre>!game Shooter<br/>!game Panzer Dragoon (Saturn)</pre></p><p>These commands can be typed in my Discord and read by Schlock Bot.</p><div class='title'><b>Going Further</b></div><p>One annoying thing about typing in games to launch in Discord is that you have to type them correctly. Dr. Mario has a period in it, so if you type Dr Mario, it won't find the game. Also, I have a Gameboy Color version of Dr. Mario, too, so which one do you want? You need to be annoyingly specific.</p><p>So, using the Digital Game Library, you can click on a game, it'll write that execution command in Discord, Schlock Bot will read the command (if it's running), and then launch the game on Mister (if that's running too).</p><p>As such, the Digital Retro Game Library not only shows all my available games, but it's also a method of selecting games to play on the Mister.</p><p>There's a lot of moving parts in between clicking a game and it launching on the Mister. It would be a lot better if the webpage sent the request to Schlock Bot directly. But, this janky thing works for the time being. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Additions</b></div><p>Getting back to the Library, prior to getting a Mister, I set up a Playstation 2 with a game server to play all of those classic games. I made an <a href="/old/v7/playstation-2-game-inventory" title="/playstation-2-game-inventory">inventory</a> page that shows all of those games, but I'm thinking about adding them in this library, too. Also, I may mod a gamecube in the future to play a library of those games. I will want to have a library of those games listed somewhere, so adding them here or on the PS2 inventory page makes sense.</p><p>In addition to more games, I was thinking of putting download links to my save files for each game, too. I'm already doing this on the PS2 Game Inventory page with memory cards.</p><p>We'll see. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Callisto Protocol" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

You're carrying some medical supplies from the prison on Callisto to Europa, both moons of Jupiter. But, shit goes wrong when terrorists responsible for a biological attack on Europa board your ship, attack you, and ultimately send your vessel back into Callisto's atmosphere, and crash on the surface.</p><p>You survive the crash, but your copilot is dead. All members of the terror group are dead, except one. As the moon's guards discover the crash and find you, both of you are taken to the prison. </p><p>Things get even worse when the pathogen from the biological attack spreads in the prison mutating many of the inmates into deranged violent abominations. The prison begins the fall apart allowing you to mount an escape.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is how the story of Callisto Protocol begins. You are Jacob Lee, who's just a normal dude put into extreme circumstances. On the surface, it seems like a pretty standard action adventure game with an involved story and twists here and there. But, this game ends up living in the shadow of another, which dominates the conversation. </p><div class='title'><b>Derivative</b></div><p>As much as Callisto Protocol may want to stand on its own, it's hard to talk about it without talking about <a href="/old/v7/dead-space" title="/dead-space">Dead Space</a>. Callisto Protocol comes from one of the original creators of Dead Space, and has some members of the old team, too. Callisto tries its best to emulate what made Dead Space so great, but fails on almost every front. It takes some cues from <a href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us-part-2" title="/the-last-of-us-part-2">Last of Us</a> as well, but it feels like a rip-off.</p><div class='title'><b>Enemies and Combat</b></div><p>Oh, we be fighting zombies again.</p><p>Both Dead Space and Last of Us have zombies and while the high points of both those games go far behind their enemy designs, the enemies are still interesting. The necromorphs in Dead Space had a very dynamic design that supported the combat. The infected in Last of Us were detailed enough that you could see how the fungal infection grew and mutated their bodies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yep, that's a zombie. In Callisto, the biophages just look like dudes with skin problems. Later, you fight some others that look like Clickers from Last of Us. And then you fight deaf zombies EXACTLY like Clickers from Last of Us.</p><p>One departure from Dead Space is that Callisto isn't a shooter first, but a brawler. You bob and weave incoming attacks and counter with a melee weapon, so it makes sense the zombies are more like crazed humans. But now we're doing Arkham Batman combat, and Arkham Batman combat was not this stiff. Batman combat was designed around fighting multiple enemies at once, and you could react to them working together.</p><p>Callisto often struggles with this. Every attack has weight to it, but that weight often pushes you into a position you don't want. Other enemies then attack or you get stuck in a corner looking the wrong direction. It hard to tell where enemies are coming from if they aren't in front of you. Jacob isn't nimble enough to run around and take out enemies, so you always have to focus on them one-at-a-time, which slows down the game.</p><p>And you're already moving pretty slow. In Dead Space, Isaac's slow movement made sense because you're moving around in a 200lbs suit meant for protection from environmental and occupational hazards. You're like a tank. In Callisto, you're only wearing a cloth prison jump suit. Jacob isn't some huge muscle dude, either. He looks like he could sprint down a hall way and slip past a group of people. Later, you get an EVA suit, but it looks flexible enough to move easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Environment and Immersion</b></div><p>One of the key points of Dead Space was its immersive environment supported by the heavy futuristic machinery, dynamic lighting and color, and a sharp distinct and unique set of sounds that overwhelmed you. Incorporating all of the HUD and UI elements into the character and environment made you feel immersed in the world.</p><p>Last of Us had a similar approach. There were still some UI elements that assisted the player through exploration and combat, but the lack of music and use of silence matched with the vibrant lush overgrown environments which immersed me in the exploration of Seattle and listening for the subtle movements of enemies around blind corners.</p><p>Both games felt designed around the opportunity to give creative people a chance to make the most of their opportunities, and create dynamic and memorable experiences. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Callisto has some unique areas, but the first half of the game is moving through drab metal hallways and then the prison's sewer system. Lots of pipes and moving through vents. The arboretum is a nice area, but it's dark and muddy. Later, you visit an old mining area. The density of buildings and their layout is interesting, but the buildings themselves aren't very interesting. The environments are definitely detailed, but they don't really inspire creativity in me. It feels too restrictive.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest flop of Callisto is its lack of dynamic sound. There's no unique sound of heavy machinery working. There's no sharp crack of gun fire or welding tools. There's no use of silence to accent the enemies movements. And overall, the music is pretty generic and used too frequently. There are no surprises or memorable experiences through sound, which dampens the overall experience.</p><p>Thankfully, the monotony is broken up by breaking out onto the surface of Callisto. You put on an EVA and are shot out into the environment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow is pushed around by your foot steps and moving gates. While trying to find your way to the space depot, the blizzard often overwhelms your vision. At least now, Jacob's slow lumbering movements make sense. If Jacob could move faster or more dynamically, I would've loved to stay outside longer, but everything just seems to weigh down the experience that I want to move on to the next section as quick as possible.</p><p>In the end, we get another unique area, the clean living area of the administration.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The game could've used more unique areas like this. But, we're in a prison and we're climbing through sewers and mines. There aren't many opportunities to have fantastical elements while making the setting down-to-earth. Perhaps Callisto Protocol tries to bring too much reality to its setting. As a result, all of the edges feel sanded off.</p><div class='title'><b>What a Twist!</b></div><p>Through attempting to escape, you journey into the depths of Callisto to an abandoned mining colony from 75 years ago, and discover the truth of the biophage outbreak. Can you guess?</p><p>Oh, it turns out the government was behind the biophage attack on Europa, not the terrorists. And the terrorists were people caught up in the attack who blamed the government. The reason you were caught up in everything, too, was because the medical supplies you transported to Europa were hiding the viral agent that started the outbreak.</p><p>75 years ago, the first outbreak occurred in this mining colony as the scientists responsible for the biophage tested their progress. Once the outbreak was concealed, the prison was built on top of it to continue testing the biophage virus on inmates.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was aliens all along. The miners had discovered the corpse of a massive alien and studied its secrets. The government agency funding this science believed the larvae of the alien could help human ascend to the next level of evolution allowing them to expand within the universe further. The biophage virus was the result of their research, and injecting humans was meant to make them impervious to the harsh environment of space. But, whatdya know, it just turned them into monsters.</p><p>The Callisto Protocol is the development of this biophage to push humanity to the next level of evolution, and its eventually release and conversion of all humanity.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They got pretty close making an evolved human with this guy. But eventually he also turns into a mindless monster and you gotta shoot him in the face anyway. With their prime experiment defeated, the government (actually a crazed religious group) sets the prison to self-destruct. With only one escape pod available, you shove your friend into it and she escapes along with records of the event and a sample of the virus.</p><p>You are still stuck on the planet and the game ends as the monster jumps at you. No real ending, just a few words and cut to black.</p><div class='title'><b>Continued in DLC</b></div><p>In the $15 DLC, the story continues. You wake up with the doctor speaking to your through an earpiece. Get up! There are more secrets to be had! You travel to her lab and her hologram explains about the further experiments and atrocities. There was a competing experiment being held to push humans to the next stage of evolution. And you find out that the doctor led the project.</p><p>You stumble further down into her lab into far more interesting, detailed, and amazing looking areas than the main game. Areas use a lot of orange light to break away from the boring metal blue walls and floors. Bio-matter spreads and grows from the walls transforming it into an alien or infested looking environment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It is often difficult to tell whether something is going to come out of the wall to get you, or whether danger is just around the corner. The terrible "mood" music and jump scares are turned down and used in actual appropriate moments compared to the main game.</p><p>Sanity effects are now used, too, as it feels like Jacob is slowing falling apart mentally. You open up a treasure chest to receive nothing, and turn around to find the chest in front of you again, but unopened. You move down a hallway as enemies continuously attack you, not realizing the path forward is to turn around.</p><div class='title'><b>A New Enemy</b></div><p>Something new appears in the depths of the labs.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The prison bots from before have been infected and fused with bio-matter making them stronger and more aggressive than before. It's still not too difficult to dodge out of the way and slam them with your electrified police baton, though.</p><p>However, as you enter the laboratory in the police bot factory, your baton is destroyed after beating a bot over and over again to its death. Your main weapon used throughout the entire game and a fundamental staple of how the game play works is removed from your arsenal. You can no longer easily dodge and counter enemies. The brawler has turned into a clumsy shooter.</p><p>It's not long before you are chased into a test room with bots closing in on all of your sides when you obtain the best funnest weapon in the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hammer replaces your police baton and smashes through bots after a few hits. Zombies from before are cut through like butter. Up until this point, the whole game felt like you're fighting against the gameplay. Eventually you find a rhythm that works, but it ends up becoming a single use solution to every encounter. Now you feel incredible and powerful by slicing and smashing through everything that sucked about the game before.</p><div class='title'><b>The Reason</b></div><p>As mentioned earlier, the Callisto Protocol is the development of the biophage to push humanity into the next stage of evolution. Their main plan ended up turning people into zombie monsters.</p><p>The doctor had a different idea and tried to compete with them. The doctor created these bio-bots as her solution to humanity's evolution. The bots were fused with human skin, muscles, and brain using the alien biophage material. Human consciousness was then uploaded into the bots for humanity to live on forever.</p><p>It didn't work. Just like the zombies, the bots became mindless machines of destruction and ripped apart anything that was human, relying too much on the prison's programming.</p><div class='title'><b>The Ending</b></div><p>The doctor had been luring you further into the depths of the lab to reach an escape pod she had prepared for herself. As you arrive near the hatch, the doctor is grabbed by a robot. The bot infects and mutates the doctor into an abomination that you juke, jive, and smash until it's dead. With the doctor's voice still in your ear, you proceed to the escape pod.</p><p>The escape pod is your ship, though. It's your destroyed ship that crashed into Callisto in the beginning. The doctor directs you to hop on the controls and get out of there. You escape the prison, escape the moon. You continue to fly as far away as fast as you can. And space begins to light up. The light gets brighter and brighter to point where you can't see anything but white.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's done. You're done. You're dead. You've been dead this whole time.</p><p>As your friend had escaped earlier with all the lab's data, you were killed as the enemies closed in. The doctor found your body, and ignited the few remaining sparks in your brain. The doctor used the implant in your head linked to your friend in order to send the remaining data she had exposing the government's horrific projects on Callisto, and her involvement in the project.</p><p>It felt like the DLC was going to give some full closure to the ending. And I suppose it did. Callisto Protocol no longer ends on a cliffhanger. But, it's not a happy ending and it completely closes the book on Jacob's story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Real Life Ending</b></div><p>Most people feel cheated by the ending, and further cheated by paying $15 to get an ending that punches them in the face.</p><p>The publisher ultimately is to blame for the abrupt ending and pay-per-view ending. Krafton cut the development time towards the end of the project and forced the release date ahead of schedule. New enemy types were scrapped from the game, and the ending had to be reworked into what we got. It's pretty obvious that some of those scrapped ideas were remolded into the DLC ending.</p><p>It's poetic and perhaps intentional that the final scene is of Jacob's horrific torn-apart corpse, a signal from the developer that there is no future for this game, and a metaphor of what the developers perhaps consider the result of their ideas and hard work after the publisher forced their hand.</p><p>It sucks even more that after the release of the DLC, the developer laid off employees as the publisher realigned the focus of the studio.</p><p>I think it's easy to say Callisto Protocol is kinda lame and not all that great, but I think the DLC shows that this game and its developer had the potential to make something better and more compelling than what we got. Not everyone gets a blank check, though. And very few publishers want to take a risk. Everything has to be a financial hit these days. There's no longer any room for mediocrity even if it has some kernels of something good.</p><p>Anyways, I'm glad I played it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokemon Fossil Museum in Gifu" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokemon-fossil-museum-in-gifu">Pokemon Fossil Museum in Gifu</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Ishimura is a massive mining starship in orbit above the planet Aegis VII, and the distress call was the last communication with anyone on board. Among the Kellion's sparse crew is Isaac Clarke, an engineer.</p><p>As Clarke and the Kellion crew board the derelict malfunctioning ship, they are attacked by transformed mutated members of the crew, known as Necromorphs. The Kellion is destroyed, and Clarke and a few other members of the Kellion begin to explore and repair the Ishimura in order to escape and find out what happened to the crew. Isaac dons his heavy duty repair suit with iconic welding helmet, an overall staple of the Dead Space series.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Dead Space is a survival horror game with heavy inspirations from Resident Evil 4 and Event Horizon. Originally released in 2008, Dead Space become one of the genres best examples of survival horror done right, but eventually the series fizzled out as it became more action oriented, which was reason enough for Electronic Arts to shut down the developer's studio. </p><p>Thankfully, EA Motive, the developers of this 2023 remake, insisted that this new game stick closely to its 2008 original, which I consider the best in the series.</p><div class='title'><b>Immersion</b></div><p>Dead Space was unique upon release as one of its strict design ideas was using absolutely no HUD. All ammo, health, and menus are displayed within the universe of the characters, as if the character themselves are looking at and using those displays. All button prompts appear on the objects in the environment. If a menu appears, it comes from Isaac's computer Rig on his wrist, and he looks at it when you select menu items.</p><p>Although, the true crown of Dead Space's immersion is the Audio. The Ishimura is a very dense, heavy, mining vessel. All the different areas have their thick heavy machines, and these machines are all distinct and loud. Often when you enter a new area, you become completely overwhelmed by the sounds of the machinery.</p><p>One of my favorite areas in the original was Engineering. As you kickstarted the engines, the overall sound was so loud you couldn't hear any enemies or footsteps or menu movements. It was a constant blast of sound until you exited the room. This area still exists in the remake, but they moved it into a corridor instead of the overall room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Isaac is really just a repairman, and all of your weapons futuristic versions of welders, strippers, nail guns, and such. All of these guns have very powerful and electrical cracks and bursts that you may hear at a futuristic construction site. All these sounds feel like they split your ears as you rip apart the space zombies. With your heavy, 200lbs armored suit, you can also stomp them into the ground with a satisfying crunch.</p><p>Everything in the environment and everything you do comes with a heavy mechanical organic weight to it. It's criminal if you don't play this game with headphones turned up to 11.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, one of the most impactful and immersive sequences is the first time you open a door, and all of the air and sound get blasted into space from a violent hull breach. Your suit's boots are magnetized so space walking is no problem, but the first time you get thrust into space feels like going over the top of a rollercoaster. It feels like part of your own breath was sucked into space, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Haunted House</b></div><p>As you continue to explore and repair the Ishimura, you move into new areas of the ship with new monsters. Often you'll reach a place of relatively quiet, only for a monster to SCREAM at you as it burst out of the ceiling or a nearby wall. This happens pretty often. As the game's sound fully immerses you in the environment, it tends to employ startling scare tactics.</p><p>You get pretty powerful later on in the game, so when a standard zombie pops out of the wall, you can quick shoot it or bash it into the ground. Even when a bunch of zombies come at you at once, you can usually take them all at once with your arsenal. So, many of these sequences turn into a corner of a haunted house. Boo!</p><p>But, the first time you fight a Brute can make you feel powerless. A brute is a gigantic zombie about the size of a car. When it comes rushing towards me and my gunfire has absolutely no effect, my next instinct is to run! But then the heavy suit makes it feel like you're trying to run in water, and its huge stomping lumbering movements are right on your heels. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are some genuine fearful movements as you try to evade death, but ultimately, you can overcome these moments by trying again after you die. Later on, you learn about the best ways of killing things by fighting the zombies over and over again.</p><div class='title'><b>Retro</b></div><p>People generally define retro games as anything made over 10 years ago. This was an easy statement to make in the PS3/360 era of gaming, as each new console had some genuine easy-to-see graphical and design improvements over the previous generation. For example, Super Mario World and Super Mario Sunshine were 11 years apart, and the difference between those games of the same series is absolutely massive. The jump from 2D to 3D was huge, but so is the idea of having to explore the world to find levels, having a more involved story with characters having motivations, and talking with characters to find more things.</p><p>The time difference between the original Dead Space and this remake is 15 years, and the overall game hasn't really changed at all. The graphics have been modernized, and load times reduced because of current generation hardware. A few quality of life features added for smoother gameplay. Isaac talks now and involves himself in the story, too. But it's still the exact same game that I remember from the Playstation 3.</p><p>Are games from the PS3/360 era really retro if their game design still fits within the modern era of game design?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe some people consider games retro if they center on a single player experience. Most modern games today have some kind of social element, so you can share the experience with friends. Or they include some kind of open world experience, so it can feel like the game is endless and you can play for hours and hours.</p><p>Dead Space is a pretty tight 12 hour game, and adding any of those modern engagement traps would ruin the experience. But, at the same time, once you finish the game (and finish it a second time), you're pretty much done with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>After the original Dead Space, the studio became known as Visceral Games and made Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3, as well as Dead Space Extraction (a light gun game), and some novels and comics. Dead Space 2 was another high for the series, but I think there was never enough lore and story to carry it to a full never-ending franchise. Dead Space 2 started the series into something more action-oriented to appeal to a general audience, and Dead Space 3 killed the franchise and the developer.</p><p>The creator of Dead Space had actually left Visceral before Dead Space 2, and recently he helmed the creation of a new game, <a href="/old/v7/the-callisto-protocol" title="/the-callisto-protocol">Callisto Protocol</a> released in 2022, which seems like an actual new Dead Space game in all but name. It's either ironic or malicious that EA came along with the Dead Space remake at the same time the original creator made a new one himself. However much of Visceral's former staff work at Motive and were key developers bringing this remake to life.</p><p>The Dead Space remake does an absolutely excellent job of sticking to the original but adding a few new things and changing others to make it even better. This remake doesn't really feel like a cash-grab. It feels like the people working on it genuinely cared about Dead Space and wanted to bring it back.</p><p>Unfortunately, it really sucks that the remake did not meet the sales EA was hoping for.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Through killing space zombies and finding some survivors, Isaac uncovers the truth of what happened on the Ishimura. Members of the crew became obsessed and possessed by the religion of Unitology, which revolves around an artifact found of Aegis VII, known as The Marker. The Marker slowly morphed the colonists of Aegis VII into the Necromorphs, which attacked and infected the crew of the Ishimura.</p><p>On the surface of Aegis VII is the Hive Mind, which controls all Necromorphs. In order to pacify and destroy it, Isaac brings the Marker back to the surface of Aegis VII. There are several other twists and turns along the way as Isaac is betrayed by his crew, and caught between the motives of Earth and the Church of Unitology. </p><p>In the end, it turns out that his love interest that he's been chasing the whole game killed herself prior to the Kellion arriving at the Ishimura. He's essentially been chasing a ghost through manipulation of the Marker and an Ishimura survivor.

It is advertised as "the last memory card you'll ever need." It works for both Playstation 1 and Playstation 2, and it stores all of its data for memory on an SD card. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After putting together my <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2 set up</a>, I wanted some way of being able to backup all of my save data from my decade of playing the Playstation 1 and 2. Having a memory card that uses an SD card was what I wanted, and I found this.</p><p>But, it does MUCH more than just store save files on an SD card. It has a paging system, so you can easily create a new card with the press of a button. It identifies games with Game Id, so it can create unique memory cards for each game. And the card has Wifi, so all of its functions can be controlled by a web interface!</p><div class='title'><b>Updating</b></div><p>Before doing anything, you need an SD card. Each PS2 memory card is 8mb so even having an SD card with 128gb of space is massive over kill. I bought a 64gb Samsung card for around $10 since it seemed to be the cheapest option. 32gb cards were available, but they were around the same price. May as well get a slightly large one. The SD card must be formatted either FAT32 or ExFat. I went with ExFat.</p><p>With the card ready to go, the next necessary step is firmware. You should update to the most recent version for access to all of the current features. Here's the link to the firmware:<br/><a href="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public" title="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public">Latest Firmware Download</a></p><p>Put the SD card in the MemCard and put the MemCard in the PS2. Power it on, and it'll start updating. When finished, it is ready to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Wi-Fi</b></div><p>You may think that Wi-Fi is unnecessary for a memory card, but you have so many more methods of control than being limited to the 2-button, small screen interface attached to the PS2. When you want to change card, you can easily do it with a scroll and a click in a web browser.</p><p>Setting up the Wi-Fi has a few steps that are pretty easy. First, you need to hold down the Left button and release to enter the Menu. Click down to Wi-Fi and select it. You'll be given an IP address. Now, the memcard pro is broadcasting as an access point. It wants you to connect to the access point and visit the webpage at that IP address. Going to that IP address will open a webpage to complete the Wi-Fi set up.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In the Setup Wizard, you'll choose a Wi-Fi network to connect to.

You can further set up which memory card should be selected by default when the console powers up. And, you can set up cloud backup with Google Drive. You can also update the firmware from here, too, rather than doing it manually.</p><div class='title'><b>Save Management</b></div><p>One of the best features of the Memcard is identifying games using Game_Id. Every disc printed and created for a Playstation 1 and 2 has a unique Game_Id associated with it and the Memcard can identify this ID and automatically create or switch to a virtual memory card used only for that game. It does this by default, but you can change this behavior in the settings.</p><p>That means that you don't need to worry about trying to find which cards have which saves. You also don't have to worry about space on a card because other games won't be there to fill the space. And, even if you do save a lot in one game and use up all of the space, you can create a new page and have up to 8 memory cards for each game.</p><p>All memory cards are stored as virtual drives in the <code>mcd</code> format on the SD card. Unfortunately, you can't modify the contents of the card directly on a PC. So, if you want to add stuff on the card directly, you still need to use uLaunchELF on the PS2.</p><p>There might be something out there that will mount of the drive and give you access because people have written scripts and programs that access the contents of the cards for Save Splitting. But, I haven't found anything yet. Save Splitting is useful when moving the contents of your current memory card stash into the Memcard.</p><div class='title'><b>Transferring Old Memory Cards</b></div><p>I have an old plastic bag full of memory cards from the late 90s and 2000s. The bulk of these are Playstation 1 cards, but there are some Playstation 2 cards, too. As well as Dreamcast, N64, and Gamecube.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In total, I have eleven Playstation 1 cards, a Pocketstation, and six Playstation 2 cards. I want to move all of this data onto my SD card. It'd be nice if the Memcard Pro2 had an option to copy a Memory Card directly, but we have to copy over everything manually. From there, we have to use Save Splitting programs to separate and sort all of the saves into their own memory cards.</p><p>Overall, this is a 2-step process for both Playstation 1 and 2, and the first step is identical for both: we need to manually transfer all Memory Card saves from one memory card to another. This is normally done using the Playstation browser, and I think it's the fastest method for Playstation 1. But for Playstation 2, it's much faster to use uLaunchELF and move all of the file contents.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>With uLaunchELF, <code>mc0</code> is the memory card is slot 1, and <code>mc1</code> is slot 2. Mark everything you want to copy with the X button, hit R1 for the menu, and select copy. Navigate to the other memory card location, hit R1 for the menu again, and select paste. Everything you selected will be copied. uLaunchELF didn't refresh when I unplugged and changed memory cards, so I had to restart uLaunchELF each time.  It's still MUCH faster than loading PS2 saves in the Browser, though.</p><p>With all the cards copied as Virtual memory cards, we want to break out all the saves into all of their unique cards for each game.</p><p>All of the save splitting stuff I learned from <b>Archades Games</b> on YouTube. He has a ton of tutorials for retro gaming setups, and I followed his videos quite closely whenever I had problems.<br/>For PS2 saves: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0</a><br/>For PS1 saves: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0</a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2 Save Splitting</b></div><p>For PS2 saves, Archades' video pointed to a dev named K3zter.

The script relies on program called <code>mymc</code> created by another developer, gastroman. As the description says, you can download that program here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/">sourceforget/mymc</a>. All contents of mymc distribution should be placed in the <code>mymc</code> folder.</p><p>The save-splitter distribution has an <code>import</code> and an <code>export</code> folder. Pretty self-explanatory. Put all your saves in the import folder, run the script, and all of the split saves will be in the export folder. </p><p>The script is run from a PowerShell instance and you need to Run it as an Administrator, since it'll be moving and editing files. Once opened, navigate to the script's location, and execute the script by typing:</p><p><pre>.\split.ps1</pre></p><p>The script may not run at first because Windows doesn't want you to run scripts that change the contents of your computer without you understanding what you're actually doing.

It's a device created from a community standard that converts analog video signals into digital signals, primarily for retro video game consoles. It has 3 inputs, SCART, component, and VGA, and will output HDMI. I'm primary using this with a Playstation 2, but the Analogue Pocket's Analogizer is also hooked up to it. I recently got mine from AliExpress for $90. Then I bought an acrylic outer case for $20.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The era of the Playstation 2 was the last video game generation to use analog video signals as a standard. Starting with the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, consoles natively supported HDMI, and now its standard on absolutely everything. Prior to HDMI, RCA composite cables were standard in North America and Japan, while SCART was standard in Europe. But, for North America, the highest quality video you could get used RGB composite cables.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2 Component Cables</b></div><p>For the Playstation 2, the official component cables are one of the best options. But the actual official ones are hard to find and usually expensive. Also, there are many bootlegs cables being sold as official. Signal integrity is very important to analog video, so cheap cables can eat away at the quality. So, the actual best PS2 video cables on the market are the cables from Retrovision.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think they look cheap on the outside, but the internals are not. The inner components are perfectly shielded and expertly crafted to ensure the highest quality, strongest signal possible from source to destination. They were $30 on Amazon, not too much more expensive than others.</p><div class='title'><b>Signals and Resolutions</b></div><p>For the most part, by default, the Playstation 2 outputs a 480i resolution. In general, this is a 640x480 resolution drawn with interlacing. I'm not an expert, but I have come to understand that interlacing draws the video with overlapping alternating lines. A complete single frame is split into two images alternatingly drawn on top of each other, which creates two frames instead one.</p><p>Modern TVs with HDMI use progressive scan to draw the image on a TV. A single frame is drawn from top to bottom in order without alternating lines. Some Playstation 2 games have the option of output 480p, where p stands for progressive. The OSSC loves a 480p signal because, even though it is being passed as an analog signal, it's in a digital format, and that's what modern TVs want.</p><p>The 480i signal is more annoying. The OSSC needs to convert the interlaced signals into progressive, and it uses bob deinterlacing to do this. Bob deinterlacing takes the half-drawn image from the first frame and treats it as progressive. It's only 240 tall, so it doubles the height. Then it does the same with the next frame, the other half of the image. Another name for this technique is line doubling.</p><p>So, we want to set up the OSSC to handle <b>480p</b> and <b>480i</b> signals.</p><p>People have made a list of all Playstation 2 games that support 480p (and other resolutions) and how to enable it.<br/><a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes" title="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes">https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes</a></p><div class='title'><b>480p Signals</b></div><p>Overall, if a game supports 480p (or any progressive scan format), we want to use it. Using OPL, there's a way to force this. GSM, or <b>Graphics Synthesizer Mode Selector</b>, is another unofficial PS2 app that works with OPL. When choosing a game in OPL, you can hit <code>triangle</code> to enter the Game Settings menu. Then enter the GSM Settings menu. For 480p available games, enable GSM and switch the "Mode" to 480p.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Be sure to save the Game Settings! Now, when you launch the game, it will automatically run in 480p.</p><div class='title'><b>OSSC Settings</b></div><p><b>Note:</b> I'm still trying to find the best settings.

| June 20, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the best features of the Playstation 2 on its release was backwards compatibility with Playstation 1 games. In those recent years, no home console had been backwards compatible with its predecessor, mainly because of cartridges. So having a new console being able to play your current game library was a massive boost.</p><p>This was accomplished by including the original Playstation hardware inside of the Playstation 2. Over time, this extra hardware was shrunk, and eventually relegated to software emulation, which wasn't perfect.</p><p>Anyways, with getting OPL and a Games server working for the Playstation 2, I wanted Playstation 1 working in the same way. The overall process for Playstation 1 games is similar to Playstation 2 games, but the steps are different.</p><p>Here is my set up for the Playstation 2 with OPL, the file server, and everything else:<br/><a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">/returning-to-the-playstation-2</a></p><div class='title'><b>POPStarter</b></div><p>Even though the Playstation 2 has the Playstation 1 hardware for games, the games will be run in software. Unfortunately, there's no way around this. <b>POPS</b> is Sony's Playstation 1 emulator that runs on the ps2, and OPL's method of using this is called POPStarter. It stands for Playstation One Portable Station, probably.</p><p><b>Note</b>: There are two ways of setting up Playstation 1 games and POPstarter using OPL and I'm using the old way. This way is only compatible using OPL Anniversary Edition. The latest versions of OPL have removed this method of execution for a newer method which has a slightly better success rate for compatibility. I'm not sure if it works through SMB, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, my Playstation 2 setup is streaming games through the ethernet port using an SMB server hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. I need to add POPStarter configuration on my memory card with Free McBoot. And then, there are some additional files required for the file server along with the games.</p><div class='title'><b>POPSTARTER Configuration for the Memory Card</b></div><p>Because I'm running Playstation 1 games from the SMB File Share, I needed to download a specific POPStarter setup for the memory card. I downloaded <b>POPSTARTER.zip</b> found on the following page: <br/><a href="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/">https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/</a></p><p>When unzipped it will give a <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder. This entire folder will be copied to the Free McBoot memory card, but we need to change two things first.</p><p>First, we need to change the <code>IPCONFIG.DAT</code> file. This contains the ip details of the PS2. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PS2-IP-ADDRESS NETMASK GATEWAY</pre></p><p>These details are all found in the Network Settings of OPL. The PS2-IP-ADDRESS is the IP address of the PS2 on the network. The Netmask is the same one in OPL. And the Gateway is the IP address of the File server. All of these are listed in OPL's Network Config menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Note</b>: Originally, my Playstation 2 IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>. POPS does not like it when the IPs of the Playstation 2 and the File Server are on different subnets, so I changed the PS2's IP address in OPL to <code>192.168.2.10</code>. This solved my problem.</p><p>Here is my completed file:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1</pre></p><p>Next, we need to change <code>SMBCONFIG.DAT</code>. This tells popstarter where the files are located on the network. OPL knows where the files are, but it doesn't tell POPS this information when it launches, so we need to add this information here. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PC-IP-ADDRESS PS2SMB<br/>username<br/>password</pre></p><p>There's the server's IP address, the server's folder name, and the login details. I'm using the SMB Share setup on the Raspberry Pi, so here are my details:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.1 share</pre></p><p>There are no login details, so those lines are omitted. The share on the Pi is just <code>share</code>, and it's running on that IP.</p><div class='title'><b>Memory Card Installation</b></div><p>The <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder and all of its contents will be copied to the Memory Card with Free McBoot. To do this, we'll need to put all these files on a simple USB Drive and plug that directly into a USB slot of the PS2.</p><p>After turning on the PS2 with Free McBoot, you'll need to open uLaunchELF, which is a file browser for the Playstation 2. The drive marked <code>mass</code> is your USB drive, <code>mc0</code> is the memory card in the first slot, and <code>mc1</code> is the memory card in the second slot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In <code>mass</code>, select (mark) your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder, hit <code>R1</code> to pull up the menu, and select copy. Navigate to <code>mc0</code> for your Free McBoot card, hit <code>R1</code> again, and select paste. This will copy your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder to the memory card.</p><p>Your memory card setup is complete.</p><div class='title'><b>File Server Files</b></div><p>On the file server, Playstation 1 games are put in the <code>POPS</code> folder, but we need another file for the emulator to work, the emulator itself! The file for the actual emulator is named <code>POPS_IOX.PAK</code>. It's not too difficult to find through a Google search, but this file contains copyrighted information by Sony, so search at your own risk. </p><p>This last file we're going to need is <code>POPSTARTER.ELF</code>. ELF files are applications that run on the Playstation 2, and this is POPStarter application that runs the emulator. When you select a game in OPL, it will open that game with this application.</p><p>With everything set up, now we need some games.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>POPStarter and OPL requires Playstation 1 Games in the VCD format and using the same filename format as PS2 games. When you illegally download any Playstation 1 game, it'll most likely be in the bin/cue format. So, you'll need to convert them.</p><p>The best program to do this with is called <b>PFS BatchKit Manager</b>. It can be found on GitHub here:<br/><a href="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager" title="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager">https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager</a></p><p>PFS BatchKit Manager is a command line program for Windows, so Windows might complain when you try to open it. It should run within your OPL folder on your File server. Conversions are found under the Advanced Menu. Follow this route:</p><p><pre> -> 10. Advanced Menu<br/> -> 1. Conversion<br/> -> 1. Convert .bin to .vcd</pre></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It will search the <code>POPS</code> folder for any bin/cue files, and process them. First, it'll combine all the bin files into a single bin file. Then it will convert to vcd.

| June 19, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lately I have revisited the Playstation 2, my favorite console of all time. I played the PS2 for hours and hours during college, made some amazing friends through playing games, and have amazing memories of those times. So, I wanted to relive those memories as well as return to a time when video games began evolving into something with more complexity, both for story and gameplay.</p><p>I wanted to return to the PS2 in the same way I've come back to other retro consoles thanks to the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket" title="/analogue-pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>. I wanted to have a significant library of games that could easily be stored and sifted through digitally, as well as having them look their best on a modern TV. The PS2 is also backwards compatible with Playstation 1 games, so I wanted to be able to play those too. After messing around with things for about a month, I finally have everything set up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The overall set up isn't too complicated, but it has a bunch of parts required for everything to work together. To quickly explain, I'm using a memory card with Free McBoot on an original Playstation 2 slim to run Open PS2 Loader. I have a Raspberry Pi acting a network file server that OPL is connecting to in order to load games. I have a 4tb hard drive connected to the Raspberry Pi where all of the games are stored. And, the PS2 is using component video cables connected to an OSSC to digitize the video and send it to my modern TV.</p><p>All of this was inspired by another one of Tito's YouTube videos: <br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8</a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2</b></div><p>At the center of the entire set up is an actual Playstation 2. None of this entire process modifies the original console whatsoever. Everything extra can be unplugged from the Playstation 2, and it'll be the same as it was 20 years ago.</p><p>My original Playstation 2 Slim is 10,000km away back in the United States, so I bought a Japanese Slim from Yahoo Auctions. For the best possible compatibility, people had recommended the original Slim release, so I bought a SCPH-70000 model. It was really cheap at only 3000yen, and it came with the vertical stand and a few games.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In later revisions of the Playstation Slim, they moved Playstation 1 processing into software rather than hardware. They also removed legacy hard drive support, which isn't even available for the Slim.</p><div class='title'><b>Free McBoot Memory Card</b></div><p>In order for any of this to work, we need access to the Playstation 2's file system and be able to run unofficial applications. In particular, we need to be able to run <b>Open PS2 Loader</b>. Creating your own Free McBoot memory card from complete scratch has a lot of steps, but these days, you can easily buy a pre-built Free McBoot memory card from Amazon. I bought one from Amazon JP for only 1500yen.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Official Playstation 2 memory cards have the Magic Gate branding on them, which acts like a Seal of Approval ensuring that all games are compatible with it. This card doesn't have such approval and it's also 64mb compared to the official 8mb limit. Because of this, some games don't like it. We Love Katamari in particular has some saving problems.</p><p>One really nice thing about this card is that it came with absolutely everything installed on it. It already had OPL, all of the retro game emulators, and other necessary applications.</p><div class='title'><b>MemCard Pro2</b></div><p>Going one step further, 8bitmods released a device called the MemCard Pro2, which they restocked a month or two after my initial setup was complete. It is advertised as the "the last memory card you'll ever need," and with this, I no longer need a dedicated memory card with Free McBoot. Although, having an extra card with Free McBoot is handy when moving files around from Memory Card to Memory Card.</p><p>All of the details for the Memcard Pro2 are discussed in another post: <a href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">/memcard-pro2-for-ps2</a></p><div class='title'><b>Raspberry Pi 3 w/ SMB Share</b></div><p>While the hardware center is the Playstation 2 itself, the software center is the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi acts as a File Server and it is directly connected to the PS2 using an ethernet cable. </p><p>I didn't own a Raspberry Pi, so I went to Yahoo Auctions again to find a cheap one. I found a Raspberry Pi 3 with heatsinks installed and an AC adapter for 4000yen. Good deal!  Later, I bought an acrylic case with a fan for only $4 from AliExpress. Also, I had an extra LCD Monitor and a extra keyboard, so I'm using those with it, too.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In order to set up the SMB Share, you need to flash an SD card with the Playstation SMB Share. This image is found here: <a href="https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare" title="https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare">https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare</a>. I used a program called balenaEtcher to put this image on one of my extra micro SD cards.</p><p>On the initial power-up, it takes a little time to do some set-up, but eventually you'll be given a log in prompt. This happens every time the Raspberry Pi boots up. The default username is <code>pi</code> and the default password is <code>raspberry</code>. With everything set up, you'll need IP information for OPL's connection. Type in <code>ifconfig</code> and you'll be given the network data.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" /></a></p><p><pre>inet 192.168.2.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255</pre></p><p>This is the line that we care about. The Pi's IP address is <code>192.168.2.1</code>. To turn off the Raspberry Pi, type <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code>. It will shutdown, but then you'll need to unplug it. There's no actual on/off switch.</p><p><b>Note:</b> the Raspberry Pi doesn't like to plug and play. Anything you have plugged in on start up, it will auto mount, but if you plug in something after it has already been turned on, you need to manually mount the device, whether it's a keyboard, a monitor, or a usb drive. Plug in everything before you give it power for best results.</p><div class='title'><b>USB Drive</b></div><p>The SMB Server expects a USB device plugged in the Raspberry Pi to serve files from, and the device must be formatted exFat. </p><p>Every one recommends to use a USB Flash Drive, but standard USB Flash Drives aren't able to scale. They're fine if you want to have a couple of games, but I want to have a large library of games. Modern USB hard drives are pretty big. In fact, I have a few 5tb SSD drives for backing up files. But these are powered through USB. The Raspberry Pi uses a measly amount of power so it can't power anything through USB.</p><p>I had an older 4tb Western Digital hard drive with an actual hard disk, not a solid state or a flash drive. This drive has its own power connection separate from USB. By plugging this in and turning it on before powering on the Raspberry Pi, it works just like any other USB storage device. </p><div class='title'><b>Games and OPL Manager</b></div><p>The physical chain between the Playstation 2 and the games is complete, but there are two more steps. First off, we need some games. You can illegally download games for several different places online. These files come in two different flavors: ISOs and bin/cue files. </p><p><b>Open PS2 Loader</b> is the UI application used on the Playstation 2 to select and run these files, so they need to be in a particular format and have a particular file naming scheme. The USB Drive also needs to be in a particular file structure for OPL to find the games.</p><p><b>OPL Manager</b> is a PC program that will do all of this for us. You can <a href="https://oplmanager.com/site/" title="https://oplmanager.com/site/">download it here</a> or just search on Google if the location changed.</p><p>When OPL Manager first starts, it will ask for a base location. For me, I use a temp location on my USB drive for a few reasons. (One) OPL Manager can take a while to load if there are a lot of games at the location. So, when using a temp location it only needs to load the few games I'm working with at the time. Likewise, these games take up a LOT of space, so (Two) I don't want to process them locally and copy them later. This takes up a lot of space on my local computer, and takes time copying to the hard drive later. I want to work with everything on the drive, and move files around on the drive after.</p><p>Once a base location is selected, it will create all of the folders OPL requires. PS2 games will primarily go in the <code>DVD</code> folder. The <code>CD</code> folder is also for PS2 games that use CD format rather than DVD. This only matters when a game uses other tracks on the disk for audio. I don't think any PS2 game does this. All notable and modern games have their music baked into the game code, so the <code>CD</code> folder can be ignored.</p><p>There are a few other interesting folders, particular <code>THM</code>, <code>ART</code>, and <code>CFG</code>. For a further description of these folders, please read my full OPL load out post: <a href="/old/v7/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="/opl-theme-and-loadout">/opl-theme-and-loadout</a></p><p>OPL only wants games in the ISO format, so you need to convert CD/Bin games to ISO. OPL Manager can do this. Choose <code>Disc/Convert to ISO</code> under Tools, and select files from there.</p><p>Also, OPL wants a particular file format. OPL Manager will mark all the illegal filenames for you and ask you to change them. File names should start with the game's disc id, should not contain certain invalid characters, and should also not be longer than 31 characters. OPL Manager will help you make sure all of this stuff is correct.</p><p>Once all of the games are converted, I copy them into the main location and they are ready.</p><div class='title'><b>Open PS2 Loader</b></div><p>With the games ready, it's time for the Playstation 2 to find them. The USB Drive is plugged into the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is turned on and the server is running. Now, the Playstation 2 can be turned on. With the Free McBoot memory card also plugged in, Open PS2 Loader, or OPL is available from the menu. Select it, and OPL will open.</p><p>When it first boots up, there will be no games. There's a few things OPL does by default that we'll change later, but the first thing we'll need to do is configure the Network Settings so OPL can find the file server.</p><p>Hit <code>start</code> to bring up OPL settings, go to Network Config, and here is where we will enter the IP information from the Raspberry Pi we received from several steps before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the SMB Server, the PI's IP address was <code>192.168.2.1</code>, and the "Share" folder's name is <code>share</code>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Originally, my PS2's IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>, but I changed it to <code>192.168.2.10</code> to have the same LAN address as the Raspberry Pi. It's not necessary for OPL to work, but it is necessary for POPS to work with Playstation 1 games. Please read the <a href="/old/v7/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl">POPS</a> post for more details.</p><p>Overall, OPL will serve PS2 games from 3 locations: the USB drive, the hard drive, and the ethernet port. By default, it won't automatically connect to these locations. You need to hit the Circle button to connect manually. Also, the hard drive is selected by default. All of this can be changed in the OPL Setting menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By default, I am displaying the Ethernet games on Start Up. Since we're not using the USB Drive and Hard Drive for games, nor are we using any Applications, I disable all 3 of these options in the menu. And for both Ethernet games and Playstation games, I have OPL connecting to these sources automatically on start up.  Now, when OPL opens all of my Playstation 2 games will be shown immediately.</p><p><b>Note:</b> I'm using OPL Anniversary Edition which has Playstation as a menu display. The latest versions of OPL have removed the Playstation menu and force everything to be run from the Applications menu for better compatibility.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 1 Games</b></div><p>We can also run Playstation 1 games using OPL. As mentioned above, this is only available through OPL Anniversary Edition as a separate menu. I have detailed that process in a different post:<br/><a href="/old/v7/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl">/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl</a></p><div class='title'><b>OPL Themes and Metadata</b></div><p>OPL allows you to customize its appearance with an overall theme. You can also have artwork and metadata for all of the games. I put all of these details in a different post:<br/><a href="/old/v7/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="/opl-theme-and-loadout">/opl-theme-and-loadout</a></p><div class='title'><b>Video Conversion and the OSSC</b></div><p>There is one final link in this entire PS2 chain, and that is the video output. The video game generation of the Playstation 2 was the final generation to output analog video by default. HDMI became the standard for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and now everything is HDMI. Without any additional modification, Component video is the highest quality available for the PS2. I'm using the Retrovision Component cables for the PS2, which are apparently the absolute best.</p><p>Analog video must be converted to digital, and that's where I'm using the OSSC.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The OSSC isn't too difficult to get working, but it can send you down a rabbit hole of optimization headaches.

The Raspberry Pi 3 is running a local network server serving files from a 4tb hard drive across a wired LAN connection to the Playstation 2. The Playstation 2 is running OPL from the Memory Card which finds these games and will play them. The video signal is being converted by the OSSC to a modern TV.
