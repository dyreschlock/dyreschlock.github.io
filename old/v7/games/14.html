| May 31, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>This weekend I played Infamous.  From 4pm yesterday to about 9pm today, with a quick 6 hour nap in the middle.  I think it's somewhat sad that a single near 30 year old decided to spend his free weekend playing a video game almost 23 hours... But shut up.  I haven't had a free weekend in a while, and Infamous is pretty fun.</p><p>Infamous is a new Playstation 3 exclusive game which came out this week.  It's made by Sucker Punch, who are the development team behind the Sly Cooper franchise on PS2.  Last week, they released a demo on PSN and I liked it quite a bit.  So I cleared out my Gamefly queue, and got it in the mail rather promptly.</p><p>You play as Cole McGrath, who's been given Super Powers from the epicenter of a massive explosion that has killed 10,000 people in Empire City.  However, the military has labeled you responsible for the explosion and its up to you to find the real culprit.  Throughout your journey you'll restore order to Empire City, which has been taken over by street thugs.  Blah Blah Blah...</p><p>Cole has the power of electricity and can fire lightning bolts, create shockwaves.  He also has super-strength somehow because he can climb up the side of a building then leap all the way back to the ground without being hurt.</p><p>In Empire City, you can go anywhere and do anything, pretty much.  It's a free roaming sandbox sort of game.  Much like <b>Grand Theft Auto</b>, <b>Crackdown</b>, <b>Assassin's Creed</b>, etc...  There are story missions and side missions throughout the map and you can do them whenever you like.  The twist is the added morality gauge!  You decide whether Cole will be a Hero to Empire City, or its next up and coming Villian.</p><p>That's Infamous in a nutshell.  On the surface it seems like just another game, but Sucker Punch has carefully studied what's wrong with this sub-genre.  Infamous does a lot of things right, but still forgets about some fundamental problems..</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Recognized Difficulty.</b></div><p>At the very beginning, after you escape the crater, you get in your first fire fight with the Thugs.  This is your first mission, Spoiler!  You pull out your lightning hand and begin zapping all the bad guys.  When I completed this mission, the game automatically bumped me up to Hard Mode.  "Ok, you're way too good at shooting dudes.  Normal will be way too easy, you deserve Hard."</p><p>And the game was right!  For me, Hard Mode has worked out great.  It's still been pretty easy.  But there's never been a time when I've been so frustrated I couldn't eventually handle it.  Great Feature!</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Hidden crap shows up on the radar.</b></div><p>In any of those games mentioned above, there's a whole lot of stupid crap hidden through out the world.  Grand Theft Auto has 'em.  Assassin's Creed has 'em.  By gull, Infamous has to have 'em.  Infamous has  Dead Drops and Blast Shards scattered throughout Empire City.  They don't show up on the map, but if you click L3 to do your Spidey Sense, if you have one within range of your Rader, they'll appear!  Searching for this stuff has never been easier.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Hidden crap actually means something.</b></div><p>What real incentive is there to locate anything of this hidden stuff, anyways.  They only things collecting all the packages in Grand Theft Auto gave you was an Achievement.  In Infamous, the hidden stuff is actually useful.  Blast Shards are a means of leveling up your electricity gauge.  When you collect a certain amount, your capicity for holding electricty increases.  Dead Drops are encrypted transmissions that will give you further insight into the background of the story.  Collecting them all also gives you Achievements too.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Every side mission helps you.</b></div><p>In most games, side missions are usually just excuses to level your character or provide some aspect of the story that's not important.  The side missions in Infamous do that too, but when you complete one the territory that Thug's control begins to diminish.  More people return to the area and enemies retreat from the area.  When you go back to the area later for a story mission, it's a lot easier because the amount of enemies have lessened.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Magnetic Physics makes platforming easy.</b></div><p>Cole can climb walls, street lamps.. basically anything with a patruding space can be grabbed and climbed.  Which is a lot like Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge.  What's the point of running around a city, if you can't run around on rooftops!  The most annoying part of those two games is when you miss the mark just ever so slightly when you feel you totally nailed it.</p><p>Sucker Punch added a little bit of magnets into the physics so when you're climbing or falling, if you're near something that can be grabbed, Cole will naturally move closer to it.  It makes the hit box much larger, and platforming isn't really that annoying.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Being totally good has its subtle benefits.</b></div><p>No, It doesn't change the story at all.  It probably changes the ending, but the overall story is still the same.  What I really really like is when you're morality gauge is complete filled to good, the citizens of Empire City will actually help you fight the Thugs!  They'll start throwing rocks at the bad guys which makes them easier for Cole to kill!  That's awesome!  They'll cheer you on when you kill Thugs.  They'll cheer you on if you help them out.</p><p>Though, I'd wager that if you were totally Evil, the people would probably throw rocks at you.<br/>___</p><p>These are pretty small things, but they make Infamous incredibly solid.  They removed the more annoying aspects of the annoying parts on the game!  Like searching for hidden crap and platforming.  It ends up making the game less annoying and increases the mileage tremendously.</p><p>After 23 hours, I haven't been pissed off at the game once.  If I die or screw up, it's usually my fault and not the games.  That's quite an accomplishment because <b>most games are stupid and annoying and Infamous really isn't.</b> (&lt;---  Box Quote)</p><p>Playing Infamous is definitely where Infamous shines.  If people talk about Infamous, it'll be about some they did in the game.  Not something that the game did for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Hated!</b></div><p>But unfortunately, that's where Infamous' legacy falls apart for me.  There is nothing special about the Sound, the Music, the Story, the Characters...  Playing the game is great, but everything else falls flat and makes it rather unmemorable.</p><p>All I care about is my morality level, how many blast shards I still need to find, and the other side missions I have left.  I don't care about Cole at all.  I don't care about the climax of the game, nor what Villians I've killed.  Boss Fights have been anti-climatic because who cares?  They're just a bigger version of dudes I've fought earlier.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto IV was repetitive and way too long, but I cared about Niko and was sad when <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>bleep</em></span> died.  Niko is a great character, and that's what I remembered most from the game.  The other characters too.  "Cousin!"  There is nothing memorable about Cole or Zeke or any other character in Infamous.</p><p>So, after playing Infamous for 23 hours, <b>I really haven't gotten anything out of the experience at all</b>.  I wonder if its really worth while for me to take another 5 or 6 hours to finish the game.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: Tokyo Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition">Games I buy: Tokyo Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 27, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>While in Tokyo, Japan, I spent some time shopping for games, which is something I generally do whenever I'm in a new area.  Whether I'm returning home to Minneapolis, visiting my friend in Tampa, Florida, or flying overseas to Japan, I'll find the locations of the Used game stores and try to visit each one.</p><p>I'm not searching for anything in Particular.  I generally browse their selection and check prices for all of their stock.  Occasionally, I'll come across a game or a price that sets off some alarm bells in my head.  "Wow, they have a copy of Dragon Force on Saturn.  Sweet."..  "Holy crap, Psychonauts on PS2 for $20?!"</p><p>While I'm still in the US, I'll pull out my cellphone and check the price against what is listed on Half.com.  If there's more than a $15 gap in favor of the game I found, I'll buy it and list it on Half.com when I get home.  But, if it's a game I'd be interested in playing sometime in the future, I'll probably buy it anyways.</p><p>These days, I haven't bought a whole lot of new games because I have almost everything I want.  Or I feel that I have too much and should stop buying games.</p><p>That's not the case in Japan.  In Japan, used games for retro consoles are pretty cheap, so when I come across a game with Gem-like qualities, I'll buy it.  And such is the case with every game on this list, except this first one.</p><p class='img'><b>PS3/Bluray - Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete</b> 1st Edition<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" /></p><p>Though, Advent Children Complete really isn't a game.  The 1st Edition release contained the demo for Final Fantasy XIII on PS3.  I decided to buy it because Square has no plans to release a disc version of the demo in North America.  And the Advent Children Complete film is entirely in english.  Or, at least, subtitled.</p><p>I figured the "1st Edition" might be difficult to come by since it's a first edition.  But, Square saw fit to produce nearly 2 million first editions of this set, so this product was everywhere.  Every store I went to had copies of Advent Children Complete.  Most used stores even had it.  In fact, Yamada Lavi in Shibuya, which is where I bought it, actually had their copies discounted to around $52.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - English of the Dead</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" /></p><p>While browsing game stores in Shinjuku, I came across English of the Dead for the DS at a Softmap.  I was instantly entranced by the sheer concept and the throwback to Typing of the Dead for Dreamcast.  It's basically the same game!  Instead of typing out words to kill zombies, you translate Kanji into English.  What a perfect vehicle to learn more Kanji!  Instant Purchase.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" /></p><p>I found this game at a Trader located in Akihabara for a mere $20!  For those who don't know, the Doki Doki Majo Shinpan is a dating sim sort of game where you must determine whether or not underaged school girls are witches.  In order to make that determination you must touch and grope these girls with the DS Stylus.  Take a look at this video for a demonstration: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw</a></p><p>The first Doki Doki Majo Shinpan was release in 2007 and prompted much internet humor.  In 2008, SNK released this follow-up that was rated even higher on their Adult-content scale.</p><p>Anyways, $20 is pretty cheap for one of the more bizarre Japanese DS releases.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Ketsui Death Label</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" /></p><p>This is one of the rarest DS games to date.  Ketsui is a "bullet-hell" shooter made by Cave.  It was released in limited run and contained a DVD with video of professionals running through the game perfectly.  I found Ketsu when I started doing my serious game hunting during my trip.  It was only $46 at Geo in North West Shinjuku.  $46 is an excellent price considering it goes for 2 to 3 times that on ebay.</p><p class='img'><b>Dreamcast -

| April 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>2 weeks ago Nintendo released the third generation of the Nintendo DS entitled the DSi. The DSi doesn't iterate on the visual design of the DS Lite, but makes several hardware changes. The screens are slightly bigger and brighter. The speakers are more clear. The power button has moved. They've also added 2 low quality cameras for some reason.</p><p>But the biggest change is the removal of the Gameboy Slot on the bottom of the unit. It's sad that nearly 20 years after the original release of the Gameboy that that name will no longer carried. But oh well.. It's been a very long time since I've even used that slot for games.</p><p>With removal of the GBA slot comes the addition of an SD card slot. The SD slot is located on the side where the power button used to be. The primary purchase for this is to store downloadable games and applications from the DSi store, which opened on the same day of the DSi launch.</p><div class='title'><b>Is it worth it?</b></div><p>Yes, yes, all these features are all well and good but does this really warrant a purchase? There's a little bit more processor power, and a little bit bigger screens. But essentially the DSi is identical to the DS Lite. There's no killer-app on the DSi store and no plans for DSi specific games. Why waste $170 buying a new DS?</p><p>Well, my reason for wanting a DSi is the same reason a few others are willing to "upgrade": My DS is beat to shit. I own a launch Japanese DS and over these past 3 years my DS has been my most played gaming platform. I've played the thing so much the touch screen can no longer be re-calibrated to precision. Those super-market credit card signature pads have more precision than my DS touch screen. Trauma Center is unplayable!</p><p>In addition, there's been a tiny renaissance of games lately. (ie: Pokemon Platinum, Tokyo Beat Down, Docomo Dake, Retro Game Challenge, Harry Hatsworth.) There's also a few future titles to look forward to. (ie: Edgeworth Perfect Prosecutor and Zelda Train Simulator.) There's also some great games from the past year that I missed. (ie: Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Trauma Center 2, Bangaioh Spirits.)</p><p>I think an upgrade to workable DS hardware isn't such a bad idea.</p><div class='title'><b>Region locking</b></div><p>Up until now, all Nintendo portable hardware was region free. You can play any Japanese games on an American DS and vice versa. But Nintendo had announced that the Nintendo DSi is region locked. What does that actually mean, though?</p><p>Well, for #1: The Japanese DSi will only have access to the Japanese DSi store. Americans can only access the American store. I think that was already obvious given the way the Wii store works. Unlike Xbox or PSN, the region is embedded in the device itself. So the only way to access a store outside of your region is the purchase the device for that region.</p><p>Pros: Access to kooky Japanese games not available in the US. Games like the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html">Katamari Puzzle</a> game, which may or may not actually be fun. The Art Style series which includes <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html">Decode</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html">Pico Pict</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html">Somnium</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html">Hacolife</a>, and a couple others. These games remind me a lot of Bit Generations. The Dr. Mario games is over there too.</p><p>Cons: I won't have access to the American games. Though, I don't really see this as much of a Con since the games I care about will already be on the Japanese DSi store.</p><p>#2: DSi Region locking could also mean that DSi specific cartridge based games are un-playable on other regioned devices. Though, this hasn't actually been confirmed since Nintendo has not mentioned any plans of making DSi specific games. However, if they did plan to make DSi specific games, and they were region locked than I would not be able to play American games.</p><p>#3: DLC. Let's say cartridges were not region locked and they were some DSi-only cartridge games. Well, if Nintendo introduced DLC for these titles, it wouldn't be able to access the store for my American games. Though, are there any games for Wii that have DLC?</p><div class='title'><b>Do I buy import?</b></div><p>Personally, I'm going to bet on DSi-only carts being region-free, even though I really have no proof to back that up. That's a problem for future-Me anyways, since all current DS software is region free.</p><p>The decision of whether I buy domestic or import comes to down to the DSi store. It's hard to judge the American DSi store after a mere two weeks of operation, but there are definitely some Japanese games that will never be released here.</p><p>So, I think I will buy a Japanese DSi. They are $20 more expensive than the US ones and come in a few colors not available in the US including <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html">Pink, Navy and Lime</a>.</p><p>In 10 days, I leave for Japan. When I'm over there I'll either chose a Navy or Lime one. Who knows, though. I might change my mind while I'm in Japan. Or I might not be able to find any. $200 can always buy something else.</p><p>That's not the only thing on my shopping list: <a href="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html" title="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html" title="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html">http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html</a>.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nuka Cola Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nuka-cola-recipe">Nuka Cola Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

with what is going on, but my ears only get to do something when talking with coworkers.  So I listen to a lot of music and podcasts.  Usually back and forth between the two, rather than a mix.  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for music.  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for talking and chatter.  My job goes back and forth between planning and execution constantly, so it's a great way to keep the boring execution phase of my job lively.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" loading="lazy"

formerly CGWRadio.  The Brodeo starred the editors of Games For Windows Magazine formerly Computer Gaming World, who were Jeff Green, Ryan Scott, Shawn Elliot and Sean Malloy with Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.</p><p>CGWRadio began on February 16th, 2006.  The first couple episodes were a little odd, but they eventually figured it out.  On August 8th, 2006, they announced that CGW would become GFW and in November launched their first issue.</p><p>GFWRadio combined a unique brand of gaming humor with the trials and annoyances of working in the gaming journalism business and the joy of being in the business.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>After listening to GFWRadio, I never thought I'd have such an insight into the gaming media.  This type of perspective is something that I never even thought about 4 years ago being a gamer.  4 years ago, I was still writing about games, but I never had the insight as to what the game's designers were thinking about, what the publishers were doing to promote the game, and what really went into making the game to begin with.  I know so much more now-a-days about the pressures these publishing companies put on game reviews and journalists on exactly what they say about a game.</p><p>They also talked a lot about the themes in games and what the game really meant to them and wouldn't pull any punches.  They'd give you their complete honesty opinion on what the game did right and what the game did wrong.  They'd also completely deconstruct some games talking about character interaction, plot devices and themes.</p><p>Discussions on GFWRadio were a good balance between these industry related topics, and high-brow video game analysis, but weren't afraid to go completely low-brow too and talk about stupid things they do or have done.  It's really just a bunch of guys bullshitting about their jobs, lives and games they play.</p><p>That's really where the term <b>Brodeo</b> came from.  Jeff Green was browsing around Urban Dictionary and found this definition: <em>A get-together or a party where the attendance is predominantly male.</em>  He brought it up on the podcast and the cult following of GFWRadio labeled it as such.</p><p>The real humor of the show came from "Hero's of the Web", Dramatic Readings, Stories of griefing and gaming, and other coined terms, segments and jokes that became running gags.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>April 8th, 2008 marked the beginning of the end as Ziff Davis put a hard start to Games For Windows Magazine.  Actually, I suppose, Ziff Davis declaring bankruptcy was really the beginning of the end.  But shifting from a print magazine to the online space wasn't really something the GFW editors had been prepared for.</p><p>I wish I would've evangelized this podcast more when it was in its prime, but oh well.  Popularity is not the reason it's ending.  It's ending because the key voices of the show have now gone on to do bigger and better things.</p><p>In June, Sean Malloy announced that he had gotten a job for Blizzard and left 1up.  Last week, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and he left to work on the Sims with Maxis and EA.  And this week, Shawn Elliot finishes up the Brodeo and heads off to 2K Boston to work with Ken Levine (creator of Bioshock) on his next project.</p><p>Ryan Scott, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos are still at 1up and have said that they'll continue to podcast in some form or do something, but the actual Brodeo, has ended.</p><p>Times change.  Jobs change.  People grow up.  You complete college, you gotta move on.  You get your first job or your break in the Industry.  You usually start at the same place many other begin as well.  Eventually, you gotta move up in the Industry.  So that's basically it.</p><p>A lot of voices have moved on from 1up, but there's plenty of new voices as well.  With the Brodeo gone, I think I'll turn my attention to 1up FM, 1up's new podcast.</p><p>My hope is for a GFW Reunion at PAX 2009. ^_^  It was neat meeting Shawn Elliot at PAX, but I really didn't get to say too much to him.</p><div class='title'><b>Errata</b></div><p

Hahah. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure why you'd really want World of Warcraft: Wraith of the Lich King on a playable kiosk, anyways.  All you'd really want to show off is the Death Knight and some of the new areas.  For a little while, I watched one guy play and he was a Gnome Warrior running around...  What a waste of time.  They did have some demonstrations of Lich King, though, so it wasn't all a waste.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX: Spore Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-spore-impressions">PAX: Spore Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
