| October 13, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last month, the Analogue Pocket has continued to be an absolute monster. The Sega Genesis is now available. The Nintendo Entertainment System is now available. Sega GameGear is available, too. And there have been many cores of 1980s Arcade games released, too.</p><p>It's starting to get unwieldily, so I've created a collection of programs to help me organize and process games so they can be played on the Pocket.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils</a></p><p>I've been working on this pretty solidly for the past three weeks, and I think it's finally feature finished. The GitHub repository has straight forward information of how each process is set up and what exactly each process does. But, overall…</p><p>Pocket Utils is a collection of scripts and programs that do several things, including the following: (1) Process MRA files and Create Arcade Roms, (2) Create Library Images for sorted Games, and (3) Update Platform information for cores.</p><div class='title'><b>Process MRA Files</b></div><p>The Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator, or MAME, on computer standardized how to emulate arcade games. When ripping games from their original boards, each component had their own file, and everything was put together in a zip file. </p><p>FPGA emulation of arcade games doesn't like this. The chip wants direct read access to the data it wants and unzipping a file in memory is extra useless overhead. Thus, the idea of a MRA file was introduced. A MRA file contains specific instructions on how each piece of the arcade board can be assembled into a single ROM file. This file is not compressed and allow free access to all the data the FPGA wants. </p><p>A separate program is required to process these MRA files, though. I use this <a href="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c" title="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c">MRA Tool</a> found in NullObject's GitHub. When an arcade core is released for the Analogue Pocket, it'll come with MRA files to create ROMs from ZIP files of arcade components. You must get the arcade ROM zips, process the MRA file in the program giving it the zip files, and then place the generated ROM into the core's folder on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>There are lots of steps to getting this to work, and many arcade cores released for the Analogue Pocket play multiple games. Some releases come with 10 or more games. In fact, arcade systems like Capcom CPS1 and CPS2 have as many as 300 variants of their games. Doing all of this manually is not feasible.</p><p>This program solves this problem.</p><p>Put all of your MRA files in the to-be-processed directory. Run the program. It'll attempt to download any and all ZIP files required to make the arcade rom, and store them locally. If the Arcade ROM is successfully generated, it'll copy it to the correct directory on the Pocket, and also copy the MRA file to the Pocket, too.</p><p>If it can't find the ZIP files online, you can manually search for them and put them in your local store. If a ROM was already generated, it'll copy over the MRA file anyway. If the MRA file is already there, it'll copy it to a duplicate directory.</p><p>With Standard games, everything works really well and there are almost never any problems. Problems usually only come up when trying to generate bootlegs or hacks of roms. Those often require extra steps.</p><div class='title'><b>Create Library Images</b></div><p>One of the most appealing features of the Analogue Pocket is the Library feature. </p><p>Something I've never liked about using emulators is having to choose the games I want to play from a list. It's so sterile and clinical. The Super Nintendo Mini was so amazing because of its visual presentation. You had a line games presented with their box art. And you could visually choose the game you wanted to play by selecting that box art.</p><p>The Library feature of the Analogue Pocket was just that. It gave you a visual list of all your games to select from. Further still, you could organize all of your games in Playlists. This was promised in Analogue's Tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888" title="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888">Analogue OS</a>.</p><p>By default, the Analogue Pocket has an internal list of game data but it doesn't have an images. Early on, you could download an image pack that gave you all the title screens for every game. But I don't want title screens. I want box arts.</p><p>It took a little while to figure out, but the Analogue Pocket uses a CRC hash of the file to reference which image is uses in the Library. If you have a correctly sized PNG file, you can run it through <a href="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter" title="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter">DerTolleEmil</a>'s Image Converter and it'll give you a BIN file. Put this bin file in the correct folder named with the CRC hash, and it'll use this image in the Library.</p><p>So, my program goes a bit further with it.</p><p>In each of the folders for Consoles and Handhelds on the Analogue Pocket, I have the ROMs that I like sorted into genre folders. My initial "CreatePocketEntries" program will collect all of these games in my database. "CreateLibraryImages" will look at every game in my database and attempt to download the box art image from <a href="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails" title="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails">LibRetro</a> on Github. With this image, my program will resize it to the correct dimensions for the Pocket, convert the PNG image to BIN, name it correctly, and copy the file to the System folder on the Pocket.</p><p>Now, when using the Library, the image matches the box art. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Update Platform Information</b></div><p>Another thing that I collect in my database is Core information.</p><p>When a user chooses a core from the openFPGA menu on the Pocket, it lists certain information about itself, such as when the console or handheld was original released, who was the manufacture, and also the name and category of the core, too. All core developers are very particular about the accurate representation of the consoles, games, and their code, so this information is usually correct, but sometime it is not to avoid copyright and trademark violations.</p><p>In the database, it's easy for me to edit this information and also collect all the information into categories. My program will rewrite all of the information in the Platforms directory with what I have in my database. </p><p>Additionally, it'll create Platform Images using agg23's <a href="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process" title="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process">Platform Image Creator</a>. Any new images that I've made and placed in the processing directory will be converted and copied over.</p><div class='title'><b>Run the Updater</b></div><p>There is also a simple shell script that runs <a href="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility" title="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility">Matt Pannella</a>'s command line program with all of the settings that I like.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I use this stuff pretty often when new cores and new features are released, so there continue to be more updates. When Playlists eventually come to the Pocket, I'll have a new program to make those. I'm also working on another program that will make a list of games I have in my "unsorted" directories for each core.</p><p>The Pocket continues to be one of the absolute best gaming devices made, and being able to make all this stuff to organize games has gotten back into programming on the side. It's been pretty great. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Analogue Pocket" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket">Analogue Pocket</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 19, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Analogue Pocket has become one of my favorite gaming consoles (or handheld) of all time. Initially announced as a modern device that plays games from the family of GameBoys, it has grown to become exactly what I wanted and has yet to reach its full potential.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_0546_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Analogue</b></div><p>Analogue is a company that specializes in creating retro gaming consoles. They are most widely known for making a $200 Nintendo and a $200 Super Nintendo. You can plug your original cartridges from these systems into these new ones, and everything still works. There have been several other machines that have done this in recent years, but Analogue’s edge is its use of the FPGA.</p><p>Internally, Analogue has reversed engineered and replicated the original chipsets of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo and have them running on a chip called an FPGA. This means that the games aren’t running in emulation on a PC or on Linux or something. It’s running the original processors EXACTLY the same way the original hardware did.</p><p>By doing this, Analogue has replicated the exact original look and feel of the original console to near perfection.</p><div class='title'><b>Analogue Pocket Announcement</b></div><p>On <b>October 16th, 2019</b>, Analogue announced its newest hardware recreation, the Analogue Pocket. The Analogue Pocket would be their first handheld device, and it would play GameBoy, GameBoy Color, and GameBoy Advanced games. Sold separately, you could also buy a Dock that would charge the device and hook up to a TV.</p><p>However, the biggest hint at its potential was the inclusion of a second FPGA chipset. A primary FPGA was included that would run a Game cartridge, but the second FPGA would be open to developers to do whatever they wanted with. This meant that it may be possible for people to play their own Game roms on the device. And this also meant that people could write code for other consoles to be played, like a Game Gear, or a Sega Genesis, or a Super Nintendo.</p><p>Recently I had been able to rediscover many amazing retro games thanks to the Super Nintendo Mini. But, the Mini was cumbersome and could only play certain games. If the Pocket could play Super Nintendo and other stuff, too, it would be like the Nintendo Switch for retro games. I could play Super Nintendo portably, or plug it into the TV and play them there. It would be perfect.</p><div class='title'><b>Analogue Pocket Release</b></div><p>Almost a year later on August 1st, a date and time was announced when you could buy one. For me, it would be Midnight on <b>August 4th 2020</b>. Hype for the device began to buzz around the Internet with even Elijah Wood posting about it. Of course, this was the height of global lockdown from the Coronavirus, so any news on the Internet spread very quickly. I planned on staying up to secure my order.</p><p>Analogue’s Store page went live at Midnight, and I knew exactly what I wanted: Black Pocket, Dock, Case, Screen Protector, and Cable. Putting things into my cart was easy, but actually purchasing was a nightmare. The pages took a while to load, or didn’t load at all. I typed in all of my information and hit save, but international shipping took a while to appear. I kept hitting that Purchase button to conclude the sale, and eventually it went through. After waking up the next day, a purchase confirmation email was in my inbox. It was a success! My order was in the #54xxx range.</p><p>The Pocket was expected to release in early or mid-2021. That was pushed to October, and then it was pushed again. Finally, orders began shipping in December, and on <b>December 24th, 2021</b>, my Pocket arrived in the mail. Over 2 years after its announcement, and over 1 year after its purchase.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1260_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Analogue Pocket</b></div><p>Out of the box, the Analogue Pocket does exactly what it says it would do. You plug in a GameBoy game, it plays perfectly fine. You plug in a GameBoy Advance game, it plays perfectly fine. But that was all that it did. On release, the second FPGA chip was not yet available for other developers to use.</p><p>Fast forward to <b>July 30th 2022</b> and <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1553032922143330306" title="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1553032922143330306">the first firmware update</a> was released. The second FPGA was now available and the first core was released which recreated Spacewar, the first interactive game ever created on a computer.</p><div class='title'><b>Neo Geo</b></div><p>A day later, something amazing showed up online. There was a <a href="https://github.com/Mazamars312/Analogue_Pocket_Neogeo" title="https://github.com/Mazamars312/Analogue_Pocket_Neogeo">core for the Neo Geo</a>. The Neo Geo was a console released in the 90s which was identical to the company's Arcade hardware. It was the first time you could play perfect versions of Arcade games in your home. It was very expensive, so very few people actually bought it.</p><p>The Neo Geo is home to some of my favorite games of all time, now they were available on the Pocket. And they looked absolutely stunning.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1951_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220917_pocket/IMG_1952_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Not all games played at first, but the ones that worked were perfect. They looked amazing, sounded amazing, and played amazing. As of today, <b>September 19th, 2022</b> with its most recent update, all Neo Geo games are playable.</p><div class='title'><b>Super Nintendo</b></div><p>Also, today-ish the dream has finally come true with the first release of the <a href="https://github.com/agg23/openfpga-SNES" title="https://github.com/agg23/openfpga-SNES">Super Nintendo core</a> for the Analogue Pocket. 3 years after its initial announcement, preorder, release, update, the Analogue Pocket had reached the potential that many of us initially saw in the device, and more.</p><p>[ photos ]</p><p>Actraiser looks and sounds absolutely stunning on the Pocket. Super Metroid looks and sounds amazing. It's all so beautiful.</p><div class='title'><b>A Dream Device</b></div><p>With both <b>Neo Geo</b> and <b>Super Nintendo</b> released, I'm able to play these games in the perfect environment without any of the problems of the Super Nintendo Mini. Adding and organizing games on the Pocket is FAR simpler than the Mini, and there is virtually no storage limit since everything is on an SD card. I'm able to play every game ever created on this device, and then organize the ones I want to play.</p><p>For me, there are still a few more consoles needed to make the Analogue Pocket the perfect device for me. Obviously, the <b>Nintendo Entertainment System</b> has an incredible number of classics, but I want to also play Sega Genesis with <b>Sega CD</b>, in order to play Snatcher, and <b>Capcom CPS2</b> for arcade perfect Street Fighter Alpha, Super Puzzle Fighter II, and some other amazing Shooters and Fighters.</p><p>If all <b>five</b> of these consoles were available on the Pocket, my Retro dreams would completely come true.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokemon Go Raid Counters" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old">Pokemon Go Raid Counters</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

These numbers of based on the calculations made by Gamepress’s <a href="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet" title="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet">Comprehensive DPS Spreadsheet</a> but put together on a single page, rather than multiple ones.</p><p><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general">General Raid Counter List</a></p><p class='img'><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0233.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0233.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0233.webp" /></a></p><p>It’s not the prettiest page, but it shows everything I need in order to build my raid team. Each cell shows the following:<br/>- the name of the Pokemon<br/>- the level of the Pokemon used for the calculations<br/>- the fast move<br/>- the charge move<br/>- the DPS<br/>- the TDO<br/>- the final figure is DPS*4 x TDO / 100000. This is the number I used to sort each list.</p><p>Doing more damage quickly is more important than staying alive, so I prioritize DPS. But, it’s not solely sorted by DPS because if you die immediately with no defense, it’s totally worthless.  Therefore, I’m using DPS*4 rather than DPS*3.</p><p>I’m including level 40 for all Pokemon, but I’m also including level 50 for all non-legendary pokemon and level 45 for all legendaries. It’s not too difficult to boost Pokemon up to level 40, but even though you can boost them all the way up to 50, getting XL candies for legendaries is not so easy. Includes two levels for each Pokemon can show you how much more powerful one is compared to the rest.</p><div class='title'><b>Purpose</b></div><p>For some quick background, in Pokemon Go, there are these Pokemon battles called raids that multiple people can join to defeat the boss. Once the boss is defeated, each player has a chance to catch that Pokemon for themselves. These Pokemon are strong enough that you cannot defeat them by yourself. Each boss is different, but you usually must have 3 or 4 players minimum to win, assuming they have the best Pokemon for the battle.</p><p>But what are the best Pokemon for the battle? A while ago, the Pokemon community on <b>Gamepress</b> wrote a calculator that would tell you just how powerful a Pokemon was versus a raid boss. If you typed in the Pokemon you wanted to fight, it would give you a numbered list of all the best pokemon you’d need to defeat it.</p><p>When I was first doing raids, I found this calculator very useful to determine which Pokemon to catch and boost. However, for this calculator, you need to type in each individual Pokemon one by one to see each of the best counters.  I wanted a page that I could look at and see ALL of the best pokemon versus ALL of the raid pokemon in Pokemon Go. So, I made one.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Raid Counter List</b></div><p>The calculator will save a CSV will all the data for the raid counters.  So, back in 2019, I made this page to display all the information from these CSV files. Over time, this became unmanageable because the number of raid bosses continued to grow and the number of best Pokemon and best moves began to grow too. It would take me about an hour to download each individual sheet.</p><p>The Gamepress Calculator does all of its calculations in JavaScript. So over summer, I went through that code and ported it to Java. Now, rather than compiling data from generated CSV files, I can generate that data myself. And, rather than downloading 30+ CSV files, I only need to download the raw data files and rerun the page.</p><p><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/general">General Raid Counter List</a></p><p>The General list says which are the best raid pokemon overall, but I also wrote a page that shows me which of my Pokemon are the best. I have to manually add every one of these, so my list is often out of date, but it gives me a general idea how much damage my team can do or how many people I’ll need to recruit to beat the boss.</p><p><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom">Personal Raid Counter List</a></p><p>I’m not sure if any of this is readable to anyone else, but it helps me out. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokemon Go Cards" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokemon-go-cards">Pokemon Go Cards</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 18, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Thanks to my Twitch channel, and the overall general rise and demand for all things video games on the Internet during the pandemic, I had been getting into Pokemon Cards lately. Not spending too much money, but maybe spending more money than I had to.</p><p>In March, it was announced that the Pokemon Card company would finally be doing a proper crossover with Pokemon Go. Generally, Pokemon card sets follow the main series of Pokemon games, such as X/Y, Sun/Moon, and Sword/Shield. Sometimes there would be novelty cards that would show up from other spin-off games, but no other spin-off game has been as popular as Pokemon Go.  In fact, the overall brand awareness of Pokemon increased significantly after the release of Pokemon Go in 2016, and it has stayed around the same ever since.</p><p>This new Pokemon Go set of Pokemon Cards would be an entire expansion of 72 cards, too. Previous novelty sets, like Detective Pikachu and the 25th Anniversary sets were only 20 or 25 cards, and these cards weren’t really all that useful passed their novelty. I don’t actually play the game, so I can’t say whether or not these Go cards are actually useful. But, it seems like they’ve put some actually work into them.</p><p>I was able to preorder a box of cards and the long box set from Pokemon Center online, so I got them in the mail as they released on Friday (June 17th). I was able to pick up a few more packs, plus the folder set from a convenience store on the way home after work.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1864.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1864.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1864_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1864_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1864_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The long box came with a photo frame to hold a card, and a card box that looked like an egg incubator from Pokemon Go. It had some packs of cards, too. The folder pack came with that little folder to hold some cards. It also came with a Pikachu promo card. It also got 5 other promo cards from buying a booster box.</p><p>Each booster pack comes with seven cards: a special flashy energy card with the Pokemon Go logo, an item/sticker promo card with a code for Pokemon Go, 2 or 3 common cards, 1 or 2 uncommon cards, and a rare pull. The rare pull could be a simple rare, a V card, V-star card, V-max card, or any other rare card in the set.  There are a total of 72 cards in the base set, but an additional 12 or 15 secret rare cards.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1860_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For my first pack, I really didn't get anything special. In this case, my rare card was a Gyarados denoted by the <b>R</b> next to the number at the bottom.</p><p>The promo code in Pokemon Go can give one of eight different sets of items. There are six common sets and one uncommon set of items with stickers, and there is one rare set which gives clothing for your character.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - 3 months later</I></b></div><p>As I streamed over the following weekends, I opened up some packs for my followers. Immediately, I started getting some good pulls, like the shiny Venusaur and Dragonite V-star card. As my streams continued, I started getting some other good stuff too, like the shiny Blastoise, Mewtwo V-star, and a full art Candela.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1879.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1879.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1879_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1879_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1879_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1865.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1865_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1865_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/IMG_1865_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I was getting very few duplicates of rare and uncommon cards.</p><p>A few weeks later, I had opened up all my packs of cards and was only missing 8 from the base set. Each pack of cards gave a chance to pull a rare card, and those were the 8 that I was missing. Obviously, I could buy more packs for more chances, but it is way more cost effective to just buy what I needed.</p><p>Cards weren't too expensive, and I was able to quickly get most of them from Yahoo Auctions, except for one. Within the base set of 72 cards, the most expensive card was Shiny Charizard. My auctions were selling the card for $40, which was way too much for me to spend.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update 2</I></b></div><p>Fast forward six more months and the Shiny Charizard was now only $10 on Yahoo Auctions. I am totally fine with spending $10 on a single Pokemon card as it was the ONE piece remaining from my collection.</p><p>Now my collection is complete!</p><p>Click the photo below to see the whole set, or individual pages in the gallery.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/20230310203705-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/20230310203705-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/20230310203705-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/20230310203705-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220618_pokecards/20230310203705-full_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b><I>Update 3</I></b></div><p>With prices for cards in the Pokemon Go decreasing, I started looking into other cards I might want to pick up.

| April 2, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the main goals of Pokemon is to catch every species of Pokemon available. I've talked about this before in my post about the <a href="/old/v7/completing-the-national-pokedex" title="/completing-the-national-pokedex">National Pokedex</a>. But, it's possible to take this a step further. These days, for every Pokemon, there is a 1 in 4096 chance that it will be <b>Shiny</b>. A Shiny pokemon is a rare variant that appears in a different color. </p><p>Recent Pokemon Games have had methods of increasing the odds of getting a Shiny Pokemon. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I've been streaming video games on Twitch. And, in particular, I've been streaming hunts of Shiny Pokemon through these methods. When streaming on Twitch, I have HTML overlays in OBS that shows my progress of catching all Shiny Pokemon in the game, so I can keep track of what I have left to catch.</p><p>I've been streaming Shiny Hunts in <b>Let's Go Eevee</b>, and recently with the release of the excellent <b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b>. Additionally, <b>Pokemon Go</b> makes it VERY easy to catch Shiny Pokemon. Not only is there is an increased base Shiny catch rate of 1 in 512, but often there are events that increase the odds as much as 1 in 20. So, I made a similar list to track my Shiny progress there, too.</p><p>You can view copies of these lists from the following links:</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><b>Pokemon Let's Go Eevee</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo">Shiny Completion List</a></div><div class="column"><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/dex" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/dex">Shiny Completion List</a><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/order" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/order">Shiny Catches</a><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/missing" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/hisui/missing">Remaining Shiny Pokemon</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><b>Pokemon Go</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/go" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/go">Shiny Completion List</a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>With all these lists keeping track of Shiny Pokemon, I was curious about my Shiny Progress across all Pokemon games. I have caught a few Shiny Pokemon in the main games, too, through events and randomly (though, rarely) in the wild. Combining all the counts from the above lists and the main games, I made an overall Shiny list.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column">&nbsp;</div><div class="column"><b>All Games Combined</b><br/><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex">Overall Shiny Completion List</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast">&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>These lists are mostly up to date, but because I am manually entering data, it's really easy for them to get out of date. The index page for all of these lists has the date of when they were last updated.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column">&nbsp;</div><div class="column"><a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon">Shiny Pokemon Index Page</a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast">&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Also, all of these lists are part of the schlock-bot project in git-hub.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's Go Eevee</b></div><p>I became interested in Shiny Hunting thanks to Let's Go. While watching various YouTube videos during the pandemic, one video showed that you could find a Shiny in about 20 minutes by catching the same Pokemon over and over again. I tried it out, and it worked! I caught my first Shiny Magikarp.</p><p>In Let's Go, you can increase your chances of getting a Shiny by doing three things. One, when you complete the Pokedex, you'll get a Shiny Charm. This will give you 2 extra chances for a Shiny. Two, when you use a Lure in the game, it'll give you 1 extra chance. And Three, the biggest one, when you catch the same Pokemon, you build a Catch Combo. When that combo reaches 31 and above, you'll get 11 extra chances for a Shiny. With all three combined, this gives 15 chances out of 4096, the equivalent to 1 in about 274.</p><p>It was incredibly satisfying to start up a stream, and usually have a shiny appear once every hour. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032217392600_s.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2021032617270200_s.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>While streaming, I would record my shiny catches using <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">schlock-bot</a>, and use that <a href="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo" title="https://theschlock.com/pokemon/shinydex/letsgo">above overlay</a> to display my progress.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b></div><p>I am in absolute love with Pokemon Legends Arceus. Since its release two months ago, I've been streaming the game, and shiny hunting has been pretty easy.</p><p>Much like Let's Go, there are several methods of increasing chances for Shiny pokemon to appear. One, the Shiny Charm will give 3 extra chances this time. Two, the overall goal of the game is to complete the Pokedex. You do this by more than just catching Pokemon, though. If you complete an entry, you'll get 1 extra roll. But, if you perfect the entry, you'll get another 2 extra rolls. With all of these combined, you'll 7 chances out of 4096, the equivalent of 1 in about 586.  Just in the wild!</p><p>Additionally, there are Mass Outbreaks and Massive Mass Outbreaks of Pokemon. Including all of the above, Pokemon in mass outbreaks have a Shiny chance of 1 in about 128! In Massive Mass Outbreaks, chances are 1 in about 216. These chances are even better than Let's Go!</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032610550500_s.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220402_shiny_pokemon/2022032615273500_s.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Pokemon Legends is my favorite Pokemon game of all time, it is incredibly satisfying to fly around and collect Shiny Pokemon. Much like Let's Go, I recorded my shiny catches using <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">schlock-bot</a>, which updated the above display lists.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Go and Others</b></div><p>People have been Shiny Hunting on Twitch and YouTube forever, but I don't think it became mainstream and accessible until Pokemon Go. As mentioned above, the overall base Shiny rate is increased to 1 in 512. I think this was their incentive to keep people playing because if you play for 3-4 hours straight in a day, you have a pretty high chance of finding a Shiny pokemon. </p><p>Furthermore, Pokemon Go often has events that make Shiny hunting easier. One way is increasing the spawns of particular rare Pokemon, which gives you more to catch and more chance for a Shiny to appear. Another way is increasing the base odds of a Shiny appearing. The most common of these events is the Community Day, which boosts the odds up to 1 in 20! You are virtually guaranteed to catch several during the event!</p><p>Because of Pokemon Go, I think Game Freak has made Shiny hunting more accessible in the main games, too. Also with Pokemon spawning in the overworld (instead of random battles), you can easily see whether a Pokemon is Shiny. You can check WAY MORE pokemon these days than you could before.</p><p>In my free time, I still stream on Twitch, and usually I'm playing Pokemon. So, feel free to stop by and say hi!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Most Played Games in 2021" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/most-played-games-2021">Most Played Games in 2021</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I had already streamed some Playstation games using the native share method, but I wanted to stream Switch games, too.</p><p>I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer external capture card (after the Elgato one didn't work) and it worked pretty proficiently. OBS uses a lot of power when running, so I have to limit my streams to 720p or else the battery can't charge itself fast enough from all the power usage.</p><p>I streamed Let's Go Eevee almost daily for multiple hours. Unfortunately, Nintendo did not release end of the year stats as they did for previous years. :(</p><p>In July, I was finally able to order a Playstation 5. I had tried getting one in Japan, but there were so few shipments and retailers had many weird hoops to go through to get one. I got mine directly through Sony online in America, so I had my mom ship it to me, which was a little expensive. :( </p><div class='title'><b>Playstation</b></div><p>With a Playstation 5, I started playing some more games on stream rather than just Pokemon. Although, every game I played was an enhanced version of a Playstation 4 game (or simply a Playstation 4 game). <b>Final Fantasy VII Remake</b> got a PS5 version. <b>Death Stranding</b> got a PS5 version.</p><p>The first game I played through on stream was <b>Control</b>, a some cerebral action-adventure set in a retro corporate setting. You play as Jesse, who is appointed as the new director of the FBC, and you tear through the depths of the vast headquarters looking for your brother and the secrets of the organization. It was neat, and free with PSN from a few months prior.</p><p>My absolute favorite game of the year was <b>Outer Wilds</b>. It's a very simple game where you play as an alien species on a small world. The sun will go super nova at the end of the day, and you explore all the planets and other locations of your solar system to discover the ancient history of your species, as well as find a way for life to survive the super nova. It's an incredible experience where you are given the tiniest spec of a hint at the beginning of what to do, and from there, everything is found through your own exploration and experimentation.</p><p>Anyways, here are my stats:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Even though Nintendo did not release play stats for the Switch, with the termination of the Wii U and 3DS online services, Nintendo did make a webpage where you could see your lifetime stats from both platforms.</p><p>Compared to the 900 hours I played on my Nintendo Switch last year, 1102 lifetime hours on the 3DS seems a bit low.

| December 12, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Unown is a Pokemon from Gold/Silver that has 28 different forms. Each form is a letter of the alphabet, plus a question mark and exclamation point. Unown is special because it was originally only available at physical events. And at those events, only specific letters were available. Over time, it's become easier to catch at least one form of Unown, but certain letters have only been available a few times.</p><p>So, which letters are the most common? Which ones are rare? And where have they been released?</p><p>I've been keeping track on this page: <b><a href="/apps/pokemon/unown" title="/apps/pokemon/unown">/apps/pokemon/unown</a></b></p><p>This page shows the data in 4 ways:<br/>1. It shows which ones I'm missing and which events they were available at.<br/>2. It shows an ascending list of the rarest Unowns and their events from the last 3 years.<br/>3. It shows an ordered list of how many times each Letter has been available, and which events.<br/>4. And, it shows each individual event where Unown had been available, and which ones were there.</p><p>I use this page to determine whether or not I should throw away some Unown after I catch them. If I go to an event in Japan, and a particular form appears that has not appeared back in the US, I'll hold on to more than usual so I can trade with people.</p><p>The Exclamation Point, for example, was available at Go Fest in 2019, but has not been available since.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/211212_pokemon/IMG_0241_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to New Pokemon Snap" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokemon Snap</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 16, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the most beloved and revered spinoffs of Pokemon is Pokemon Snap for Nintendo 64. The idea of roaming around in a land while wild Pokemon "naturally" interact with each other and the environment has always given reality to people's imagination of how the real world of Pokemon could be.</p><p>For years, people have always said that they should make a modern update to Pokemon Snap and they finally did. Release on April 30th, <b>New</b> Pokemon Snap is the modern update every one had been asking for.</p><p>Back on the Nintendo 64, only 151 Pokemon were available, but 20 years later, there are now over 900 Pokemon. This game doesn't have all 900, but it has an incredibly balanced variety of Pokemon from all the different generations. It's pretty amazing how much New Pokemon Snap doesn't focus on just one generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>New Pokemon Snap plays almost identically to the original. You character hops into a pod and is pulled through the world on a mostly linear track. Your job is to take photos of Pokemon that appear in the environment. </p><p>Through the game, you unlock some ways to interact with the Pokemon. In New Pokemon Snap, you can throw out food for them to eat, throw orbs to light up pokemon, and play music. These interactions can change the course of your pod, or unlock other things.</p><p>Expanded from the original is the possibility of different tiered photographs. Depending on the interactions you before with Pokemon, they could perform a unique pose or even a special pose.  Every Pokemon now has 4 level of photographs to be taken. Tier 1 is a stand photo and Tier 2 is typically the Pokemon eating food. Tier 3 and Tier 4 are reserved for unique poses</p><p>With 200 total Pokemon in the game and each Pokemon having 2 unique poses, that's 400 unique photographs you need to take. It is a bit overwhelming, especially towards the end of the game when you're missing many of these photos. When you only get 1 or 2 new photos in a single run, it gets VERY repetitive and VERY boring quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>High Score</b></div><p>All photos in the game give you a score. If you get a "perfect" photo, it'll be worth 4000 or more points. All of these points add up to the total score of your Photodex. Pokemon Snap came out right at the beginning of Golden Week, so I had an entire week off from work to devote to this game. I was playing this game almost every day for HOURS after its release, so I was flying through the game.</p><p>Additionally, you can connect online and compare your Photodex score to everyone in the world. At my peak, I was able to become nearly 800th place in the world.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I could not keep up this pace forever. Vacation had finished, and I had to get back to work. Everyone else in the world who played video game for a living continue on without me.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnout</b></div><p>As mentioned above, once you do the broad strokes of everything in the game, all that is left is grinding. Finding all of the remaining photos, one by one. Slowly increasing the scores of your photos, one by one. Doing the same tracks, again and again and again. </p><p>There's not really much skill involved with the game. You wait 5 minutes to get the perfect photo, and if you miss it by a fraction of a second, you gotta do it again.  You try to get Pokemon to do what you want, but it occasionally goes wrong, and gets frustrating.</p><p>Eh, there's really no reason to push myself too hard in this game just to build my hatred for it. It's a good game and I like it, otherwise.</p><p>So, I put the game down. Here are my final stats in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it's a fun game with a lot of stuff to do. The Pokemon interactions are fun and interesting. Plenty of Easter eggs and hidden interactions to find that are really satisfying when you naturally find them.  Definitely worthy of the Pokemon Snap name. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock Bot" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 8, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>With the world in lockdown, late last year I decided to look into what it would take to start streaming video games on the Internet. I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer from Amazon, and after a lot of tweaks, I have my stream running pretty well through OBS and broadcasting to Twitch. I've had a small following, too, so I've made a Discord to chat with people while I'm not streaming.</p><p>You can find me on Twitch here: <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock" title="https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock">https://www.twitch.tv/dyreschlock</a><br/>You can join my Discord here: <a href="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK" title="https://discord.gg/7GZ7xdR5yK">https://discord.gg/...</a></p><p>These days I've been playing a lot of Let's Go Eevee on stream. In each stream, I hunt for Shiny pokemon and eventually I plan on collecting all of them. In order to make my streams more engaging, I have created a Chat Bot that has various games and activities. This is <b>Schock Bot</b>.</p><p>Schlock Bot is a locally run program. When it is active, it'll connect to Twitch and Discord. It will read every message in the Twitch chat and every message in the Bot channel on Discord. If a command appears, it will respond. It is written in Java with connections to MySQL. Recently, I retro-fitted Tapestry into it, so it will also host webpages, which I use as Twitch overlays.</p><p>On Git-hub, you can view all the current functionality and how to use it. For Twitch Chat, its main function is taking bets on which Shiny Pokemon will appear next in Let's Go. Also, there's a guessing game, which will give the Chat hints on a Pokemon. The first one to guess will get points!</p><p>You can view the entire project here: <a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot">https://github.com/dyreschlock/schlock-bot</a></p><p>It's been really fun getting back into programming. It is really satisfying that while building this thing everything really came together. And then being able to use it immediately on stream and have real people interact with it. It's great. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Plans</b></div><p>Rock blocks are always what slows down progress and kills motivation, though. Nearly everything I've been able to think of, I've been able to put into this, but there are 2 major things I wish to add that have not been working.</p><p><b>One</b>, I want to be able to listen for Channel Points redemptions and other Twitch notifications. Apparently you do this through Web hooks, but I haven't been able to get it working. With this working, I could automate a few things in the background rather than doing it manually.</p><p><b>Two</b>, I have Schlock Bot hosting web pages, which are connected in Twitch and displayed. But, again, I'm manually turning on and off their visibility. I want to make a host of other webpages that show the most recent followers and display graphics or play sound effects. I'm having trouble getting these pages working. There would need to be some kind of Ajax thing that would listen for a prompt, and then react accordingly.</p><p>With both of these things working, viewers could redeem points and have graphics show up on my stream or have a sound effect play.  Ya know, just like all the other obnoxious streamers.  Some day, this'll happen.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Most Played Games in 2020" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/most-played-games-2020">Most Played Games in 2020</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
