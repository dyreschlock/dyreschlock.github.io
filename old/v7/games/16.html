| August 1, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Man, Soul Caliber really brings me back almost 9 years ago to the Dreamcast release of 9/9/99.  The first exposure I had with Soul Caliber was setting up all the playable Dreamcast kiosks in Toys R Us.  2 were setup with our pre-release copy of Sonic Adventure, and I setup a third with Soul Caliber because everyone in the store wanted to play it.</p><p>I turned on the TV and the Dreamcast, the little orange dot danced around the screen and painted the curly Dreamcast logo, and the opening cinema began.  The camera flying across the dusty ground with weapons piercing the land.  It was the most graphically impressive things I'd ever seen.  At that point, Final Fantasy VIII's cinemas were the best thing I'd seen, but those were all pre-rendered.  Soul Caliber was ALL real time and was much faster and shinier than those FFVIII cutscenes.</p><p>I instantly liked Soul Caliber, but I didn't fall in love until March the next year when I actually bought a Dreamcast and had my own copy of Soul Caliber.  I was pretty good at it. ^_^  I was able to completely trampled my casual-gaming friends and hold my own against my hardcore-gaming friends.  It was a head-to-head competitive game that everyone played and everyone had in common.  When visiting someone or them visiting me, Soul Caliber would also find itself into the visit.  Even later on, once I started college, we always came back to Soul Caliber.  It was a staple in fighting game nights.</p><p>I did go back to check out Soul Edge, but it didn't have the magic of Soul Caliber.  Soul Caliber was fast and had tons of Single Player modes.</p><p>I was super excited when Namco announced Soul Caliber II, and EVEN more ecstatic when Link was announced as a playable character!  I would look at <a xhref="http://www.the-magicbox.com/" title="http://www.the-magicbox.com/"The Magic Box</a> and <a xhref="http://watch.impress.co.jp/game/" title="http://watch.impress.co.jp/game/">Game Watch</a> every single day hoping for new information and whenever something came up, I would summarize the info on the SPAMM forum.  What characters were announced, which characters were returning, which were new.</p><p>In March 2003, I bought the import copy of Soul Caliber II on Gamecube.  I played it a bit, but no one really seemed to care.  It didn't have the caliber of the previous version since it was spread across all 3 consoles, Gamecube, Playstation 2 and Xbox.  People bickered which version was the true version.  People banned the console-specific characters because they were over-powered.  The Soul Caliber community no longer had the unity that brought them together in the beginning.</p><p>Soul Caliber III was lost in the fold for me.  It was only on Playstation 2, but it didn't have the arcade release to fine-tune the console release.  It was the first Soul Caliber to be released on a console ahead of the arcade game, and that just felt completely wrong to me.  It felt like an untuned, unrefined Soul Caliber game..  Not really the next step in the Soul Caliber series.  I've only played it once to this day, but I was happy that I could still hold my own with Kilik. ^_^</p><p><b>This week</b>, Soul Caliber IV comes to the next-gen Consoles with console-specific characters, once again.  I really didn't care about this at all, but after thinking back on my fond Soul Caliber memories.  I kinda want to get into it again.  Soul Caliber IV feels like a leap for the series into the HD era, so I kinda want to be a part of Soul Caliber again.</p><p>However, there's plenty of reasons that keep me from buying it.  First Off, which one do I buy?  I'd almost rather get the Playstation 3 game.  But, if any of my friends get it, they'll probably get the Xbox version and I wouldn't be able to play against them online.  Second Off, it's 60 friggen dollars.  Soul Caliber may have been my go to game in the past, but I doubt I'm going to play it more than 30 minutes without turning it off for something else.</p><p>The character creator sounds fun, but probably won't keep my interest.  I bought that Spore Creature Creator, but felt overwhelmed.  There was too much to do in there, and I couldn't get my creature to look like what I wanted.</p><p>Overall, Soul Caliber is my favorite fighting game of all time, but my history with it is in the past.  I dunno...  is anyone else going to buy Soul Caliber III on Playstation 3?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MGS4 Development" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mgs4-development">MGS4 Development</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I bought something rather frivolous.  When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Free-Running Game" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/free-running-game">Free-Running Game</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Despite all its flaws, Assassin's Creed is incredibly fun because of it's Free-Running.  It's a shame that all the missions and story elements slow the overall experience rather than strengthen it.  The speed reminds me a little bit of Burnout Paradise where you'll make an infinite amount of mistakes that will slow your progress, but in time you'll learn your location and begin to use it to your advantage.</p><p>I almost wish that there was a Free-Running racing game in the works.  You'd think Sega would've done an incredible Sonic the Hedgehog game by now, but... you'd be dead wrong.</p><p>All this Free-Running in the ancient world has got me even more excited for the upcoming game entitled <b>Mirror's Edge</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>First Contact</b></div><p><b>Mirror's Edge</b> is a 1st person free-running game that reminds me a lot of The Matrix, Portal, and Oni.  I first came across this game when GameGirl.com did a <a href="http://www.gamegirl.com/article/79313/mirrors-edge-preview/" title="http://www.gamegirl.com/article/79313/mirrors-edge-preview/">feature</a>.  The initial trailer looked stunning.</p><p><b>Trailer 1</b>: <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/33586.html" title="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/33586.html">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/33586.html</a></p><p>You play as Faith, a message courier in a world ruled by Police and controlled information.  As a Courier your duty is to transport messages from point A to point B without being caught and keep information free.</p><p>Despite being developed by DICE, known for Battlefield 1942 and subsequent games, the focus is completely on movement and your character.  As the GameGirl preview says, Carrying a weapon only slows you down so you'll have to make decisions whether or not you'll need a gun.</p><div class='title'><b>This week</b></div><p>With E3 in full swing, everyone has gotten the chance to play Mirror's Edge and everyone sounds quite positive about it.  When playing the game, you have to overcome your own paradigm of how far you can jump and what you can do and begin thinking in terms of the character and what she can do, how far she can jump, and so forth.</p><p>Here's someone running through the demo: <a href="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19944" title="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19944">http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19944</a><br/>(via <a href="http://kotaku.com/5025214/mirrors-edge-e3-demonstration" title="http://kotaku.com/5025214/mirrors-edge-e3-demonstration">kotaku</a>)</p><p>As you can see, it's the exactly same scenario as the previous trailer except now you have someone demostrating it, rather than someone going through it perfectly.</p><p>Jeff Green of GFW was saying that designers had designed the levels in such a way that when you first go through them, you're basically finding any way to the end.  The put easy ramps and jumps in places that you can naturally find.  But once you've gone through the game a bit further and get more familiar with what Faith can do, when you go back to the original levels you'll start to see more short cuts.  The game is kinda designed for speed runs and time trials.</p><p>One huge concern that people are having about this game is the obvious motion sickness and vertigo created by the constant movement and high altitude leaps.  Joystiq has an <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/17/how-mirrors-edge-fights-simulation-sickness/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/17/how-mirrors-edge-fights-simulation-sickness/">article</a> that explains how they overcome this.  Omitted from the trailers and a single blue dot as a focal point in the center of the screen which the player can use to center themselves.  The designers came across this technique from interviewing ballerinas about how they perform spins without feeling sick.  The trick is to focus on a single point.</p><p>Along with the demo, comes another spiffy trailer: <a href="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19906" title="http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19906">http://www.gamevideos.com/video/id/19906</a></p><div class='title'><b>I'm probably sold</b></div><p>The game looks sweet by I have some concerns about length of game and story.  Honestly, if the gameplay is fantastic, who cares about story.  Just as long as the story either heightens the gameplay or stays completely out of the way, I'll be fine with it.  From the demo above, it seems that the story won't be too annoying.  That scripted event at the end was kinda dumb though.</p><p>The length of the game is a concern because I don't want to pay $60 for 6 or 7 levels the same size as that demo.  I want a bunch of levels that are very unique in location from each other and offer a variety of puzzles rather than the same thing over and over again.  From impressions I've heard, it sounds like it has the variety, but I'm still concerned on the length.</p><p>So, If I were to buy the game, the question comes down to what platform do I purchase Mirror's Edge for?  Well, DICE is a PC game developer, so the lead platform has got to be windows based.  I'm thinking they'll be more concerned with that crowd over the Playstation 3, so that leaves Windows v. Xbox.  Pfft, obviously there's no way my computer is going to run this thing without crashing, so I guess I'll pick it up on Xbox.</p><p>The other little incentive to actually buying the game rather than waiting or renting it is that Gamestop is offering Faith's messenger bag as a pre-order bonus!  (via <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/09/pre-order-mirrors-edge-and-its-in-the-bag/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2008/07/09/pre-order-mirrors-edge-and-its-in-the-bag/">joystiq</a>): Available <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?Product_ID=70962" title="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?Product_ID=70962">here</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/MirrorsEdgePreOrderRunnerBag.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/MirrorsEdgePreOrderRunnerBag.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/MirrorsEdgePreOrderRunnerBag.webp" /></p><p>It looks like a very nice piece of video game swag and hides it's geeky nature quite well.  I've already got a spiffy laptop bag though, along with a secondary backpack.  I'm afraid I have no use for this thing other thing putting it in my closet next to my Adobe Max laptop bag and NFJS backpack laptop bag.</p><p>Perhaps I'll without judgment until PAX when it'll probably be on the show floor there and I can actually play it for myself.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Assassin's Creed Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/assassins-creed-impressions">Assassin's Creed Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Assassin's Creed is pretty neat, but incredibly repetitive.</p><div class='title'><b>It's neat</b></div><p>It's neat because it takes a fast paced approach to Stealth killing, compared to Metal Gear Solid and Tenchu which believe that patience is your number one weapon when killing unnoticed.  The fast paced nature comes from the Free Running style of gameplay.  Just hold down the run button and the sprint button, and off you go.  You can run up to a wall to scale it, climb on top, and then jump from roof top to roof top.</p><p>It's also neat because of the incredible scale of the cities you're free running through.  When perched on top of a tower, you can see all the buildings of the entire city.  Then you can crawl back down the tower, hop along a bunch of roof tops to the next tower, climb to the top and actually feel like you've covered a significant amount of ground.</p><p>It's also neat because with this scale, comes crowds and crowds of people.  So many people that it can become difficult to run through the streets.  You'll either need to start knocking everybody down as you bolt through them or get knocked over yourself.</p><div class='title'><b>Scale and Speed</b></div><p>The sense of the scale and speed are the greatest accomplishments of the game I've experience so far, but with scale comes the question of how you fill it?  You need a lot of stuff to make these cities feel alive, and the best way to make 10 people look like 100 is to copy and paste 10 times.  Recycle models, assets, textures and place everything in the world randomly, but come back afterwards and start molding it so it actually works.</p><p>The physics and gameplay engine are KEY for creating a game like this.  The gameplay needs to be absolutely flexible to operate correctly no matter what is actually in the environment.  Back at PAX last year, when the lead designer was demoing Assassin's Creed, he said that that was exactly their goal.  He pulled out his dev kit and set up a bunch of objects in the environment for Altier to run across and jump around on.  It was pretty fluid, like the environment was pre-setup.  But then he started moving around a bunch of the objects put them in places where Altier obviously couldn't move the same way as before.  He ran Altier through the objects again, and he acted completely different, but still completely fluid.</p><p>That's a lot of how Assassin's Creed feels when you're running across the roof tops.  You look to your left and right and look for little foot holds or nearby roof tops to jump across to.  It doesn't take long for you to figure out just how far Altier can jump and what makes sense to latch on to.  It's really fun ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Over and over again</b></div><p>Each city feels like it's been setup in certain areas, but all the recycled textures and models make me feel like I'm walking through the set of a Flintstones cartoon.  There's that guy again..  Oh! There's that doorway again.  Thank GOD you have a radar you can set waypoints onto.</p><p>On top of that, you have about 20 or 30 tasks to do per mission, which limit themselves to either helping Citizens from bully guards, pickpocketing, eavesdropping or intimidating.  Once you do all the tasks, you bring your information to the local guild and he tells you where to assassinate your target.  You go there, kill him, return to the guild and mission complete.  Then you get to do it ALL OVER AGAIN.  Rinse and repeat.</p><p>I've spent 5 hours rescuing stupid citizens and gazing from towers and hardly anytime actually assassinating worth-while targets.  I'm more focused on the grueling tasks ahead of me than any amount of story.</p><div class='title'><b>Story Telling</b></div><p>And the story telling is crap because you aren't actually Altier.  All this running around killing people is completely senseless and meaningless because in the overall plotline it is wholly unimportant.  You're actually a guy named Desmond, who is the great-graet-great-etg-earg-erae-fga-g-grandson of Altier and you relive moments of your grand pappy's life through inherited memories.</p><p>The real question of the game is why do I give two shits about Altier.  They mention that to get to the useful memories of Altier you have to start at the beginning, but seriously?! can't we just skip through all the piece of crap side missions which are the same as all the other side missions where are the same as the ACTUAL missions.  Where's the fast forward button? ..</p><p>In the 5 hours I've been playing so far, I've had about 30 minutes of story outside of Altier and as Desmond and I'm so bored, I'd rather be beating up people in the past.  They have given me absolutely no incentive to care about anything that's going on.  Even though the "Desmond goes to the Past" thing is a clear rip-off of LOST.</p><div class='title'><b>Why?</b></div><p>Why am I playing this game?  Why should I care about Desmond?  Running around through the streets and roof tops is neat.  Looking off in the distance over a massive city that I can walk every inch of is neat.  But adding those two things together is a gameplay concept, not a game.  This story is going no where fast... How long is this game anyways?  When can I quit?</p><p>Also, I like pushing over ladies with pots on their heads.  I also like punching bums right in the jaw when they ask me for change.  It's a lot of fun messing with the AI in this game because they just can't win.  Pots?  That's a pushin'  Change? That's a stabbin'<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to It's all melting around me" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me">It's all melting around me</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 15, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the mail today, Netflix graciously delivered <b>House of Wax</b>.  That 2006 piece of shit horror movie with Paris Hilton and a supporting actress.  I'm not really sure how it snuck itself all the way to first place in my queue, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through the entire thing.  To be fair, I did have the things on 1.5x Play to make sure I only wasted an hour, rather than an hour and a half.</p><p>My expectations were pretty simple..  I knew this film was garbage.  I expected garbage.  But House of Wax still managed to disappoint me and fail my expectations.</p><p>Though it did not fail my expectations as badly as Nintendo and Sony had today.  For this week is E3, the Electronics Entertainment Expo is Los Angeles.  The event that has set itself as a milestone in game development and allows companies to show what they have accomplished and what big things they have in store for gamers in the coming fall and Christmas season.</p><p>Yesterday, Microsoft had some great announcements such as a new 60 gb Xbox 360 coming out in a couple of weeks to replace the 20gb.  The harddrive expansion should help out a bit since another announcement was that you can install full Xbox 360 games onto your harddrive for far faster loading.  EVEN bigger news was that Microsoft has teamed with Netflix to stream "Watch Instantly" titles directly to your Xbox 360 if you have a Netflix subscription and an xbox live gold subscription.</p><p>They also showed off some of there games namely <b>Gears of War 2</b> (dumb) and <b>Fable 2</b> (sweet!) and ended their conference announcing that Final Fantasy XIII will be coming to the Xbox 360 in America.  This news literally broke some corners of the internet..  namely neogaf.  Squaresoft held a Q&A session afterward where everyone wanted to know the details.</p><p>The Xbox is looking quite lucrative..  Even before the conference, Fable 2 was really the only next-gen game that interested me this Fall and with the Netflix integration and new 60gb models, I'll be in line that mid-August morning to pick one up.  Hopefully there'll be some sort of sale..</p><p>That's fine for the Xbox though, but I'm MORE interested in the game consoles I own.  I've owned a Wii for well over a year now, and in the last 3 months I haven't even touched it.  There's nothing on the Wii I want to play right now, and nothing down the pipeline either.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same is with the Playstation 3.  I bought that thing about a month ago, loved Metal Gear Solid 4 to death, and now all I do with it is play DVDs and Blurays.  There's nothing on the Playstation 3 coming down the pipeline I want that I wouldn't have a better time with on the 360.  Any multi-platform titles that has a smidgen of Online functionality, I will choose the Xbox version because I have MORE friends with Xboxes and it's MUCH easier to join games with them.  <b>Ghostbusters</b> has Online co-op?  Xbox purchase.  <b>Resident Evil 5</b> has Online Co-op?  Most likely Xbox purchase.</p><p>SO, that made me quite excited for this morning when Nintendo and Sony had their E3 press conferences and I feverishly waited for a megaton announcement to rival the Final Fantasy XIII on Xbox announcement yesterday.  In fact, I popped up the live video to listen to while I worked rather than just looking at the news pouring in from sites.</p><p>The first conference of the day was Nintendo.  They showed off a snowboarding game with the Wii Balance Board, then<b> Animal Crossing</b>, then some DS games..  Then they showed off <b>Wii Sports Resort</b> (Wii Sports 2), which I thought was pretty damn important for them.  It'll definitely sell a ton of copies since everyone knows and loves Wii Sports.  I was somewhat excited for them, but for me..  who cares?  It's just another collection of Wii mini-games to go along with all the other top-selling games on the Wii.  Then they announced <b>Wii Music</b>, which was laughable.</p><p>And that was it...  Iwata mentioned that the Zelda and Mario teams are hard at work on new Wii titles, but gave absolutely no hint as to what those titles are, nor when we know of them.  All the games shown for Wii were more crappy mini-game compliations and Animal Crossing, which is an MMO chat room furniture collection game I've already played to death on the gamecube.  Frakking bullshit.</p><p>I shrugged it off though..  my Wii is kinda broken now anyways, and my monitor only accepts digital signals, so the Wii looks like crap on it.  I've been setting my sights on HiDef gaming more recently so bring on the good news Sony!</p><p>Nearly 2 hours later, the Sony conference began and I sat listening to Jack Trenton talk and talk and talk.  <b>Yakuza 2</b> (on PS2) got a little face time in the Playstation 2 trailer, which made me happy.  That's another game coming out this fall that I've been waiting for.  Trenton unveiled PSN movie rentals which was the biggest joke after Microsoft announced its Netflix partnership the day earlier.</p><p>He also announced that they have 130 titles coming to PS2 by the end of the year...  That's a lot more than they have for the Playstation 3.  Obviously the Playstation 2 has a huge attach rate, but it's time to move on.  Focus on the Playstation 3 because the Xbox hit 5 or 6 home runs just yesterday, not to mention all the blockbuster releases last year.  Metal Gear is all you have going for you and Microsoft has shown that it doesn't need it.</p><p>An hour into the conference and they finally get to showing off the upcoming games for Playstation 3.  Sony officially announces God of War 3 (boring), they show off some other game, and unveil MAG, a 256 player war simulator.  Another fucking war game...  and that's the show.</p><p>Once again, absolutely nothing that appeals to me at all..  No immersive single player experience that will have me loving video games the way Twilight Princess, Mario Galaxy and Metal Gear Solid 4 have.  Resident Evil 5 will probably fill that bill, but Sony didn't give any face time to it.  Microsoft showed off a demo and gave a March 13th, 2009 date AND announced online co-op.</p><p>The future is grim for my interest in these two consoles in the next year.  There's still whatever game the Zelda and Mario teams are working on for the Wii (<b>Kid Icarus</b>).  And there's <b>Yakuza Kenzan</b> and <b>Yakuza 3</b> for Playstation 3, but haven't been announced for an American release.</p><p>The Xbox has Fable 2 coming out in October, and huge multi-million-dollar-deal DLC for Grand Theft Auto 4.  Probably some Mass Effect DLC once Bioware finishes Dragon Age.  There's also Galaga Legions from the creators of Pacman CE.  AND Online Co-op for Ghostbusters with friends!</p><p>I really feel that once I actually get an Xbox, my other two consoles will just sit there, against the wall.. especially the Wii.  The Playstation 3 I'll use for Blu-ray and upscaling Playstation 2 games.</p><p>There's not a whole lot of redeeming qualities..  much like House of Wax.  For a horror movie, there's NO nudity.. what the crap?!  The acting goes from bad to worse to slap-in-the-face horrible.  However, in the end, the main characters set the House of Wax on fire and frantically escape as it turns into a boiling molten pit of fire and craziness.  Also, Paris Hilton dies.  House of Wax will always have that over the Nintendo and Sony conferences.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metal Gear Solid 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metal-gear-solid-4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 14, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over a month ago, Metal Gear Solid 4 was release on the Playstation and over a month ago, I played the crap out of it.  I stood outside Wal*mart early in the morning and spent the $500 entry fee for a Playstation 3 and a copy of Metal Gear.  I played a little bit in the evening after work, but on that Saturday afternoon, I picked up the controller, and didn't set it down until I finished it the next day.  I was on my seat the whole time.  I was careful, but still raced through the gameplay to watch the next cutscene.  I had to see what happened next.</p><p>So far in this generation, I haven't felt anything this.  Every game I have liked on the Xbox may have had a decent story, but the characters are all so flat and vacant.  There's no emotional appeal what-so-ever.  You kill a bunch of enemies and the story progresses, but your character never explains how he feels about it.  You never show any weakness or compassion. Enemies are merely obstacles, gameplay elements, something to do until you see what happens next..  rather than seeing how your characters will react to what happens next.</p><p>The first bit of the game shows off the next gen nature of Metal Gear 4.  It pulls in new concepts of the series and sets the stage and themes Hideo Kojima wants to make with his game.  War is ugly and the only thing pushing War is the war economy.  Nations thrive from war and it's become a way of life for some people.</p><p>The overall story in Metal Gear Solid 4 is a very human tale.  Though, it does have its fair share of ridiculousness.  Metal Gear Solid is quite serious in the themes it presents, but once the game drifts from it's commentary on modern warfare to the actual plot of the Metal Gear series, little bits of crazy start seeping into the frame work.  Metal Gear starts off as one game and becomes another.</p><p>It becomes the absolute climax of Solid Snake's story bringing up points from Snake's past and MY own past playing Snake in the previous 3 games.  Remember when you did this?  It's relevant because of this.  Remember this person you met?  They're relevant because of this.  Each game has its purpose, and although Kojima wasn't thinking about all this at the time, they all set the stage for the finale of Metal Gear Solid 4.</p><p>This is really only part of the game though. But it's the most important part to me.  The complexity of the characters and the continuous tie-ins that bleed nostalgia kept me playing for those 14 hours until the final breathe of the game.</p><p>I am completely satisfied with my $500 purchase, but that doesn't mean Metal Gear is for everyone.  With Metal Gear, I wanted a linear experience.  Most games try to strive away from linearity claiming it's a bad thing.  If you're trying the represent reality, you must branch your story into many different directions which can splinter your focus and ultimately provide a stale experience.</p><p>In Grand Theft Auto's case, the story fails because of how inconsistent the gameplay is from the story.  In the beginning, Niko is just another guy trying to make a living.  However, if you play the game the way some of my friends do and try to kill as many people as possible before the cops kill you, the story falls apart fast when you get back to it and everyone is shocked when you kill a single person.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid does a bit of hand holding and several staged events that trigger when you walk to a certain point in the area.  The game is also filled with hours of cutscenes.  Overall, my initial experience was half-gameplay / half-cutscene.  It's literally 5 3-5 hour movies in one package, with some individual cutscenes well over the hour mark..  but you can save halfway through them.  You can also skip them too, except for one or two.</p><p>The story is also very much rooted in Metal Gear Solid lore. New-comers to the Metal Gear Solid series will definitely find themselves lost in the later chapters of the game and nostalgia will just wash over them.  This game is not really targeted towards new-comers at all and I don't imagine that a new-comer will actually like it either.  The target market is really the gaming community at large.  People that know games..  That's why the gaming press awards it with perfect scores.</p><div class='title'><b>Reviews</b></div><p>I'd imagine this makes Metal Gear rather difficult for most people to review because what do you actual focus on?  The gameplay is neat.  The graphics are beautiful.  The story is neat.  The story is brilliant to gamers.  Honestly, reviews are opinions and my opinion is stated above.  That is what affected me most when playing the game and that is what matters to me.  Metal Gear Solid 4 is the best game of this generation, in my opinion, and I don't think they'll be another game to top it, but it is clearly not for a wide audience.</p><p>If you see a review of this game that is absolutely void of emotion and doesn't even mention characters, you'll know what kind of gamer the author is...  like this fantastic gem for The Isthmus, Madison's weekly newspaper:</p><p><em> This is the solo-mission game to beat this summer, and it should be regarded as a great work of art.  You equip yourself with submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, a tranquilizer gun and hanguns, and you top them off with scopes, suppressors, lazer sights and rifle grips.  You need all those guns, because the year is 2014, and you are an old hero soldier who must shoot through heavily populated battlefields in the Middle East, Africa and beyond in a very long action-adventure where villains and their expendable troops are rising up to conquer territory</em></p><p><em> There are serious issues to ponder in the plot, which depicts a world at constant war.  Characters explore literary themes of mortality, individualism, the rise of machines and interpersonal relationships</em></p><p><em> Guns of the Patriot is pretty close to a masterpiece and contains some of the most addictive gaming of 2008.  Then you go online to find the same level of artistic detail accompanying multiplayer battlefields.</em> -Doug Elfman</p><p>This is a very stoic depiction of the game that reads like the back of the box.  In this game I do this and this and this.  There are guns and some type of story.  Apparently it's a long game, so I'm getting my money's worth.  There's also a multiplayer mode, so that'll keep me going after I beat it.  This isn't a review; it's a commercial.  He goes into length to describe all the types of guns without saying that each one has a distinct feel when you fire it.  NOT ONCE does he mention it's a sneaking game NOR that you can choose to take sides in the war.</p><p>The two sentences of actual opinion states it as "a work of art" and a "masterpiece" without giving supporting facts to why it is a "work of art" and a "masterpiece".  He knows there's something to it, but he can't quite put his finger on it..  better to talk about guns and what you do in the game rather than break the barriers of gaming and discuss it AS a work of art.  You know they're there because you mention "serious issues to ponder".  Does the fact they are literary make them a "masterpiece"?</p><p>I dunno..  despite how annoying this "review" is, this is really perfect for the audience of the Isthmus.  I think everyone should definitely give Metal Gear a shot and see for themselves what others regard as a masterpiece.  If I were writing this, Should I say that this game is not for everyone?  Disclaimer: Very linear story, lots of cutscenes, and heavy references to previous 3 games.  If the local paper decided to free up a tiny little portion for a game most of their audience doesn't care about..  Would you tell the audience, "this game isn't for you"?</p><p>Well, I think I would have to include that bit, but I'd also include how it made me feel and why I thinking it's the greatest thing ever..  because describing all the guns for the bulk of the article makes it sound like every other game, which Metal Gear Solid 4 is not.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Playstation's Trophy System" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/playstations-trophy-system">Playstation's Trophy System</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On the surface, the trophy system sounded like a good alternative to the Achievement System the Xbox 360 has from launch.  I kinda figured it would work a lot like Steam achievements.</p><p>With Steam, every achievement is valued the same.  For each game you have a percentage complete and that's how you compare achievements with your pals.  There is a lack of quality though, as this is really only a comparison of how much you've played the game versus your friends.</p><p>With Xbox Live Achievements, every single achievement has a specific value.  Even though Microsoft regulates that each game cannot exceed 1000 points (except through DLC), it's up to the developer to distribute those points in the game.  They can choose how many achievements and the value of each one.  Percentage Complete does not matter.</p><p>In a way, that's kinda neat.  For example: Of the 1000 points, you could have 2 really difficult achievements worth 300 each, and 5 dirt-ass easy achievements for 80 each.  One gamer could've gotten the 2 tough achievements for a gamer score of 600, while another gamer could've gotten those easy ones for a total of 400.  In this case, you can clearly tell who the "better" gamer is because of the score.  The Percentage complete wouldn't reflect this at all..</p><p>Though, the "better" gamer could easily scoop up those other 5 achievements, the criteria for those achievements could be something unrealistic for the "better" gamer to achieve.  Like "Complete the game on Easy" or whatever..  The "better" gamer probably has better thing to do with their time..  Especially when playing another game gets just as many points as this one.</p><p>Xbox focuses on the quality of achievements you receive rather than quantity, but, in many ways, quantity is its own form of quality as playing many many many games will get you a rather high gamer score.</p><p>The Playstation's Trophy System takes an alternative route to both implemenations, but still borrows ideas from each..  In game, you have 3 different weighted trophies to obtain: Gold, Silver and Bronze.  Silver carries more weight than Bronze, and so forth..  There's also a Platinum trophy for each game which is awarded when you complete 100% of the achievements in a game.</p><p>Each game has a specific amount of trophies they can distribute, but they didn't really say how they are distributed..  Does that mean each game has 6 gold, 6 silver, and 6 bronze?  or does it work like the Xbox and you can have any amount of trophies you want as long as they add up to a specified amount?  :shrugs:...  Either way, all these trophies do add up.  Each one gives you a little bit of "experience" which will gain you "Gamer Levels", which is the global way of comparing yourself to others.</p><p>This whole system seems like a refinement of the achievement system that pulls together both quantity and quality.  I'm a big fan of those Platinum Trophies because the system actually rewards you for playing through the entire game and doing everything.  Although, there are games on Steam and Xbox that give you rewards in game for 100% completion, neither service does on a global level.</p><p>The big problem I see with the Playstation Trophies is support.  At launch of the 2.40 firmware update, only 9 games will support Trophies, all of which are first party.  The free game that came with the Metal Gear Solid 4 Playstation 3 Bundle is on that list (PAIN), but there's no announcement of Metal Gear Solid 4 Trophies, which is what I want.  Also no Trophies for Flow, Echochrome, or Everyday Shooter :/  Trophy Support can be patched into any game, though.. so hopefully these developers will work on that.</p><p>Anywho, this information comes from the Playstation blog where Eric Lempel gives a video demostration of the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/29/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-1-the-xmb/" title="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/29/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-1-the-xmb/">In-Game XMB</a> and the <a href="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/30/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-2-trophies/" title="http://blog.us.playstation.com/2008/06/30/firmware-v240-walkthrough-part-2-trophies/">Trophy System</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to It's heavy" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/its-heavy">It's heavy</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning I woke up around 4:30 in the morning.  It was the first time I had ever woken up to my alarm and not gone back to bed immediately.  It wasn't too difficult since I went to bed around 9:45 the night before.  I got out of my bed closet and went into the bathroom, dragging some clothes with.  I took a shower and washed the night away to make a clean break for the day ahead.</p><p>I left my new apartment around 5 o'clock, while it was still fairly dark out.  It's been a while since I've seen a sunrise, but with the cloud cover vast and dark, it would still be a while longer.  I got into the car that I'm borrowing and went to my local Wal*mart.</p><p>Wal*mart didn't open until 6, but since they were only getting 6 Metal Gear Solid 4 Playstation 3 Bundles, I figured that I would have to wait outside before anyone else arrived in order to procure one.  I had this planned out all week for today's release.</p><p>On my drive, I nervously thought to myself if another 6 people were already waiting at the door, perched to snatch the few precious copies.  I had the rest of the morning planned out if such an event occurred for the other 24 hour Wal*mart said that if their night crew hadn't put their copies out throughout the night, the morning crew, which started at 7, would surely do so.  I had my suspicions, though. If not, there was still Shopko at 8, Best Buy at 9, and Toys R Us at 10.<br/>I turned onto Gammon and as I neared the beltline, Wal*mart was in clear view from across the highway.  All the street lamps illuminated the area like a massive spotlight in the grim dark of morning.  It went out of view when I continued underneath the bridge.  The tree line hide the shopping center on the other side.</p><p>I turned the corner and then turned into parking lot which joined both Wal*mart and Sam's Club.  Several cars were grazing in the parking lot.  Most of them keeping to themselves, but there were a few grouped together near the entrance.  I couldn't make out any figures from my current distance, but as I neared, there were definitely a couple people outside.  The group finally came into focus and a mere 4 figures emerged.  Yes!  Call me Number 5.</p><p>I park my car, went outside and approached the line just as the clock hit 5:15.  In the line stood 2 couples, so I was actually Number 3.  We talked about Metal Gear, and other games to purchase.  As the minutes trickled by, another person joined us and the conversation.  Then another..  and eventually another.</p><p>Number 6 joined the line around 5:45, so I could've waited a little longer before getting to Wal*mart, but I'm fine with my position in line.  3 other groups of people were too late.</p><p>At 6 o'clock the doors opened and inside we went.  Unfortunately, the staff were confused as to why we were there, and even more confused when trying to ring us up at the register.  This whole free $100 gift card w/ purchase of Blu-ray player this week wasn't trained to the entire staff.  It took the 6 of us a couple minutes to go through the check-out lines, but by 6:30 I was out of Wal*mart with both Giftcard and PS3 in hand.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080612_mgs4/IMG_0996.webp" /></p><p>huzzah!</p><p>After you purchase a Playstation 3 and lift the box, I think everyone's puzzled expression is the same, "It's heavy".  The thing weighs 16 lbs according to my bathroom scale.  It's a heavy-duty piece of equipment.</p><p>Anywho, now it's about 7 o'clock and it's almost time to go to work..... LONGEST WORK DAY EVER!

One of my local Shopkos had a couple Special Editions left and after thinking about how well its being received, huge future add-ons rumored, and a large chunk of my friend's list playing it...  I thought it'd be a good idea to go with the flow.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" /></p><p>Though, upon picking it up this afternoon, I noticed that all other copies of GTA IV were sold out.  Sooo.. I guess it wasn't just a shot in the dark that Shopko had some special editions left.  They weren't purchased because it's ridiculously expensive.  The Special Edition is $30 more expensive than the already expensive price of next-gen games.</p><div class='title'><b>Special Edition Swag</b></div><p>Here's what $30 buys you:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" /></p><p>There's the lock-box with two keys, a Rockstar keychain, an artbook for GTAIV, an OST sampler, a Rockstar dufflebag, and the game.  The lock-box is pretty cool and it's somewhat sturdy, but if it were locked, I could easily rip the thing open.  It's not that sturdy, unfortunately.  The artbook doesn't provide a whole lot of insight.  The dufflebag is kinda cheap, but it's not bad.  It'll work great as a travel laundry bag or a gym bag.  Also, the keychain is pretty slick.</p><p>The special edition may be expensive but comes with a bunch of things.  If that CD isn't too bad, with the keychain and dufflebag, I'd say the $30 isn't that wasteful.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>I've only played about 3 or 4 hours so far, but I needed to take a break.  The controls make me feel like it's work to do anything in the game.  I don't want to drive anywhere because I feel like I'm driving through sand the entire time, which hinders everything I do in the game.  I can't chase people because they get away too fast and can't evade cops fast enough.  I feel like I'm dragging my feet the entire time.</p><p>That's the only thing problem I have with the game, thus far.  Unfortunately, it keeps me from having tons of fun, but I'm still having fun.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to WiiFit will not work on me" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wiifit-will-not-work-on-me">WiiFit will not work on me</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>.. and it especially won't with that attitude.</p><p>Today, Michael from Dubuque posted the following link in his livejournal: <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/wii-fit/" title="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/wii-fit/">The Great Experiment: Wii Fit</a>.  This is a weekly report by Eau Claire / No Brand Con legend Vinnk, in which every week he's been diligently using Wii Fit in an effort to lose weight and gain a better attitude towards exercise in general.</p><p>Looking at the results of this experiment, it worked amazing for him. ^_^.  <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2008/04/02/the-great-experiment-wii-fit-%e2%80%93-final-report-or-how-i-lost-10-pounds-in-7-weeks-by-playing-video-games/" title="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2008/04/02/the-great-experiment-wii-fit-%e2%80%93-final-report-or-how-i-lost-10-pounds-in-7-weeks-by-playing-video-games/">The Final Report</a> is proof of that.</p><p>Hey, that's great that WiiFit can guide people to a better, more fit life, but it's not going to work for me, nor many many other people that think it will.</p><div class='title'><b>8 years ago</b></div><p>In the year 2000, I was a chunky dude.  I'm not the fittest guy today, but back then I was far worse.  Then one of my friends introduced me to Dance Dance Revolution.  He had just gotten back from Japan and picked up DDR 3rd Mix new in stores.  I didn't buy the dance pads or anything gay like that..  I played on the controller and got to know the songs.  I liked it a lot.</p><p>DDR became one of my top favorite games and I continued to purchase the new ones as they came out.  Then college rolled around.</p><div class='title'><b>2002</b></div><p>I loved DDR, but I was a controller nut.  I never touched the pads because I felt too silly and stupid.  But like most major changes in my life, I met someone.  Darlene was both a geek and a dancer and started the first DDR Night at UW-Platteville, that I whole-heartily supported.  My feet had never touched the DDR pads, but using the controller was not an option for this night.  So I hopped on the pads for my first time and sucked horribly.</p><p>Everyone else really wondered how I sucked so bad when I had been playing the game for two years already.  The proof came at the end of the night when I picked up a controller and tapped away at it.</p><p>This was the beginning though...  She and I kept the DDR Nights coming and I played/practiced the game at least 2 hours a day.  I loved the music, the gameplay, and Darlene was the perfect partner to face off against and provided the perfect goal to reach towards.</p><p>As the months went on, the pounds shed off of me.  Foods and Drinks such as Pizza and Mt. Dew just didn't sit well in my stomach anymore.  It felt heavy and I couldn't consume such products anymore.  I switched to a lighter meal and juices and such.</p><p>In a matter of half a year, I was nearly 45 lbs lighter.  I was a rough 200 pounder when I first stepped on the pads, but by summer I had gotten so close to the 150 mark.  When I returned to my summer job, my co-workers thought I was sick or contracted some sort of illness..  only DANCE FEVER!!</p><div class='title'><b>The years went on</b></div><p>DDR Sunday Nights was one of the highlights of my week, along-side SPAMM and other college activities.  But attendance did falter a bit and DDR, as a series, really began to stale.  DDR kept continuing to climb in popularity but after DDR Extreme Japan was out there was a massive drought.  DDR Extreme USA sucked balls, and subsequent releases were no where near the callibur of Extreme Japan.</p><p>Darlene graduated in May 2004 and the Nights were difficult to get going with myself alone.  The Nights were revived along-side the ACM Thursday Night LAN parties, but that was the only time I played anymore.  And even some nights I didn't even play.. I just brought it with.</p><p>I was still eating right and walking everywhere and with my busy busy schedule, I had a huge amount of energy and DDR really helped me power through the last 2 years of college with gusto.  However, the only time I really got back into DDR was in Japan with DDR Supernova.</p><div class='title'><b>In retrospective...</b></div><p>Overall, DDR helped shaped my perspective of an active lifestyle.  I felt fit and had a ton of energy throughout my day.  I was eating better, too.  However, the pounds came back after I started working at Widen and had nothing to do with my time other than play games, watch movies and sit on my ass all day and work.  I don't really need a hell of a lot of energy because I'm not doing anything that needs it.  So, at the end of last year, I had pretty much returned to my pre-DDR weight.</p><p>Smashing my car actually helped a lot though, because now I'm forced to walk everywhere and somedays I walk rather far distances.  I usually make a bunch of phone calls while walking, so I'm never bored.  I'm down 15 to 20 on average and feel quite great.</p><p>Japan was a huge pyschology impact on "walking" for me because I know how much distance I'm capable of traveling.  Walking all the way from my office to the Capital of madison doesn't bother me at all..  That's like a drunken walk home from the bars in Sumiyoshi to me.  3 miles?  pfft..  I've done that nearly passing out before.</p><div class='title'><b>WiiFit</b></div><p>I think it's great that Vinnk has had a similar video game exercise experience, but there's no way it'll captivate me the way DDR did.  DDR's music was what interested me the most, not the weight-loss.  WiiFit is all weight-loss in a very stoic comparative fashion.</p><p>Brain Age was done in the EXACT same way.  I actually stuck with Brain Age 1 for longer than I bet most people did.  Almost a whole 2 months, actually.  I had an entry for every single day.. but it eventually died for me.  The same stupid mini-games every single day can wear very very fast.  The bite-sized 30 second tests are the real killer and that's all WiiFit is.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">WiiFit won't work on me because it's more "Brain Training" except you're using your body rather than the stylus.  It's a gimmick that'll last maybe a month or two, and then take up dust in the corner.  This is definitely a great way to start a life of being fit, but if you don't have those hooks to keep you being fit after you've gotten bored of WiiFit, it's basically worthless and you'll gain all the weight back.</span><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/17">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/15">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
