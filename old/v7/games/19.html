| October 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week saw the release of Beautiful Katamari..  a game series that I hold close to my heart, but not close enough that I would spend the $40 budget price tag of the next-generation to own it..  Not right now anyways..  I'd take advantage of that Toys R Us deal, but I can't find a third act to follow :/</p><p>Distraught and disappointed, I came home and decided to start playing some PSP games..  but I was looking for something a little more than just an hour of a puzzle rhythm game.  Out of my 20 PSP games, I'd say 14 are not very involved games.. so that narrowed the field down.</p><p>I had Valkyrie Profile, Metal Gear Solid, Generation of Chaos, Final Fantasy VII and one other story driven game that really caught my eye: Gurumin.  subtitle: a monsterous adventure.</p><div class='title'><b>Appeal</b></div><p>This was one of those games that looked like I would really like it just from looking at the cover.  It had a funny super-deformed character with several other colorful characters behind lighting up the canvas with intrigue.  I took a look at the back of the box, and it looked like some medievil adventure style game.  A very japanese non-mainstream title..</p><p>When gamestop marked Gurumin down to $20 back in May, I gladly picked it up.  Kinda sad when a game gets reduced in price 50% 3 months after release.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Gurumin is about a girl named Parin.  Parin had just moved to a quite mining town in the middle of no where populated only by adults.  Or so it seemed, after running around town she comes across a little child being harassed by a dog.  Parin leeps to her rescue and beats away the mean dog.</p><p>This child's named is Pico (i think) and she isn't actually a child..  She's a monster.  Her brother Puco quickly comes to the scene and tries to save Pico from you.  Both Puco and Pico are surprised that Parin can see them, as they are not visible to adults in the town.  Puco and Pico lead you to a hole in the town's wall where you are whisked away to the monster town.</p><p>The monster town is home to many playful and interesting monsters, but it's not too long until Puco is kidnapped by evil phantoms.  This is where the towns-monsters call on your for help.  In the center of the village is an ancient weapon that only a true hero could weild.  She/he who can pull it out of the ground, is its' rightful master.</p><p>Of course, it's no problem for you..  You pull out the weapon and huzzah!  The weapon is an ancient drill that has been known to slay the evil phantom menance in the past.</p><p>Anyways, You run out to save Puco, but it's all a diversion.  In your absense, the monster town is destroyed by the phantoms and evil mist covers the once beautiful monster land.</p><p>Even though, you've been playing for about 40 minutes, this is the point where the plot of the game really begins.  With the town in ruins, you travel back into the monster land and recover pieces of the shattered village and inspiration your monster friends to rebuild.</p><div class='title'><b>Looks</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of those playful kiddy adventure games that found a home on the Playstation back in the day.  Much like Megaman Legends, Tail Concerto and Brave Fencer Musashiden.  You play a cute little character, fighting monsters.. but all the enemies are very non-threatening and have brilliant colors and cute tones.  It's a Japanese kids game. ^_^</p><p>Also akin to those games, Gurumin is fully 3D with very simply textures and models..  It reminds me so much of a PS1 game because it looks just like a PS1 game, except the image quality on the PSP removes all those jagged edges and really smooths out everything.</p><p>I've been playing this on one of those new PSP Slim and Lites, and I've noticed a fair amount of ghosting with Parin's little red pigtail ribbons.  Whenever she moves quickly, her hair will jerk to the side and the ghosting is very apparent.  It doesn't really bother me though, and its only really noticable when she's on a dark background.</p><div class='title'><b>Role Playing Aspects</b></div><p>Anyways, Gurumin is an action RPG.  You have your weapons, your equipment and your HP.  You never really change weapons, but you can upgrade it.  Living in a mining town has its advantages..  just down the road you have your drill expert that can teach you new tricks with your drill...  He'll give 'em to you for free, but you'd much rather pay for them than owe favors.</p><p>Leveling is kinda funny in this game.  You have 3 power bars for your weapon and whenever you successful defeat an enemy, or break part of the environment, it'll start charging up your bar.  Once you power up a single bar, your weapon will gain a level and do more damage.  If you get hurt by an enemy, it'll decrease your power bar which can result in losing levels.</p><p>The only equipment I've found so far has been headgear.  Each piece of headgear has certain effects.  The store owner gives you goggles right off the bat, which help prevent water damage.  You can buy new pieces of equipment if you want, but you can also upgrade the equipment you own for increased effects.  These upgrades don't cost money, but do cost Junk.</p><p>Junk are broken pieces of weapons and armor you usually tear off of phantoms while you fight them.  Most phantom wear a funny hat, or carry a shield.  When you fight them, you'll eventually knock it off of them and you'll collect it.</p><p>So far, I haven't found a way to increase my max HP, but I'd guess they are items you can use to permanently increase your max health.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As an action RPG, you simple run around levels and beat the crap out of enemies.  The attacking system is really nice.  Sure, you can spam the attack button all you want, but you can buy new powerful moves to use against enemies too.  So far, I've purchase a spin attack and a ground smash attack.</p><p>There's actually a slight bit of strategy in using these attacks too.  When you're surounded by enemies, using the spin attack is actually more helpful than spamming the regular attack button, or jumping out of the way and attacking them one by one.  It's a useful attack.</p><p>You can also charge your attack, and coming drilling into battle rather than normal attacks.  Charging your drill is also very good for destroying chunks of the wall and pillars to find money and secret passage ways when in a dungeon.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallels</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of Drill Dozer, but they are completely different games.  Released on the Gameboy Advance, Drill Dozer preceeded Gurumin by 8 or 9 months and features similar concepts.</p><p>Parallel 1) You both play little girls using the power of a drill.  In Drill Dozer, Jill actually climbs into a drilling machine which kills enemies and destroys walls and pillars.  In Gurumin, Parin's drill is more of a spear.  The drill tip spear head is plunged into enemies.</p><p>Parallel 2) Both drills have a 3 part leveling system which is not permanent.  In Drill Dozer, you begin each stage at level 0.  Throughout the stage, you pick up gears which will allow you to charge your drill longer and present a greater attack.  In Gurumin, each successful kill increase your level all the way up to 3.  At each level, your drill is stronger, but you charge your attacks the same regardless of level.</p><p>I suppose Parallel 3) would be the charging of your shots are dependent on a 3 part leveling system where the higher the level the more powerful the charge shot.</p><p>But both games are of two different genres.  Gurumin is an action RPG, whereas Drill Dozer is a side-scroller.  I suppose both games are stage driven though and you unlock more stages as you continue into the game.  You can also visit previous stages you've beaten.</p><p>Drill Dozer is a fantastic game, by the way, and it'd definitely recommend it.  It's made by Game Freak after they finished Pokemon Emerald and before they began working on the next-generation of Pokemon games currenty out now.</p><div class='title'><b>Cute</b></div><p>Gurumin is a very lovable game.  You play a funny cute girl who is very rude to the elderly townspeople.  She also pokes fun at the cookie-cutter story too..  The game has some clever item descriptions too, like those Disgaea and Phantom Brave.</p><p>It's really been a joy to play so far, but a little on the easy side.  It's still the beginning though, so there's plenty of time to be challenging.</p><p>After 2 hours of the game, my verdict is quite positiive.  If you like offbeat action rpgs, I'd say definitely go for it.  Gamestop probably has it for slightly cheaper than $20 these days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Capcom's Gamer Day Announcements" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/capcoms-gamer-day-announcements">Capcom's Gamer Day Announcements</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, Capcom has their Gamer's Day out in London, England and with it several interesting announcements had occurred.  One of the biggest announcements was Street Fighter 4.. but that's not really what interested me so much.  Actually, the trailer for Streeet Fighter 4 looks pretty slick.. <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml">check it out.</a> They also officially announced Apollo Justice, which I'm estactic for, but there's some else that could be interesting.</p><p>Good 'ol <b>Lost Planet</b> we see its release on the Playstation 3.  This is fantastic news.  The Playstation 3 release will include all downloadable content seen on Xbox Live and the PC version of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Why is this fantastic news?</b></div><p>Well, to be honest Lost Planet is a piece of shit.  The gameplay is restrictive and gets in the way and the final boss is unbeatable even when you knock his life to 0..  <a href="/old/v7/lost-planet" title="/lost-planet">read all about it</a></p><p>Lost Planet coming to Playstation 3 is a gateway.  It means that Capcom is developing a Playstation 3 port of their Lost Planet engine, which was initially developed when making Dead Rising..  This engine was made with love from Keiji Inafune's team in the hopes of one day creating a next-gen Megaman adventure game to the tune of Megaman Legends 3.  That's why there's all those Megaman references in Dead Rising and Lost Planet.</p><p>Making a multi-platform version of their Lost Planet / Dead Rising engine should give them more leverage in pitching the idea of Megaman Legends 3 to the Capcom powers that be.  This also means there's a slight hope for a Playstation 3 Dead Rising port..  or at least Dead Rising 2 on both platforms... or whatever they have next on the engine hitting both platforms.</p><div class='title'><b>others</b></div><p>Capcom also announced a new Sci-fi IP titled Dark Void.. so I wonder if that's the next game for this engine.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sneak King Final Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sneak-king-final-thoughts">Sneak King Final Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On second hand though, Sneak King is so monotonous that it gets tiring really fast. I liked playing the first level in the saw mill because it was relatively easy, but the later levels have more challenge and the limitations of the gameplay get in your way of completing your missions</p><div class='title'><b>Short-comings</b></div><p>After playing the same level of Sneak King over and over, you'll begin to notice that all the people in the level aren't randomly generated. Everyone is on a specific track starting in a specific spot whenever you load a mission. Irregardless of where you are in the level, everyone else will begin in the same spot, and usually they'll be hungry at the exact same times.</p><p>Even though this is incredibly lazy programming, it makes the game predictable. You know exact where you have to be at a specific time, and if you screw it up, then do it again. You don't need to take into account random events as you would in real life. This really brings the feeling of the game into a game-like atmosphere and you can improve on your score because of this.</p><p>This is fine for the first level, where people are predictably hungry when they near hiding places, but the second level flips the paradigm upside down. Hardly anyone in this level travels near a hiding place, and when they do, they're either not hungry or start too close to the hiding place for you to hide without them seeing you.</p><p>They cover for this by making nearly all missions in the second level Stealth based, rather than Surprise based. But those few that are hiding are nearly impossible to get an A ranking on. I'm not even sure if it's possible to do so. :/</p><p>I just made it to the third level last night, and there's a night and day difference between that and the previous level. You have a much more open space like at the saw mill, but you have a ton of people that are rarely hungry. Getting around is tough.</p><div class='title'><b>Not enough variety</b></div><p>Like I mentioned in the previous post, nearly all missions are the exact same. You've got a certain number of BK items to give out to people, and you either do it as fast as possible, or with the highest score possible. Sometimes they'll give you restrictions like only give to females, or don't perform a flourish.. Annoying things that prevent you from enjoying the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnt out</b></div><p>After playing this game nearly all Sunday, and then another hour on Monday, I don't think i'll be able to play this game again. 7 hours is all the enjoyment I've gotten out of it, and the only thing that really keeps me going is unlocking more achievements. I'm pretty close to unlocking a few more. I've completed around 37 out of 80 missions in the game. I don't think anyone has played this game that far. Gage said he played it for about 10 minutes and got bored.</p><div class='title'><b>Rate this game</b></div><p>So how do you really rate this game? It's horrible programmed.. you can't invert neither axis, and the camera angles screw you on occasions.. but.. it's only $4. You get what you pay for. $4 is cheaper than nearly all Xbox Live games... and it really shows.</p><p>It's because of that $4 price tag that I definitely recommend the game, but you probably won't get much play out of it. You'll find the same things hilarious like I did, but then get absolutely bored with nothing else to do in the game.</p><p>(and) This is supposed to be the better of the 3 Burger King games.. I wonder if the other ones are actually that bad. It difficult to screw up a racing game, but bumper cars? That sounds pretty boring..</p><div class='title'><b>Why does this work?</b></div><p>Something else that kinda puzzles me is "Why does this game work?". Why is the King such a successful mascot that they can make a crappy cheap game on the 360 and have it rise to one of the best selling 360 games of last Christmas season? Let's face facts.. you're only playing this game because of The King.</p><p>Burger King will never reach sales equal to McDonalds, but their marketing plans are great. 2006 was one of their busiest years for marketing. They had 4 marketing campaigns going on at the same too, which was somewhat confusing. They Cock Rock pushing those Chicken Fries, The King doing his normal thing, those Office workers pushing the dollar menu, and that one MAN commercial pushing the steak sandwich... They were pulling out all the stops.</p><p>These days, I haven't really seen any burger king commercials. I occasionally see a crappy McDonalds commercial, and those disgusting Hardees commercials have also made waves on my TV.. I wonder what BK is up to.. Perhaps they're biding their time until the Superbowl again.</p><p>Anyways, The King hits the mark at the perfect amount of goofy and bizarre that drives sales in the 18 to 35 demographic, i guess. Superimposing him into football plays only drives the point home further.</p><div class='title'><b>Hope</b></div><p>Hopefully Burger King will do some more Xbox related games or downloads in the future. I think if they went back and refined Sneak King, it could be a great game... but 80 missions of exactly the same thing is overkill.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 - Sneak King " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-sneak-king">Xbox 360 - Sneak King </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today was one of those rare days where I didn't really have anything to occupy my time.  Usually my Sundays are spent coming back to Madison from wherever I stayed the night before, but today I got back home around 1pm and had the whole day in front of me.  I finally finished up Halo 3, but that only took an hour or two.</p><p>I didn't want to start an involved game since Castlevania comes out in a week..  I was thinking about playing some more Oblivion, but it felt like a waste of time..  But then on the shelf behind me, I saw my vice.  A brilliant gem on the 360 that I was so excited for last year.  I had missed my chance to play it because I was living over seas, but my little brother picked me up a copy..</p><p>Sneak King..  One of three Burger King games released for the Xbox and Xbox 360 last christmas season.  In fact, It was one of the top sellers for the Xbox 360, since it was yours for the low low price of $3.99 with purchase of value meal.  How could you honestly beat that?  That's cheaper than buying a magazine about the 360.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day with my pal, the King and it was great!</p><div class='title'><b>The premise</b></div><p>Sneak King is probably the most market driven of the 3 Xbox Burger King games.  In Sneak King, you play as the king, and must deliver delicious Burger King food items to the hunger people of various environments.  You are judged on 5 things that will multiply your score:  Sneak/Surpise, Hunger, Flourish, Range, Chain.</p><p><em>Sneak/Surpise</em><br/>This is the initial point total of your presentation.  You can simply sneak behind the citizen, but you'll find yourself 5 times the amount of points if you surprise them!  To surprise them, you hide in part of the environment and when they walk by..  you jump out in front of them with a tasty BK treat!</p><p><em>Hunger</em><br/>Of course, you can't give anyone food..  they have to want it.  The king has special mind reading powers that allows him to see how hungry someone is.  When they are at their hungriest.. that is the best time to strike!</p><p><em>Flourish</em><br/>Giving food to someone unsuspecting is great, but you really need to let them have it.  When you pounce on someone you're given a guage much like in a golf game.  Get that thing to full and you'll present the food to them in such a way, they'll be absolutely dazzled.</p><p><em>Range</em><br/>The closer you are to your target, the bigger the surpise!</p><p><em>Chain</em><br/>This is really how you build up your points..  Whenever the King is spotted it throws off his game and he must start again.  The chain is how many chained sneaks you can perform without getting caught.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>Using the gameplay described above, you are presented with several missions in each area.  Missions are generally all the same except with different time restraints, score restraints, and sneak restraints.  All in all, you have 4 different environments with 20 missions included in each.  That's a lot of missions.  It probably took me about 4 or 5 hours to full complete the first area before heading onto the next.</p><p>That first area was sort of split up into 3 sections though, so it wasn't too monotenous, but you're still doing the same thing over and over again.  The different environments provide a change of pace, though.</p><p>The first environment is the saw mill.  You have hungry lumberjacks and workers looking for a quite BK break in the middle of their daunting day.  The second environment is the cul de sack.  The dead end of a suburban street where neighbors are walking around greeting each other and looking for a quite BK break of their daily lives.</p><p>The first environment provided you will ample room and plenty of places to hide and pounce on the hungry inhabitants..  The second environment is much more dense..  They focus on sneaking, rather than surprising.  Even though, you should always hide yourself from the public, they really emphasis that in the second chapter.</p><div class='title'><b>Progress</b></div><p>I just reached halfway through the second world, so I've still got a ways to go if I wish to achievement whore the game.  Sneak King is hilarious and full of flaws..  Quite possibly one of the best B-games on the 360 to date, next to Earth Defense Force..  Definitely check it out if you can find a copy.  It's a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3">Halo 3</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 14, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, i finally finished up with Halo 3.  I beat it on Heroic (the true difficulty setting), and proceeded to get my ass kicked in Legendary.  I found all the skulls and accessed all the terminals, so aside from a few other achievements online, I think I'm probably at my limit for the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>In order to truly appreciate Halo 3, you should really play through Heroic.  Normal is just way too easy to be taken seriously.  In Heroic, you get a true sense of the enemies actually being strategic when defending or attacking.  The brutes will always send in a little grunt to smoke you out.  They'll chuck grenades down the hall at you and try to cut off escape routes.</p><p>In Normal, you can easily mow down any enemies that stand in your way..  It's really no challenge.  Lately it seems like Normal difficult is the new Easy difficult.  When a casual gamer picks up a game, he doesn't want to play on easy just because he sucks..  He wants Normal just like the big boys.  Developers have been continually dumbing down difficulty levels to the point where the true experience is Hard mode.  The same was with Metroid Prime 3.  Games are getting too easy.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. Legendary difficulty is simply balls out difficult.  I gave up after consistently dying during the first few skirmishes in the jungle.  Penny Arcade was SPOT ON when they said Legendary on Halo 3 is a chore.  There were a few spots in Heroic that were challenging and took me a while, but they weren't difficult.  Heroic was that bowl of porrage that was just the right temperature.  Normal is too cold, and Legendary is too hot.</p><div class='title'><b>Environments</b></div><p>Isn't it rather strange that all the "alien" worlds look exactly like Earth?  True, when you're on a halo you can see the ring continue up into the atmosphere and when you're on the ark, you can see the rims in the distance..  But the actual environments you walk on...  there's nothing alien about them at all.  Why does the ark look exactly like someplace on earth?  Why can't their be bizzare plant-life?  Why don't we ever see indigenous animal life too?</p><p>Metroid Prime 3 has some imaginative places to explore..  Why does something as sacrade as the Ark and a Halo ring look normal?  Maybe that's something I'm missing in the story..</p><p>Also, there really wasn't any epic battle fought on earth the way it was fought in Halo 2.  The second level of Halo 2 had you fighting your way to one of earth's major cities.  In the distance, you could actually see the city and the havoc taking place.  As you fought your way toward it, it would grow on the horizon until you eventually arrived inside that city you had seen from the beginning of the battle.  Then you waged war on the streets and in alleyways.</p><p>In Halo 3, there's nothing like that at all.  The locations you fight on Earth, look like burnt out Army bases and bunkers.  You never fight in a true residential area..  and because of that you never get that emotion attachment to your surrounding to actually feel like Earth is actually in peril.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. The environments are varied throughout the game, so it's not the same level over and over again.  There's the jungle, an underground bunker, a desert base, base of a mountain, snowy hills, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Honestly, I don't think the story of Halo 3 is all that bad.  It's like a fun action movie where you play the unbeatable action hero.  Unfortunately, they really didn't do much with the backstory of the first two games.  I guess Bungie was assuming that if you're playing Halo 3, then you probably played through Halo 1 and 2 and remember the story verbatum.</p><p>Well, even though I have played through Halo 1 and 2, that was so long ago, I hardly even remember it.  I remember a little bit of Halo 2's cop out ending, but I really have no idea what the convenant actually is, nor the real importance of the Halo rings, nor most other stuff.</p><p>Apparently, the extra disc in the limited edition has all the cutscenes from Halo 1 and 2 remastered and cut together for people to catch up on the story..  So, I should really check that out.  I would REALLY like it if Bungie (or whomever these days) would remake the campaign missions Halo 1 and 2 using the Halo 3 engine.  I would love to go through them again and not have to put up with dated graphics and no achievements.  I suppose if Microsoft did that, each set of campaign missions would be $30 :/</p><p>Anyways, I thought the ending for the Halo series worked pretty well.  It put a lid on Halo..  hopefully when the do make a Halo 4, it'll be called something more appropriate.</p><div class='title'><b>More?</b></div><p>What more is there to say about Halo really?  I'm horribly at multiplayer and I really was playing it more for the story.  Though now that 2 of my close friends picked up 360s with Halo 3, I might be online a little more messing around with forge or multiplayer..  but I think I've hit my limit for regular multiplayer.  I really don't get that much enjoyment out of running around killing a bunch of people I don't really know to ascend the ranks and fight people that I can't really compete against.  Plus, there's other games to play ^_^</p><p>Halo 3 is a great social game, though.. so if you got a couple friends with a copy, getting yourself a copy isn't such a bad idea.  There's more than just Slayer matches.</p><p>I guess that's really all I have to say about Halo 3.  :shrugs</p><p><em>Related Posts</em><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-biting-the-bullet" title="/halo-3-biting-the-bullet">Halo 3: Biting the bullet</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-midnight-release" title="/halo-3-midnight-release">Halo 3 Midnight Release</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-initial-impressions" title="/halo-3-initial-impressions">Halo 3 Initial Impressions</a><br/><a href="/old/v7/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset" title="/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset">Halo 3 Wireless Headset</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PSP: Parappa v.

| September 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At the end of time and space, the Playstation is certainly known for the creation and flourishment of Rhythm games. All of Konami's Bemania games starting up with the Playstation hardware in mind, and other niche little title began to sprout up. Games like Parappa, Vib Ribbon, Gitaroo Man, Guitar Hero, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and so forth. Even Sega's UGA branch found an excellent home for Rez and Space Channel 5.</p><p>This is probably my favorite genre in gaming because the idea of using music to fuse all parts of your experience together paints a glorious feeling. Its the only way to push your emotions to the absolute limits and tune everything else out. Honestly, I feel that music is the ultimate expression of yourself and being able to convey that message is pure nirvana.</p><p>Being able to experience other's feelings and thoughts is truly amazing. Other games like Fzero GX and Wipeout also convey this message through their amazing soundtrack.</p><p>But anyways, I spent a good chunk of my morning with my PSP which has really been the center of rhythm based games lately. As the title suggests, I played some Parappa and Gitaroo Man.</p><div class='title'><b>Parappa the Rappa</b></div><p>Parappa is one of the key soundtracks to the Playstation One's life. A month after its release, everyone was singing the songs together outside of the game. Even to this day, it's an amazing feeling to be in an elevator with one of the songs in your head and you accidentally mudder part of the song to yourself and then another elevator inhabitant sings it along with you ^_^</p><p>Back in reality, though.. Parappa the Rappa is about Parappa. A little dog kid who's trying to get the girl, but just needs confidence. Through 8 stages, you help Parappa rap to the confidence he needs to stand up to bullies, drive a car, bake a cake, make money, and so forth. Parappa's catch-line is "I gotta Believe". It's very cute and teaches kids to be confident in themselves and your dreams will come true ^_^</p><p>The game is pure excellence except for one very large unavoidable train wreck in basic gameplay that will stop this game in it's tracks.</p><div class='title'><b>The Timing</b></div><p>The quintessential element to every Rhythm game is so absolutely broken in Parappa, I don't think I'll be able to play the game again. Each level you have a partner you rap with and you simply copy their moves directly. There's a little time bar going across the top showing the buttons you need to press to go along with the song.</p><p>Except when you do exactly identical to the other person, you lose. You try to keep time with the time-line, you lose. I have no idea when I'm supposed to hit the button. It doesn't make any sense at all. And then when I go through a line and think that I completely biffed it, it works just fine! It sounds like crap but the game accepts it! What the hell!</p><div class='title'><b>Game Design Flaw</b></div><p>There's one other piece of game design that absolutely screws you over every single time, as well. In order to defeat a level, you have certain grading levels throughout the song. Cool, Good, Bad, and Awful. When you screw up a line, it'll flash the level below you indicating that if you mess up again, you'll go down a level. This continues until you screw up twice in a row on Awful. In order to pass a song, you must complete it in the Good and Cool status.</p><p>SO.. that means, regardless how you've done the entire song, if you screw up the last two songs.. YOU LOSE and you must begin the entire song again. The entire song can be easy as shit, but if the last two lines of the step chart are unique or really tough, you're screwed for passing the song. It's not possible, just give up. You can believe in yourself all you want, but the game hates you.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict on Parappa</b></div><p>So screw Parappa.. I love the game a lot, and I don't remember the timing being so horribly broken. I mean, I beat the original back in the day.. somehow. I even remember getting Cool on the last level. When that occurs you simply freestyle by yourself with no grading and I had no idea how to do it.</p><p>Parappa had two sequels.. kinda. Um Jammer Lammy was a spiritual sequel with a guitar playing Lamb, and then the PS2 saw Parappa 2. I tried Um Jammer Lammy, but I absolutely hated it. Parappa was all about learning the songs you could sing to.. you can't do that with guitar :/</p><div class='title'><b>Gitaroo Man</b></div><p>Speaking of Guitars, Koei released this absolute gem on the Playstation 2 in between releases of Dynasty Warriors. It met with such bad sales over here, that it became instantly rare. When I finally learned of the game, copies were going for $80 on eBay. I thought all was lost, but Koei did us all a favor and re-released it. I snatched it up for $35 Used at Gamestop without a problem.</p><p>Gitaroo Man focuses on child U-1 and his life problems.. He loves this girl, but gets pushed around by bullies, does mediocre in school, and really has absolutely no talent. Little does he know, that he's actually the legendary Gitaroo Man and holds the power to rid the universe of the evil Gitaroos if he would only believe in himself and unlock his power.</p><p>The main premise is very similar to Parappa, except Gitaroo fights his opponents rather than learns from them.</p><p>When faced against opponents, U-1 grabs his Gitaroo and transforms into Gitaroo man.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Gitaroo plays very wickedly. It does have a time-line, but it winds around the screen and you're to connect to it by pushing in the same direction. Notes come down the pipeline, and you hit and hold the O button to play them. You're always using one button when playing the song, but the time-line winds around the screen so much, it is still very interesting.</p><p>But that's not all. You're in a battle, and your opponent will fire attacks at you the same way. To dodge these attacks, you use the rest of the face buttons as the notes center mid-screen. It gets a little annoying because of trying to judge the correct order of button presses, but it's more challenging than difficult.</p><p>The timing is spot on.. You hit the button when the note hits the center of the screen. What a concept! How the hell can Parappa gets this so absolutely wrong?!.. ugh, whatever.</p><div class='title'><b>Innovation</b></div><p>With these two modes of play, Koei really mixes up the rotation. The main mode of gameplay is Charge (to regain health), Attack (which will deplete your health if you miss notes), and Finish (which is all attack, but you lose health if you miss notes). The first 5 or 6 levels are exactly like this, but Koei throws a little curve ball at you. One level you are running away from a space shark, which involves dodging the entire match. Just make it to the end!</p><p>My favorite level in the game is one where U-1 doesn't even transform into Gitaroo man, he doesn't even play his Gitaroo. With his recent battles, he's actually gotten pretty good at acoustic and plays a serenading song to ease the soul ^_^. Later on in the game, this serenade becomes your theme song, and you rock as Gitaroo Man to win over the hearts and souls of an entire planet. It's quite moving ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict on Gitaroo Man</b></div><p>Koei sets up its gameplay, but doesn't rigidly stick to it either.. They play around with it and compose an excellent game. The sound fills you with compassion and you become U-1 and battle the evil Gitaroos for control of their Gitaroo.</p><p>I fully recommend this game, and if you own a PSP, you must own it. Definitely pick it up before it becomes rare again.. I picked up my copy a few weekends ago at Gamestop for $18.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Versions</b></div><p>Unfortunately, the PSP version of Gitaroo is exactly identical. They didn't add any remixes or new levels, which is an absolute downer.</p><p>Parappa actually defeats Gitaroo Man in the category. You can go on the PSN with Parappa and download new remixes of all the stages, but that's really it. They should have included Parappa 2 in this PSP game, and maybe even Um Jammer Lammy. It would've been excellent to have the Parappa trilogy all in one pack. Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>Length and Replay value</b></div><p>Unfortunately, both games suffer from extremely short game time. That comes with the territory though :/. Rhythm games, such as these, are short because each stage is the length of a song.. about 5 to 10 minutes. Each song takes time to craft and compose, so it stands that you'll have no more than a hand full of levels.</p><p>Parappa has 8 stages and Gitaroo man has 11. I just started Gitaroo Man this morning, and after an hour and a half, I'm at the final level. With those remixes, Parappa has an extended life time, but Gitaroo Man does not. Sure, you can go back and get perfect grades on levels, but it's nothing you hadn't seen before.</p><p>I think both games have multiplayer. Gitaroo Man has always had multiplayer, but I think they tacked it on for Parappa PSP. That might be kinda fun..</p><div class='title'><b>To recap</b></div><p>Gitaroo Man is an excellent addition in the Rhythm genre, and you'd be a fool to pass it up. Parappa on the other hand with get sales because of the nostalgia, but shitty gameplay completely ruins this game.. you'd be a fool to buy it, especially at full price.</p><p>Though, I find it ironic that I still hum Parappa songs before I'd ever hum a Gitaroo Man song. I guess replaying the damn level over and over and over again really puts that song into your head. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PSP Sales" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/psp-sales">PSP Sales</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I got mine <a href="/old/v7/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming" title="/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">a week and a half ago</a>, and yesterday Tony ordered <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org/?p=229" title="http://blog.t-kun.org/?p=229">one of his own</a>. ^_^.  But, it looks like we're not the only ones.</p><p>Last week, marked the first week the PSP has beaten the DS in a long time, if not ever.  But not only did the PSP beat the DS, it beat out all other consoles.  and NOT only did it just beat out of the other consoles, but it fricken creamed them by nearly 4 fold.</p><p>The PSP generated sales in the 277,000 with the PSP Slims debut week.  The week prior, the FFVII PSP sold around 75,000 of its 77,777 units.  I guess with the release of FFVII Crisis Core, sales are booming.  They've finally got their system seller.  <em>source: <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/only-in-japan/simple-2000-the-japanese-hardware-chart-304681.php" title="http://kotaku.com/gaming/only-in-japan/simple-2000-the-japanese-hardware-chart-304681.php">kotaku</a></em></p><div class='title'><b>Domestic Releases</b></div><p>Well that's good for Japan, but the PSP is looking very bright fot the month of October here in the states.</p><p>On October 9th, <b>Final Fantasy Tactics Lions War</b> is released which is a port/remake of the original Playstation One title.</p><p>On October 23rd, <b>Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles</b> is released which is also a port/remake of Rondo no Blood on the MSX.  This also contains a port of Symphony of the Night.</p><p>These two titles are huge and will definitely bring more people into the PSP area..  In fact, I'm sure these are the two biggest, if not only, reasons Tony finally got a PSP of his own ^_^.  These are, like, his two favorite games of all time.</p><p>Also in the month of October, <b>Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Plus</b> is released..  This is an expansion Disc for the original MGSPO, and I think it requires it too.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Life is good</b></div><p>With Final Fantasy Tactics, Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII, the PSP is starting to look VERY VERY nice, and has ample amounts of niche puzzle and rhythm titles too.</p><p>That said, I find it ironic that I haven't played my PSP for more than an hour at a time every since I got it.  Of course, I've only been playing those niche puzzle and rhythm games I own.  Once Halo 3 winds down, I plan on starting Metal Gear Solid, so that'll rack up PSP time.  Hopefully, I'll finish that up before Castlevania comes out. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Brain Age 2 + Rainbow Styli" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/brain-age-2-rainbow-styli">Brain Age 2 + Rainbow Styli</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After playing Online co-op with Justin on the first day of Halo, it was apparent that I needed a headset in order to communicate back and forth with him.  Typing up messages through AIM was simply too slow, and, unfortunately, I could not find Gage's headset anywhere.. even after tearing apart that closet.</p><p>So, I ran out to stores real quick and picked up the Halo 3 Limited Edition Wireless Headset.. Oohhh..  It comes with everything you see here:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" /><br/>Yeah, that's it.  Just the headset and the recharging cord, all for the high ticket price of $60.  This was also the same price as the non-Halo 3 headset.  I decided to go with the Halo 3 one because its subtle Halo 3 design wasn't blatant or as ugly as those Halo 3 controllers.</p><div class='title'><b>Way too expensive</b></div><p>Obviously, the big problem with this thing is the price.  The regular wired headset is only $20, and just recently Microsoft released an official Messenger kit, which comes with a mini-keyboard you can hook into your controller, and also comes with a wired headset.  That little pack costs $30.</p><p>I coulda shoulda woulda picked up one of those two products, except I went to Shopko, rather than Best Buy, Gamestop, and another store that probably would have had a bigger selection.  So my choices were a $60 normal set, or a $60 limited edition set.  I really just wanted to get back, rather than spend an hour shopping around, so I pushed aside my cheap ass nature, and bit the bullet.</p><p>It's probably difficult to manufacture, but this thing should really be $40.  Especially when you have the headset and messenger kits far cheaper.</p><div class='title'><b>How it works</b></div><p>This little thing is actually pretty slick.  Once fully charged, you sync up the headset to the 360 like you would with a wireless controller.  Once your 360 is on, hit the synchronize button, and then hit the synchronize button on the headset.  It'll connect to your 360 and link up with the first available player.  You can hit the sync button to cycle through which player the headset is for.</p><p>Unfortunately, that means I bought a $60 headset that is proprietary to the Xbox 360 and can't be used for any other devices.  It's not a blue-tooth headset, so that means, I can't use it on my phone, I can't use it on my computer, and I can't use it on a PS3 (whenever I get one).  That's definitely one advantage the PS3 has over the 360.  Use of non-proprietary products all around.</p><p>If I want a wireless headset for all these devices of mine, I'll need to drop another bit of cash for one.</p><p>Annoying.</p><p>I'm pretty sure you could use any regular wired headset with the 360 controller and  I don't think those are proprietary.</p><div class='title'><b>Crystal Clear</b></div><p>Despite it's cost, It works incredibly well, for the few hours I was using it yesterday.  It didn't pinch my ear and  I could easily and clearly hear Justin on the other end, and he said his end was just the same.  I don't know if I had the sensitivity too high, but he could hear other things going on in the background too.  Like the TV, which I did have kinda loud in the first place.</p><p>It'd be rather interesting to test that out..</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Overall, I'm not too pissed off how useless it outside of Xbox Live..  It works great.  Hopefully they'll be more games I actually want to play on the 360 over Xbox Live for me to take advantage of it..  Otherwise, that $60 really will go to waste.</p><p>Perhaps after my gaming schedule clears up, I'll pick up Tenchu Z and play Co-op with Justin online in that.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend this thing at all, unless you play A LOT of Xbox Live.  Even then, I think you'd be FAR better off picking up that Messenger Kit for $30 which comes with the mini-keyboard and wired headset.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Halo 3 Initial Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/halo-3-initial-impressions">Halo 3 Initial Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 25, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After a brisk day at work on a dreary rainy day, I finally put my Halo 3 disc into the 360 and joined the One Million users online for its first day.  My main goal was to meet up with Justin and play through some Campaign levels.</p><p>So far, my experience with Halo 3 has been nearly identical to my experience with Halo 2..  Exactly the same gameplay as the previous titles, with very subtle graphic improvements.  It's really funny how identical the graphics are.  I mean, the textures are far more detailed, but the models looks the same, the animations look the same.</p><p>Of course, I'm several months late into this news.  Everyone else already experienced and bitched about it when the Beta began.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Halo 3 takes up right after the end of the Halo 2.  Master Chief finally lands after destroying another Halo, and Cortana is still missing in the hands of the enemy.  Another prophet is hell bent on exterminating humanity, and descends on earth.  You begin your assault against this prophet to protect humanity...</p><p>Something like that anyways...  Despite playing through Halo 1 and 2, I really never paid attention to the story.  The actual story portreyed in those games seemed like running from battle to battle.  The action is what really drove the game, and all the back story and plot fell behind for me.</p><p>That.. and I never cared for Halo at all, so I didn't care to pay attention.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Co-op</b></div><p>Well, today is a brand-new day, and once Justin and I got into the same lobby online, we were off into the single player.  Unfortunately, Co-op campaign was just a little bit laggy for me to really get into it.  It wasn't terribly laggy, but just enough for me to notice.  Running side-by-side with Justin was quite entertaining.</p><p>We only played a little bit, since staying up all night to buy the game really didn't give us time to sleep.  After he took off, I played a bit of Solo.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo Player</b></div><p>Solo I found more legible to play.  I actually knew what was going on, and could find my way around without too much trouble.  I could also stop and look at the environment without getting left behind by Justin.. heh.</p><p>Halo 3's beginning is very parallel to the beginning of Halo 2, but without the whole cheesy special effects space battle at the beginning which was quite entertaining.  I love being back on earth, but I haven't gotten to any cities or urban areas yet..</p><p>One thing I did love about Halo 2 was seeing the metropolis off in the distance, gradually traveling closer, and eventually fighting the covenant inside the city..  fighting in buildings, driving warhogs through the streets..  You actually got to battle the aliens on our home turf and showed them we meant business.</p><p>In Halo 3, I'm still on earth, and they're still plenty of aliens to ward away, so hopefully we'll get into urban environments..  then again, it probably doesn't want to copy Gears of Wars too much.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>I didn't want to get too far in the campaign mode without Justin, so I went over to Multiplayer in full expectations of getting my ass kicked and I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get completely killed, though.  I was able to pull off a couple wins and gain a few ranks</p><p>Halo 3's leveling system is kinda neat.  You get so much Experience points for your placement in ranked matches, which will determine who you are matched up against to battle.  The matchmaker service does everything for you, and it took me NO time to get into a room and start fighting people.  MUCH MUCH better than Lost Planet, which took me 30 minutes to find a decent room on my own, and then be "matched" up against top-level people when I was just beginning.</p><p>Levels are kinda screwy at the moment since everyone is just starting out, but by next week or the week after, the top-players will really start to distance themselves for the mediocre players, and games should be quite balanced.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Statistical Tracking</b></div><p>Bungie keeps track off ALL Xbox Live ranked matches and will update all your stats online with much more detail than what the game will tell you.</p><p>Here are my awesome stats: <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock" title="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock">http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock</a></p><p>Whooo...  At the time of this writing, they aren't exactly up to the minute.  I think I'm a private now, after 6 or 7 matches.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Halo 3 is pretty fun so far..  I think its hilarious how Microsoft is marketing this as the biggest multimedia seller of all time, but, as Tony had pointed out, it's not as big as Harry Potter.</p><p>Also, I'm a mere 3 chapters into the story of the game, and there are supposedly a total of 9 chapters..  short, much?<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/20">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/18">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
