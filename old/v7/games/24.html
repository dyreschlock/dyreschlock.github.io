| October 2, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Since coming to Japan i've purchased a couple games; most of which, i cannot play because i didn't bring that equipment with me.  So far i've purchased..</p><p>XII Stag on Playstation 2 for $5<br/>DDR Extra Mix on Playstation for $18<br/>Rez on Dreamcast for $15<br/>Dragonforce on Saturn for $2<br/>Shining Wisdom on Saturn for $2 (I'm not really sure why anymore...)<br/>Some Kanji game on DS for $35 (oops..)<br/>Rakubiki Jiten on DS for $42<br/>Pokemon Diamond on DS for $42<br/>Chososhu Mecha MG on DS for $18 (after points)</p><p>and probably around $30 on DDR Supernova in the arcade, including the e-Amusement Card.  That kanji game was really the only screw up so far.  I might try to trade it in when i pick up Phoenix Wright II at the end of the month.  I've written a little bit of a review for the Rakubiki Jiten, so here are my thoughts on Pokemon Diamond and Chososhu Mecha MG.<br/>____</p><p>Pokemon Diamond.</p><p>Last Thursday, Pokemon Diamond was released to Japan and sold out sometime on Friday.  When we were walking around on Saturday, a copy of Pokemon Diamond or Pearl was no where in sight.  It's still as popular as it ever was. ^_^  Japan should gets it's second wave of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl this coming Friday, so little kids who missed their chance this past weekend will get another chance to pick it up.</p><p>The language barrier is rather amazing.  Since it's marketed for little kids, Pokemon is all in either hiragana or katakana.  There is no Kanji whatsoever, unless you count the yen kanji.  It's helps me build my reading ability of hiragana and katakana rather well ^_^, though i still don't have the vocabulary to know what's going on.</p><p>Pokemon Diamond plays just like any other Pokemon though, so finding out where to go and what to do is simply a matter of talking to everyone in the town and then venturing forth to places you haven't been yet.  I suppose later on in the game, this will become more of a problem.  Currently though, i've been able to get two badges and defeat Team Rocket twice without getting lost or frustrated because of the language..  It's not like Pokemon has much of a story anyways.  I can read about the new cool Pokemon online somewhere if i want the story.</p><p>Back to the yen, i always wondered what the currency actually was in the game.  When playing Pokemon Emerald, everything was in credits.  100 credits for a Poke-ball, 200 credits for a healing item.  I tried to figure out how much that would be in real-life currency.  Actually, i think about this quite often.  "How much would a Final Fantasy tent cost in real life.."  I mean, you make, like, thousands of dollars in the game.  It's not like the idea of going around killing monsters for a living hasn't crossed my mind before.  Anyways, it's 100 yen for a Pokeball.  That's $1.  What a fricken deal.  I'd buy tons of those, if there was a Poke-mart nearby.  Usually when you beat up some kid in the forest, you win $1 or $2 from him.  That's pretty mean.  It's like stealing milk money from children.  I liked my idea before where 1 poke-credit equalled 1/10 of $1.  Then a pokeball is $10 and a little bit more reasonable considering the amount of technology built in them.</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>The graphical style of Pokemon Diamond is quite impressive.  They have effectively transferred the 2D graphics into a 3D plane without screwing over any of the individual detail you'd find in previous titles.  The 3D plane is evident when you walk around and the foreground actually shifts along with your point of view.  It's a very subtle 3D effect that really looks amazing on the DS.</p><p>In battles the graphical style is alot like Pokemon Emerald, with a little bit more of a watercolor backdrop.  The pokemon still have little animations when they enter, ala Emerald.  This is where the touch screen is actually used.  All the battle commands are presented on the touch screen.  It's like Phoenix Wright, where you can either use the the directional pad and select options, or you can just touch the options to select them.  It's pretty slick.  I can still play pokemon one-handed!!  Whoo hoo...  guess who's driving while playing Pokemon when he returns to the states.</p><p>While walking around, you get a little pokemon gadget that keeps tracks on various data on your second screen.  It can keep track of your steps, the current time, your pokemon HP, and.. on other thing.  It's really helpful to have that info up front, especially the steps if you're trying to hatch eggs.</p><p>Speaking of time, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl use a real-time system, much like Animal Crossing.  When it's night outside, it's night in the game.  When it's day outside, it's day in the game.  My game is a little messed up since my DS is on US time, and i don't really want to change it.</p><p>One thing that i've also liked about Pokemon Diamond is the Pokemon themselves..  They aren't stupid looking, or ugly.  Most of them are ligitimitly cute.  I mean, when you began you have a choice between a leafy turtle, a cute little chilly penguin, or a cute little fire monkey. Awww..  I chose the Chilly Penguin ^_^. The first couple pokemon you face are actually pretty cute too.  There's a cute little bird and a beaver.  I picked up a cute little kitty mouse looking thing near the beginning of the game, which has turned out to be pretty slick too.  I've also been leveling up this Pikachu ripoff.</p><p>So anyways, i've played for about 9 1/2 hours and have beaten two gyms.  I found about 49 pokemon and captured about 29 of 'em.  Well on my way to the new pokemon total of around 500 or something.  I probably won't pick up Diamond or Pearl when they are released in the states, but i'll pick up the remake that combines the two.  Unless, i end up running out of things to play when it comes out.  :shrugs:</p><p>So yeah...  Pokemon Diamond is pretty damn slick, i must say.  It's a great pickup for the DS.<br/>_____</p><p>Chososhu Mecha MG</p><p>I found this game used over at Yamada on Saturday for rather cheap.  $32 is rather cheap for games in Japan.  Plus i had $13 something of store credit there, so i ended up getting it for $19.  Wheee..  that's rather cheap for US standards.</p><p>Mecha MG is basically a mecha game, but it has a rather unique control scheme.  You use the D-pad to move around your mech on the playing field, and then you utilize the touch screen to operate the mech..  Each mech has its own custom console, so you have plenty of different modes and attacks.</p><p>The first mission, you are given a regular 'ol mech that can pick up rocks and move them around.  In the middle of the mission, an enemy mech shows up and you must do away with it.  The console had two controls: a horizontal torso pivot and a vertical pivot.  However, there was a pretty big white-space on the side.  I accidently tapped the empty space, and it began to crack.  So i tapped it alot and it broke away to reveal a button to fire off missiles!  Oh yeah.. ^_^  I tore the hell out of that enemy mecha.</p><p>After the first level, you can move about the world.  It's a pretty linear map and you move about unlocking story points and uncovering missions.  Each mission has 4 difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Superhard, which have an obvious difference.  Defeating a mission will give you some money depending on the difficulty you defeat.  Money can be exchanged for goods and services.</p><p>Though, each level so far has given me a mech to use.  I don't actually own a mech to custom myself..  perhaps i'll get one soon.</p><p>Overall i haven't played it too much, but there is plenty game left.  Since i bought it used, there was some completed data on it at around 38 hours.  I played for about an hour to check it out before getting back to Pokemon.  So far, the game is quite slick is well worth a pickup.  If it doesn't reach the states, i suggest you import it if you can find it for cheap ^_^.<br/>_____</p><p>DDR SuperNova Arcade</p><p>So far during my stay i've spent a bit of cash playing DDR Supernova.  Konami has a card that you can purchase deemed the e-Amusement Card and all the recent Konami arcade games i've come across have used it.  It will save your scores, achievements, and other various data for the games you play.  I've only used it on DDR Supernova, but it can be used on Guitar Freaks V3, Drum Mania V3, Pop 'n Music Fever, this Martian Attack game, and so forth.  For DDR Supernova it will save your scores and rankings for applicable Non-stop mixes.</p><p>Supernova boasts nearly 300 songs that are new and old.  It has about 1/3 new songs for the arcade, and 2/3 revival songs from previous arcade mixes.  Of the 1/3 new songs, 1/3 of those are songs that are new to the arcade, but have been featured in console mixes before.  There's about 70 NEW songs featured in the arcade box.  I'm really interested to see how this compares to the US release of Supernova last week.  I'm really loving Xepher, the Seduction remix, AA, the new Des-Row songs, and the new Max 300 mix.  Otherwise i've been playing Quickening and Tsugaru Apple mix a bit, along with the occasional Paranoia Survivor.  Max 300, Maxx Unlimited, and Legend of Max are included, along with Paranoia Respect ^_^.  No Max Period though.</p><p>Overall, DDR Supernova is pretty slick, but it's missing a couple old songs that i would have liked to see.  I'm really sad that Rhythm & Police is not included, but oh well...  can't have everything.  The Non-stop mixes have been rather uninspired as well..</p><p>It's always fun to go into the arcade and dance up a storm to see the reaction of the japanese nerds playing their Dynasty Warriors game.  I've seen a few people who are pretty good at DDR, but overall, no one has really stepped up to kick my ass other than Kyle.<br/>_____</p><p>So yeah...  these 3 games, along with the Rakubiki Jiten have been my primary games at the moment.  I stopped playing Mario Kart after i defeated the Mirror cc class.  I'll probably get back into that later after i finish up Pokemon.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085"

Rez was originally designed for the Dreamcast with hardware and graphic capibilities in mind.  The PS2 port is a little bit muffled, since UGA didn't redesign it for the PS2 hardware, so Dreamcast Rez really is the best version.  Also, the dreamcast version was only offered online through Sega Direct, so you weren't able to buy it in stores..  I really was quite lucky to find it.  Now all i need is a Dreamcast VGA cable, and i will be able to experience rez in the best visual capacity.

Party Collection was the only good one i was still missing..  but...  it was $45.  I decided to skip it for now..

Not too shabby.</p><p>I continued walking around Togitsu to see what i could see.  I walked across the harbor area and came across the absolute CUTEST kitty i've seen in Japan thus far..  It was this tiny little black cat, with a cute little pink collar w/ a little bow..  I walked up near it and it meowed at me..  OH MY GOD!! It was the cutest meow you've ever heard in your entire life...  This meow could literally melt evil.  I sat down with the kitty and pet it for a while..  Lost in the cute-ness.  Eventually when i got up, it started following me a ways..  AWWWWWWWWWWwwwww...  Unfortunately, it was too dark for a picture..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" /></p><p>I continued down the river a little bit.  Togitsu is a rather clear town.  The wind is nice coming from the bay.  On my way back i noticed the Yamada electronic store.  Hey..  i have a point card at Yamada.  Plus i need Rice Cooker.  So let's check it out..</p><p>Inside i found these weird iPod speakers:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" /></p><p>Also, the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03653.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03653.webp">Initial D</a> live action movie, the PS2 version of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03654.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03654.webp">Evangelion</a> Pachinko machines i saw earlier, AND also <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03655.webp">XII Stag</a> for $5.

| September 15, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten.webp" /></p><p>So anyways, this is the Rakubiki Jiten.  It's actually been amazingly helpful while over here in Japan.  The rakubiki jiten is designed for high school students to study english.  When you load the game, the main screen is displayed right away.  There's no intro, or menu..  it's just loads the content.  It gets the meat of your purpose.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" /></p><p>On the touch screen, you enter in your kanji, english, hiragana, or katakana and spell out the words you wish to know the meaning for.  You can write out some english word, and it'll give you the word in japanese, and vice versa.  The recognition is EXTREMELY fuzzy though.  I find myself entering some kanji 5 or 7 times before it finally registers correctly.  Though..  in doing so, i memorize the kanji i'm trying to write because i have to redo it over and over again.</p><p>I've used it to figure out a couple things that i've come across while walking around.  Like this image from the other day: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01901.webp">here</a></p><p>This has the symbols è¥¿å?ç?º.  I can write this into the rakubiki jiten and know that è¥¿ is ã«ã?, which means west; å? is ã?ã?, which means steep slope; and ç?º is ã¾ã¡, which means town.  Actually i've learned ç?º before from class back in the day... so i guess i should've remembered instead of typing it in.</p><p>So the sign says West Slope City 19.  Five says that Japan has a quite different way of addressing residences.  Nagasaki, itself, is broken up into several different little towns or neighbors.  è¥¿å?ç?º is the neighbor i was in.  These neighborhoods are broken up further using numbers.  19 is way the hell up the side of the mountain.  Five lives down in 5, i think.  Beyond that, within the numbers, a specific building or lot has a number assigned to it, and addresses are further broken up if that lot has multiple addresses... such as an apartment building.</p><p>It's pretty easy to find an address you're looking for...  Within the City, just get to the neighbor, then the right division, then the right building, then the right apartment.  Though, it's rather difficult for me since i've been completely set up on the gridded road manor of addressing and finding places.  I can see how this works well for Japan since it's population density is incredibly high, but it would just be a bother for America to use this system.</p><p>Driving from road to road to road makes more sense since we're spread out and have plenty of space between residences.</p><p>Anyways, the Rakubiki Jiten is pretty slick.  Though, it's not like i've been walking around with my DS writing in symbols i want to know the meaning of.  I usually just take a picture if i'm curious and then check it out when i get back here.  It's a great purchase for $42..  So if you're coming over here to this great land and own a DS, you might want to set aside the money to pick one up.  Though, if you have a good dictionary, then you're probably already good to go.</p><p>Be careful though...  don't buy the rakuhiki jiten by accident.  That one is setup for students to learn just kanji and things, rather than english, so you won't find it useful at all.</p><p>___</p><p>Anyways, One other piece of technology i've been using has been some additions with Google Gadget.  For those who don't know, click on 'Personalized Homepage' when going to Google.com.  You can add any number of little gadgets to keep yourself informed of what's happening in the world.  I have it setup as my homepage with several news site, my gmail, the weather and a little gadget i made with a bunch of bookmarks of mine.</p><p>Well..  now that i was over here in Japan, i was trying to get the weather Gadget to display the forecast for Nagasaki.  It's pretty important to know whether or not it's going to rain since my main mode of transportation is walking.  Unfortunately, the closest city the weather gadget had was Fukuoka, and that was 2 hours away.</p><p>So i thought to myself.. "hey..  Google isn't just an english site.  I bet google.co.jp has some weather gadgets to help me out.."  Sure enough, i was right ^_^.  Google Japan has a ton of gadgets that are actually in japanese too, so i can practice the language as well.  All you have to do is grab the location of the google gadget, and then input in your english page using the URL option.  Pretty slick ^_^</p><p>I grabbed the Game Watch news feed and searched for a å¤©æ°? gadget for nagasaki.  I was surprised as hell that i remembered that kanji.</p><p>On a side note: Something rather interesting Don told me a while ago was that i'd be amazed with the amount of the language i would have forgotten since i hadn't done anything Japanese in between now and then.  Honestly, i'm far more surprised when i DO remember stuff like that.</p><p>Anyways, I found this wonderful gadget:</p><p>http://weather.livedoor.com/forcast/rss/42/118.xml</p><p>It's pretty poorly programmed, but it has all the information i need.  Once again, i surprised myself by remembering some Kanji.  Though, to be fair, é?¨ (Rain) is a pretty rememberable kanji.  I mean, the kanji looks like some rain coming down from clouds.  Others are é?² (Clouds) and æ?´ (Fair).  And then there are some conjunctions used in determining the actual forecast.</p><p>If you look at the feed you'll see a line of text that looks something like this:</p><p>[ 22æ?¥ï¼?é??ï¼?ã®å¤©æ°? ] é?·å´? - æ??ã?? - æ??é«?æ°?æ¸©27â?? - 9æ??22æ?¥(é??)</p><p>The first part is the day of the week (Friday's weather, in this case), then é?·å´? is Nagasaki.  The next part is the forecast, then the High temperature for the day.  Then the date, again, for some reason.</p><p>The High is pretty easy to read since it's just numbers.  20 Celcius is 68 Farhenheit, and 0 Celcius is 32 Farhenheit.  I pretty much just use the scale to figure out the farhenehit temperature from that.  Looks like it's going to be pretty damn hot at the end of the week.</p><p>The forecast will also add some kanji to make Cloudy w/ a chance of a Rain, etc.  ã®ã¡ is some chance of, and æ??ã?? is good chance of..  i think.  So é?²æ??ã??æ?´ means Clouds with a good chance of Fair weather...  or...  Partly Cloudly.  é?²ã®ã¡é?¨ means, Clouds w/ a chance of Rain.  Sometimes the reverse shows up too.  é?¨ã®ã¡é?²..  Rain w/ a chance of Clouds?..  That must mean, chance of Thunderstorms..  I mean, that's today's weather and it has been thunderstorming a little bit, so that's probably right.</p><p>Anyways, have fun with it ^_^.</p><p>__</p><p>By the way...  if you're seeing a box of little boxes in the middle of my sentences, then you don't have the japanese font installed in your computer.  It's pretty easy to install, you just need your Windows CD.  In firefox, to have it read japanese characters goto View -> Character Encoding -> Japanese.  Something like that anyways.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Import DS Games to look out for" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/import-ds-games-to-look-out-for">Import DS Games to look out for</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's very Earthbound/Mother -esq as this professor crash lands on earth and you are enlisted to helping him either get off the planet, or save the planet, or something. On the top screen, you have the interior of the professor's ship which has a very earthbound art style. The bottom screen, features a more realistic art style representing earth. Contact features a WiFi mode, to which i haven't really researched much.</p><p>Elite Beat Agents</p><p>Elite Beat Agents is the american sequel to Ouendan, one of the most popular japanese DS games in america. Elite Beat Agents / Ouendan is the creators of Gitaroo Man, and focuses on touching the screen when notes appear to go along with the song. The story consists of cheering people in need to better their lives ^_^</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 - October?</p><p>Oh Baby... The new Phoenix Wright game for the DS. It seems the sequels of Phoenix Wright focus on different points in the overall timeline. I think in the 3rd Gyakuten Saiban game, you play as Mia Fey. I'm not sure when this game takes place, but it looks like the past.<br/>http://www3.capcom.co.jp/ds_saiban/<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xenosaga III Fuck up" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xenosaga-iii-fuck-up">Xenosaga III Fuck up</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It featured one dungeon to be played, and a couple other things..</p><p>At the time when monolith created the demo, the game was probably 90% complete. All the story was set in the game, all dungeons, all everything except for some minor details here and there.</p><p>When they made this demo, monolith simply took a little bit of the actual game and made it playable so that people could experience a dungeon from the game.</p><p>It wasn't long before japanese haxxors messed around with the disc to grab source data, just to see what was on the disc, or to get raw data..</p><p>WHAT THEY FOUND WAS ASTOUNDING</p><p>apparently, to save time, Monolith decided to include the entire database full of story, quotes, etc rather than pick it apart to only include data relevant to the demo..</p><p>and once this information hit 2ch, the game was blown wide open.. All details for the conclusion of Xenosaga are now fully known to the public before the release of the game.

| April 15, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>about two weeks ago i got my DS lite and immediately started playing through the games i already own. i started off with Trauma Center and Castlevania with a little Tetris DS on the side. Trauma Center gets rather frustrating at times, so i began focusing on Castlevania quite a bit more. The other day i beat it, and today i finished going through it a second time. I'm somewhat burnt out on it now, so i decided to start playing Phoenix Wright and give Castlevania a rest.<br/>___</p><p>Phoenix Wright is a text-adventure based game where you have two settings. One setting is in the court room, and the other is outside of the court room.</p><p>When you're in the court room, the prosecution lays out their case and brings witnesses to the stand. Dialogue is spoken back and forth, usually comical ^_^. The gameplay of the court room is when you cross-examine the witness on the stand.</p><p>Each part of the witness testimony you can 'Press', as in, press the witness to clearly state what they mean by what they say, OR you can 'Present', as in, present evidence to teh court that shows a clear contradiction in the witness testimony. Usually the witness will restate their testimony so you'll have to find flaws in that. It keeps going until you clearly show they're lying. (so far, anyways)</p><p>The entire 1st chapter of Phoenix Wright is in the court; however, the second chapter features the other part of the gameplay.</p><p>Outside of court, the gameplay is exactly the same as Shadowgate, Deja Vu, and, of course, Snatcher ^_^. Look, Move, See, Do.. or in other words, Talk, Move, Examine, Present for Phoenix Wright. You move around locations you know of talking to people, searching for clues and gathering evidence for you case.<br/>___</p><p>The stylus is all you need when playing Phoenix Wright. Click, click, click. Although, instead the stylus, you can use the directional pad, buttons, and microphone. Holding down the Y button will activate the mic when appropriate. Instead of clicking on 'Present' during the court proceeding, you yell out OBJECTION or 'take that' to show the contradictions in the witnesses testimony.<br/>___</p><p>I think i read somewhere that Phoenix Wright has only 5 chapters. And after playing for about 3 1/2 hours, i've completed 2 of them. Chapter 1 only took about a 1/2 hour though. Chapter 2 was very involved.<br/>___</p><p>The gameplay is somewhat basic, but the story and the characters MAKE this game. The story moves rather quickly, and (even though it's sort of linear) you feel like you have control over the story. I think there were two parts that could have gone differently so far, but didn't affect the overall outcome.</p><p>It's pretty funny too. When any character is caught in a lie, or surprised, they have such grim animations for the facial expressions. It's very Anime-esq. Megaton told me that there were alot of Phoenix Wright doujinshi out there, and i can totally see why.<br/>___</p><p>Honestly ... this game is fantastic. widely entertaining, funny, intuitive. definately a must PLAY for any gamer.</p><p>I mentioned to Tony that Snatcher or Policenauts would make a perfect transition to the DS. Looks like Capcom beat them there with a completely new game instead ^_^. Honestly, i think Snatcher has been ported to death, but i'd love to see Policenauts make it stateside for once. A DS port might be the answer. even though Policenauts is almost 10 years old.. -_-;;</p><p>man.. the DS has some amazing games. Trauma Center, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, Phoenix Wright, Tetris DS.. and i haven't even touched Sonic Rush to its full extent. A++<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gamecube - Odama" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gamecube-odama">Gamecube - Odama</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 10, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>so today, i decided to check out K-marts video game selection since i heard there were some deals.. unfortunately i was misinformed, but they did have Odama which was supposed to come out on wednesday, so i figured i should grab it since i was there.<br/>____</p><p>Odama is a real-time strategy pinball game. The point of each level is to command your troops across the battlefield transporting the Ninten Bell from your end to the gate at the enemy's end. You command the troops using the gamecube microphone which is included ^_^. "press forward", "advance", "move left", "fall back" are all phrases spoken into the microphone to guide your army.</p><p>those commands are spoken while controlling the Odama, a gigantic ball rolling across the battlefield flattening both friend and foe. You have flippers on your side to knock it around the field.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" /></p><p>most objects in the field have to be taken out in order for your army to advance.<br/>____</p><p>So far i've only played it for a 1/2 hour before getting back to homework, and i really enjoy it ^_^. It is very challenging since you must be accurate with the Odama to knock over certain houses to gain items, or hit buildings that'll turn into bridges.</p><p>Doing two things at once is challenging enough, but to keep track of how much of your army is dying in battle and making sure your pinball does get lost adds complex natures to both your tasks.</p><p>"luckily, by the end of this game you'll be a god at pinball"</p><p>it might be easier to have one person control the troops, and the other control the odama, but probably not as fun.</p><p>definately worth a look ^_^. i'm debating whether or not to bring it to SPAMM tomorrow.</p><p>it's $50 at k-mart which is a bit pricey. This will probably be one of those games that'll have a short print and then disappear, so i don't regret the $50. Though, i'll probably do a little switch with best buy since they have a $5 coupon for this week.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Must Play Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/must-play-games">Must Play Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 16, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This semester has really flown by.. It seems that just the other day we were beginning school and there were a ton of games coming out on the horizon.. albeit my anticipating games thread from the end of summer: http://www.spamm.org/viewtopic.php?t=3265</p><p>Everyone of those games that came out and i actually invested time to play has completely satisfied me. Chaos Field is actually pretty involved now that i've figured out how to play it. I had great memories playing We Love Katamari. Shadow of the Collosus was amazing, even though it got too tedious. DDR extreme 2 had some great new songs, but you had to unlock them. and Gunstar Super Heroes was everybit as good as the original.</p><p>So what is on the horizon now... what are we all looking forward to in our gaming futures.. lemme see here:</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo Gamecube</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Yoot Saito's Odama</b></div><p>Odama was a pretty interesting and innovative concept when i first about it from E3 earlier this year. It's a real-time strategy pinball game, where you use your pinball to destroy the opposing army while you use the Gamecube Microphone to direct your troops to storm the opposing armies gates.</p><div class='title'><b>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</b></div><p>I've been waiting for this game a long long time and everything i hear about it makes me want it more and more. The game looks simply amazing.</p><p><b>Pikmin 2</b> for cheap</p><p>WHEN WHEN WHEN is this game going to go down in price.. so many retailers still have this game in stock but it refuses to go down in price. It's been out for a year and a half and is STILL $50. GO DOWN IN PRICE ALREADY!!</p><div class='title'><b>Revolution & Hideo Kojima</b></div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that he is in love with the revolution and has big big plans in store for console. He says, "..when comparing all of the next-generations consoles.. the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 are really just the same gaming experience. The Revolution is completely different from the other consoles which makes it very excitiing.." Sounds exciting to me.. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Sony Playstation 2</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence</b></div><p>This is probably my most-wanted Playstation 2 title at the moment. MGS3 completely blew me away with it's amazing story-telling style, well thought out and interesting characters, deep rich enviroments, and excellent gameplay. and recently with it's 39/40 famitsu rating, says that this update makes it near perfect. ebgames.com says it'll come out around mid-march for a cheap $30.</p><div class='title'><b>Rogue Galaxy</b></div><p>I really haven't been all that interested in RPGs at the moment. Maybe the reason is because i don't want to be tied down to a tv in order to play them. After playing the Final Fantasy XII demo, i was actually somewhat interesting in playing that game, but good 'ol Level 5 blows FFXII out of the water with Rogue Galaxy. The graphics look amazing, and the gameplay looks very more interactive and fun rather than the stoicism of FFXII. I hope my view on RPGs change in time for this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Okami</b></div><p>I've actually been waiting for this game quite a while as well. Okami features cell-shading in a much different direction than traditional games. It presents hand-drawn calligraphy mixed with animation much like Zelda and Viewtiful Joe. Gamespot says it results in a rich, stylized appearance that they've never seen before.. currently, it's projected to come out stateside by May 2006.</p><div class='title'><b>In the Groove 2</b></div><p>I've been so burnt out on Dance Dance Revolution. This past weekend i tried playing DDR Extreme Japan but i got so completely bored with it, i couldn't force myself to play it anymore.. my saving grace was In the Groove with it's challenging foot charts, but uninspiring music. But i've had a couple ITG songs in my head over the past couple of weeks, so i always like coming back to it over DDR. My wish is that ITG2 will have amazing music to revitalize dancing games for me, so here's hoping ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Microsoft Xbox 360</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Tetris the Grandmaster Ace</b></div><p>Tetris has always been one of my favorites puzzle games and the grandmaster series makes it very difficult to get your way. As you increase in levels, your speed is decreased to compensate for the amount of points you've gotten in the previous level. Tetris the grandmaster has mutliple modes of play as well, including Death Mode where blocks immediately hit the ground with no falling time. There's also an online multiplayer mode for Xbox Live.</p><p>I would buy this game immediately if it came out over here because there has not been a good version of Tetris on a console in a long long time, and Grandmaster is quite challenging.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo DS</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Children of Mana</b></div><p>I've always loved the graphical sytle of the Seiken Densetsu series. I love playing Sword of Mana and Legend of Mana, even though it seems others don't.</p><p><b>Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow</b> for less than $30</p><p>After hearing so much about this game, and playing through Aria of Sorrow for a second time, i really want to get into this game. But it's so expensive and i don't have a DS either.. sigh. I might need to suck it up and buying it for $35 before it's impossible to find.</p><p><b>Sonic Rush</b> for cheap ^_^</p><p>I've heard many good things about this newest 2D Sonic game. Some people say that finally, a true 2D Sonic sequel that brings back all the warm feelings of the Genesis. When i get a DS, this game will definately be in my library.</p><div class='title'><b><u>PSP</u></b></div><p><b>Every Extend Extra</b> (E3)</p><p>This is the spiritual sequel to Rez. Tetsuya Mizuguchi brings his expertise from Lumines and Rez togehter into one musical rhythmic psychadelic package once again. I cannot wait. This will get me to buy a PSP.</p><p><b>I My Me Katarmai</b> (or whatever it's called)</p><p>Katamari always spawns a great gaming experience and with their new portable version, the multiplayer aspect has been the main focus. Should be alot of fun ^_^.</p><p><b>Lumines</b> for cheap cheap cheap</p><p>I love this game, but it's $40 everywhere i go.. sadness.</p><p>________________________</p><p>well that's all i can think of off the top of my head.. I think there's a game on every platform that i'm looking forward to which makes gaming quite various<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/25">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/23">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
