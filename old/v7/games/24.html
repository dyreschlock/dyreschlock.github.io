The walk down the mountain was rather scenic:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03604.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03604.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03604.webp" /></p><p>I came across Natalie on the way down, so we walked down the hill together.

Off to my left i noticed a UFO catching machine that had something in it that was rather amazing:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03617.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03617.webp" /></p><p>An Asuka figure.. but it was a MERMAID!  Honestly, i'm not a real big fan of Asuka at all, but as mermaid...  I'll probably end up spending some money trying to get it.  it's $2 for one chance, $5 for three.</p><p>There wasn't a DDR machine, so Natalie and I didn't spend too much time in Sega World..  it was rather disappointing actually.</p><p>We made our way to our next destination: Hard Off.  It was much bigger than the Hard Off in downtown nagasaki.

They had a ton of Saturn games, but i was unable to find Radiant Silvergun, nor the Segata-san Shiro game.</p><p>As luck would have it, across the street was another used store that was massive.  It had the most anime i've seen in all of japan so far.

It was quite amazing.</p><p>They also had games.. Muahahaa.  I found the Saturn games immediately and begin looking.

Rez was originally designed for the Dreamcast with hardware and graphic capibilities in mind.  The PS2 port is a little bit muffled, since UGA didn't redesign it for the PS2 hardware, so Dreamcast Rez really is the best version.  Also, the dreamcast version was only offered online through Sega Direct, so you weren't able to buy it in stores..  I really was quite lucky to find it.  Now all i need is a Dreamcast VGA cable, and i will be able to experience rez in the best visual capacity.  Hopefully, i'll find some good headphones before i get back.</p><p>I also found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03634.webp">Lapucelle Tactics</a> with its beautiful japanese cover, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03637.webp">Mo-jib Ribbon</a>, and...

Party Collection was the only good one i was still missing..  but...  it was $45.  I decided to skip it for now..  If i don't find it for cheaper later, then i'll probably be back.</p><p>This place also had a top-loading <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03638.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03638.webp">Famicon</a>, a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03639.webp">Super Famicon</a>, a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03640.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03640.webp">Guitar Freaks controller</a>, and a cheaper <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03641.webp">Super Famicon</a>.</p><p>So... overall i picked up Saturn Dragon Force for $2, Saturn Shining Wisdom for $2 and Dreamcast Rez for $15.  Not too shabby.</p><p>I continued walking around Togitsu to see what i could see.  I walked across the harbor area and came across the absolute CUTEST kitty i've seen in Japan thus far..  It was this tiny little black cat, with a cute little pink collar w/ a little bow..  I walked up near it and it meowed at me..  OH MY GOD!! It was the cutest meow you've ever heard in your entire life...  This meow could literally melt evil.  I sat down with the kitty and pet it for a while..  Lost in the cute-ness.  Eventually when i got up, it started following me a ways..  AWWWWWWWWWWwwwww...  Unfortunately, it was too dark for a picture..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" /></p><p>I continued down the river a little bit.  Togitsu is a rather clear town.  The wind is nice coming from the bay.  On my way back i noticed the Yamada electronic store.  Hey..  i have a point card at Yamada.  Plus i need Rice Cooker.  So let's check it out..</p><p>Inside i found these weird iPod speakers:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" /></p><p>Also, the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03653.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03653.webp">Initial D</a> live action movie, the PS2 version of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03654.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03654.webp">Evangelion</a> Pachinko machines i saw earlier, AND also <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03655.webp">XII Stag</a> for $5.

When you load the game, the main screen is displayed right away.  There's no intro, or menu..  it's just loads the content.  It gets the meat of your purpose.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" /></p><p>On the touch screen, you enter in your kanji, english, hiragana, or katakana and spell out the words you wish to know the meaning for.  You can write out some english word, and it'll give you the word in japanese, and vice versa.  The recognition is EXTREMELY fuzzy though.  I find myself entering some kanji 5 or 7 times before it finally registers correctly.  Though..  in doing so, i memorize the kanji i'm trying to write because i have to redo it over and over again.</p><p>I've used it to figure out a couple things that i've come across while walking around.  Like this image from the other day: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01901.webp">here</a></p><p>This has the symbols è¥¿å?ç?º.  I can write this into the rakubiki jiten and know that è¥¿ is ã«ã?, which means west; å? is ã?ã?, which means steep slope; and ç?º is ã¾ã¡, which means town.  Actually i've learned ç?º before from class back in the day... so i guess i should've remembered instead of typing it in.</p><p>So the sign says West Slope City 19.  Five says that Japan has a quite different way of addressing residences.  Nagasaki, itself, is broken up into several different little towns or neighbors.  è¥¿å?ç?º is the neighbor i was in.  These neighborhoods are broken up further using numbers.  19 is way the hell up the side of the mountain.  Five lives down in 5, i think.  Beyond that, within the numbers, a specific building or lot has a number assigned to it, and addresses are further broken up if that lot has multiple addresses... such as an apartment building.</p><p>It's pretty easy to find an address you're looking for...  Within the City, just get to the neighbor, then the right division, then the right building, then the right apartment.  Though, it's rather difficult for me since i've been completely set up on the gridded road manor of addressing and finding places.  I can see how this works well for Japan since it's population density is incredibly high, but it would just be a bother for America to use this system.</p><p>Driving from road to road to road makes more sense since we're spread out and have plenty of space between residences.</p><p>Anyways, the Rakubiki Jiten is pretty slick.  Though, it's not like i've been walking around with my DS writing in symbols i want to know the meaning of.  I usually just take a picture if i'm curious and then check it out when i get back here.  It's a great purchase for $42..  So if you're coming over here to this great land and own a DS, you might want to set aside the money to pick one up.  Though, if you have a good dictionary, then you're probably already good to go.</p><p>Be careful though...  don't buy the rakuhiki jiten by accident.  That one is setup for students to learn just kanji and things, rather than english, so you won't find it useful at all.</p><p>___</p><p>Anyways, One other piece of technology i've been using has been some additions with Google Gadget.  For those who don't know, click on 'Personalized Homepage' when going to Google.com.  You can add any number of little gadgets to keep yourself informed of what's happening in the world.  I have it setup as my homepage with several news site, my gmail, the weather and a little gadget i made with a bunch of bookmarks of mine.</p><p>Well..  now that i was over here in Japan, i was trying to get the weather Gadget to display the forecast for Nagasaki.  It's pretty important to know whether or not it's going to rain since my main mode of transportation is walking.  Unfortunately, the closest city the weather gadget had was Fukuoka, and that was 2 hours away.</p><p>So i thought to myself.. "hey..  Google isn't just an english site.  I bet google.co.jp has some weather gadgets to help me out.."  Sure enough, i was right ^_^.  Google Japan has a ton of gadgets that are actually in japanese too, so i can practice the language as well.  All you have to do is grab the location of the google gadget, and then input in your english page using the URL option.  Pretty slick ^_^</p><p>I grabbed the Game Watch news feed and searched for a å¤©æ°? gadget for nagasaki.  I was surprised as hell that i remembered that kanji.</p><p>On a side note: Something rather interesting Don told me a while ago was that i'd be amazed with the amount of the language i would have forgotten since i hadn't done anything Japanese in between now and then.  Honestly, i'm far more surprised when i DO remember stuff like that.</p><p>Anyways, I found this wonderful gadget:</p><p>http://weather.livedoor.com/forcast/rss/42/118.xml</p><p>It's pretty poorly programmed, but it has all the information i need.  Once again, i surprised myself by remembering some Kanji.  Though, to be fair, é?¨ (Rain) is a pretty rememberable kanji.  I mean, the kanji looks like some rain coming down from clouds.  Others are é?² (Clouds) and æ?´ (Fair).  And then there are some conjunctions used in determining the actual forecast.</p><p>If you look at the feed you'll see a line of text that looks something like this:</p><p>[ 22æ?¥ï¼?é??ï¼?ã®å¤©æ°? ] é?·å´? - æ??ã?? - æ??é«?æ°?æ¸©27â?? - 9æ??22æ?¥(é??)</p><p>The first part is the day of the week (Friday's weather, in this case), then é?·å´? is Nagasaki.  The next part is the forecast, then the High temperature for the day.  Then the date, again, for some reason.</p><p>The High is pretty easy to read since it's just numbers.  20 Celcius is 68 Farhenheit, and 0 Celcius is 32 Farhenheit.  I pretty much just use the scale to figure out the farhenehit temperature from that.  Looks like it's going to be pretty damn hot at the end of the week.</p><p>The forecast will also add some kanji to make Cloudy w/ a chance of a Rain, etc.  ã®ã¡ is some chance of, and æ??ã?? is good chance of..  i think.  So é?²æ??ã??æ?´ means Clouds with a good chance of Fair weather...  or...  Partly Cloudly.  é?²ã®ã¡é?¨ means, Clouds w/ a chance of Rain.  Sometimes the reverse shows up too.  é?¨ã®ã¡é?²..  Rain w/ a chance of Clouds?..  That must mean, chance of Thunderstorms..  I mean, that's today's weather and it has been thunderstorming a little bit, so that's probably right.</p><p>Anyways, have fun with it ^_^.</p><p>__</p><p>By the way...  if you're seeing a box of little boxes in the middle of my sentences, then you don't have the japanese font installed in your computer.  It's pretty easy to install, you just need your Windows CD.  In firefox, to have it read japanese characters goto View -> Character Encoding -> Japanese.  Something like that anyways.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Import DS Games to look out for" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/import-ds-games-to-look-out-for">Import DS Games to look out for</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's very Earthbound/Mother -esq as this professor crash lands on earth and you are enlisted to helping him either get off the planet, or save the planet, or something. On the top screen, you have the interior of the professor's ship which has a very earthbound art style. The bottom screen, features a more realistic art style representing earth. Contact features a WiFi mode, to which i haven't really researched much.</p><p>Elite Beat Agents</p><p>Elite Beat Agents is the american sequel to Ouendan, one of the most popular japanese DS games in america. Elite Beat Agents / Ouendan is the creators of Gitaroo Man, and focuses on touching the screen when notes appear to go along with the song. The story consists of cheering people in need to better their lives ^_^</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 - October?</p><p>Oh Baby... The new Phoenix Wright game for the DS. It seems the sequels of Phoenix Wright focus on different points in the overall timeline. I think in the 3rd Gyakuten Saiban game, you play as Mia Fey. I'm not sure when this game takes place, but it looks like the past.<br/>http://www3.capcom.co.jp/ds_saiban/<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xenosaga III Fuck up" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xenosaga-iii-fuck-up">Xenosaga III Fuck up</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 15, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>about two weeks ago i got my DS lite and immediately started playing through the games i already own. i started off with Trauma Center and Castlevania with a little Tetris DS on the side. Trauma Center gets rather frustrating at times, so i began focusing on Castlevania quite a bit more. The other day i beat it, and today i finished going through it a second time. I'm somewhat burnt out on it now, so i decided to start playing Phoenix Wright and give Castlevania a rest.<br/>___</p><p>Phoenix Wright is a text-adventure based game where you have two settings. One setting is in the court room, and the other is outside of the court room.</p><p>When you're in the court room, the prosecution lays out their case and brings witnesses to the stand. Dialogue is spoken back and forth, usually comical ^_^. The gameplay of the court room is when you cross-examine the witness on the stand.</p><p>Each part of the witness testimony you can 'Press', as in, press the witness to clearly state what they mean by what they say, OR you can 'Present', as in, present evidence to teh court that shows a clear contradiction in the witness testimony. Usually the witness will restate their testimony so you'll have to find flaws in that. It keeps going until you clearly show they're lying. (so far, anyways)</p><p>The entire 1st chapter of Phoenix Wright is in the court; however, the second chapter features the other part of the gameplay.</p><p>Outside of court, the gameplay is exactly the same as Shadowgate, Deja Vu, and, of course, Snatcher ^_^. Look, Move, See, Do.. or in other words, Talk, Move, Examine, Present for Phoenix Wright. You move around locations you know of talking to people, searching for clues and gathering evidence for you case.<br/>___</p><p>The stylus is all you need when playing Phoenix Wright. Click, click, click. Although, instead the stylus, you can use the directional pad, buttons, and microphone. Holding down the Y button will activate the mic when appropriate. Instead of clicking on 'Present' during the court proceeding, you yell out OBJECTION or 'take that' to show the contradictions in the witnesses testimony.<br/>___</p><p>I think i read somewhere that Phoenix Wright has only 5 chapters. And after playing for about 3 1/2 hours, i've completed 2 of them. Chapter 1 only took about a 1/2 hour though. Chapter 2 was very involved.<br/>___</p><p>The gameplay is somewhat basic, but the story and the characters MAKE this game. The story moves rather quickly, and (even though it's sort of linear) you feel like you have control over the story. I think there were two parts that could have gone differently so far, but didn't affect the overall outcome.</p><p>It's pretty funny too. When any character is caught in a lie, or surprised, they have such grim animations for the facial expressions. It's very Anime-esq. Megaton told me that there were alot of Phoenix Wright doujinshi out there, and i can totally see why.<br/>___</p><p>Honestly ... this game is fantastic. widely entertaining, funny, intuitive. definately a must PLAY for any gamer.</p><p>I mentioned to Tony that Snatcher or Policenauts would make a perfect transition to the DS. Looks like Capcom beat them there with a completely new game instead ^_^. Honestly, i think Snatcher has been ported to death, but i'd love to see Policenauts make it stateside for once. A DS port might be the answer. even though Policenauts is almost 10 years old.. -_-;;</p><p>man.. the DS has some amazing games. Trauma Center, Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, Phoenix Wright, Tetris DS.. and i haven't even touched Sonic Rush to its full extent. A++<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gamecube - Odama" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gamecube-odama">Gamecube - Odama</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 10, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>so today, i decided to check out K-marts video game selection since i heard there were some deals.. unfortunately i was misinformed, but they did have Odama which was supposed to come out on wednesday, so i figured i should grab it since i was there.<br/>____</p><p>Odama is a real-time strategy pinball game. The point of each level is to command your troops across the battlefield transporting the Ninten Bell from your end to the gate at the enemy's end. You command the troops using the gamecube microphone which is included ^_^. "press forward", "advance", "move left", "fall back" are all phrases spoken into the microphone to guide your army.</p><p>those commands are spoken while controlling the Odama, a gigantic ball rolling across the battlefield flattening both friend and foe. You have flippers on your side to knock it around the field.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Odama.webp" /></p><p>most objects in the field have to be taken out in order for your army to advance.<br/>____</p><p>So far i've only played it for a 1/2 hour before getting back to homework, and i really enjoy it ^_^. It is very challenging since you must be accurate with the Odama to knock over certain houses to gain items, or hit buildings that'll turn into bridges.</p><p>Doing two things at once is challenging enough, but to keep track of how much of your army is dying in battle and making sure your pinball does get lost adds complex natures to both your tasks.</p><p>"luckily, by the end of this game you'll be a god at pinball"</p><p>it might be easier to have one person control the troops, and the other control the odama, but probably not as fun.</p><p>definately worth a look ^_^. i'm debating whether or not to bring it to SPAMM tomorrow.</p><p>it's $50 at k-mart which is a bit pricey. This will probably be one of those games that'll have a short print and then disappear, so i don't regret the $50. Though, i'll probably do a little switch with best buy since they have a $5 coupon for this week.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Must Play Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/must-play-games">Must Play Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 16, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This semester has really flown by.. It seems that just the other day we were beginning school and there were a ton of games coming out on the horizon.. albeit my anticipating games thread from the end of summer: http://www.spamm.org/viewtopic.php?t=3265</p><p>Everyone of those games that came out and i actually invested time to play has completely satisfied me. Chaos Field is actually pretty involved now that i've figured out how to play it. I had great memories playing We Love Katamari. Shadow of the Collosus was amazing, even though it got too tedious. DDR extreme 2 had some great new songs, but you had to unlock them. and Gunstar Super Heroes was everybit as good as the original.</p><p>So what is on the horizon now... what are we all looking forward to in our gaming futures.. lemme see here:</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo Gamecube</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Yoot Saito's Odama</b></div><p>Odama was a pretty interesting and innovative concept when i first about it from E3 earlier this year. It's a real-time strategy pinball game, where you use your pinball to destroy the opposing army while you use the Gamecube Microphone to direct your troops to storm the opposing armies gates.</p><div class='title'><b>The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</b></div><p>I've been waiting for this game a long long time and everything i hear about it makes me want it more and more. The game looks simply amazing.</p><p><b>Pikmin 2</b> for cheap</p><p>WHEN WHEN WHEN is this game going to go down in price.. so many retailers still have this game in stock but it refuses to go down in price. It's been out for a year and a half and is STILL $50. GO DOWN IN PRICE ALREADY!!</p><div class='title'><b>Revolution & Hideo Kojima</b></div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that he is in love with the revolution and has big big plans in store for console. He says, "..when comparing all of the next-generations consoles.. the PC, Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 are really just the same gaming experience. The Revolution is completely different from the other consoles which makes it very excitiing.." Sounds exciting to me.. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Sony Playstation 2</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Metal Gear Solid 3 Subsistence</b></div><p>This is probably my most-wanted Playstation 2 title at the moment. MGS3 completely blew me away with it's amazing story-telling style, well thought out and interesting characters, deep rich enviroments, and excellent gameplay. and recently with it's 39/40 famitsu rating, says that this update makes it near perfect. ebgames.com says it'll come out around mid-march for a cheap $30.</p><div class='title'><b>Rogue Galaxy</b></div><p>I really haven't been all that interested in RPGs at the moment. Maybe the reason is because i don't want to be tied down to a tv in order to play them. After playing the Final Fantasy XII demo, i was actually somewhat interesting in playing that game, but good 'ol Level 5 blows FFXII out of the water with Rogue Galaxy. The graphics look amazing, and the gameplay looks very more interactive and fun rather than the stoicism of FFXII. I hope my view on RPGs change in time for this game. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Okami</b></div><p>I've actually been waiting for this game quite a while as well. Okami features cell-shading in a much different direction than traditional games. It presents hand-drawn calligraphy mixed with animation much like Zelda and Viewtiful Joe. Gamespot says it results in a rich, stylized appearance that they've never seen before.. currently, it's projected to come out stateside by May 2006.</p><div class='title'><b>In the Groove 2</b></div><p>I've been so burnt out on Dance Dance Revolution. This past weekend i tried playing DDR Extreme Japan but i got so completely bored with it, i couldn't force myself to play it anymore.. my saving grace was In the Groove with it's challenging foot charts, but uninspiring music. But i've had a couple ITG songs in my head over the past couple of weeks, so i always like coming back to it over DDR. My wish is that ITG2 will have amazing music to revitalize dancing games for me, so here's hoping ^_^</p><div class='title'><b><u>Microsoft Xbox 360</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Tetris the Grandmaster Ace</b></div><p>Tetris has always been one of my favorites puzzle games and the grandmaster series makes it very difficult to get your way. As you increase in levels, your speed is decreased to compensate for the amount of points you've gotten in the previous level. Tetris the grandmaster has mutliple modes of play as well, including Death Mode where blocks immediately hit the ground with no falling time. There's also an online multiplayer mode for Xbox Live.</p><p>I would buy this game immediately if it came out over here because there has not been a good version of Tetris on a console in a long long time, and Grandmaster is quite challenging.</p><div class='title'><b><u>Nintendo DS</u></b></div><div class='title'><b>Children of Mana</b></div><p>I've always loved the graphical sytle of the Seiken Densetsu series. I love playing Sword of Mana and Legend of Mana, even though it seems others don't.</p><p><b>Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow</b> for less than $30</p><p>After hearing so much about this game, and playing through Aria of Sorrow for a second time, i really want to get into this game. But it's so expensive and i don't have a DS either.. sigh. I might need to suck it up and buying it for $35 before it's impossible to find.</p><p><b>Sonic Rush</b> for cheap ^_^</p><p>I've heard many good things about this newest 2D Sonic game. Some people say that finally, a true 2D Sonic sequel that brings back all the warm feelings of the Genesis. When i get a DS, this game will definately be in my library.</p><div class='title'><b><u>PSP</u></b></div><p><b>Every Extend Extra</b> (E3)</p><p>This is the spiritual sequel to Rez. Tetsuya Mizuguchi brings his expertise from Lumines and Rez togehter into one musical rhythmic psychadelic package once again. I cannot wait. This will get me to buy a PSP.</p><p><b>I My Me Katarmai</b> (or whatever it's called)</p><p>Katamari always spawns a great gaming experience and with their new portable version, the multiplayer aspect has been the main focus. Should be alot of fun ^_^.</p><p><b>Lumines</b> for cheap cheap cheap</p><p>I love this game, but it's $40 everywhere i go.. sadness.</p><p>________________________</p><p>well that's all i can think of off the top of my head.. I think there's a game on every platform that i'm looking forward to which makes gaming quite various<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-perfect-dark-zero-impressions">Xbox 360 / Perfect Dark Zero impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

First there was a controller, then a memory card, then Perfect Dark Zero, and then tuesday night, there was an Xbox 360.</p><p>I watched my roommate play PDZ a little bit, but i wasn't really all that impressed.. the graphics looked hokey, and the character movements were pretty primitive.</p><p>After my rough day of studying, testing and finishing up projects, and between playing Chaos Field i decided to check it out since it was just sitting there.<br/>________</p><p>The Xbox 360 is differently designed than all other systems i've played before.. including PC games. When you start up the Xbox 360 and it loads a game, the 360 requires a login. the 360, not the game. You can have multiple profiles on one 360, and each profile needn't have Xbox live. But you must be logged in to play games.</p><p>The game uses this profile for saving progress, records and other data, besides the most import use of having an Xbox Live persona. Each account has it's own settings and data for every game played with that profile.</p><p>So unlike PC games, ps2 or gamecube where each person would have a seperate save file for their data, all data is organized by profile, so if you want your stuff, you only need log in the 360 under your name and the system tells the game which file to load for you.</p><p>very impressive. data management is a snap.</p><p>The wireless controllers have a more user-friendly design than the wavebird controllers. Once you start up the machine, you hit the Xbox button on the controller. It'll assign itself to the xbox, and then light up part of the Xbox button showing which player number it is. This is also represented on the front of the 360 showing how many controllers the system recognizes.</p><p>I'm not quite sure what'll happen when you have 2 Xbox 360 consoles next to each other and attempt to register controllers.. I wonder how they solve this problem.</p><p>Aside from that, it REALLY REALLY REALLY annoys me that the Xbox 360 isn't backwards compatible with every Xbox game. I can play Fable, but i can't play Metal Slug 3 or Fatal Frame 2 or Panzer Dragoon Orta or Crazy Taxi 3. worthless... that was my saving grace for buying some of these games. i could play them now on other's xboxes, and later i can play them on my xbox 360. so much for that one.<br/>_________________</p><p>anyways, my roommate is a huge console fps fan, so naturally he picked up the Xbox 360's flagship title: Perfect Dark Zero.</p><p>PDZ is pretty dissapointing in my opinion. This opinion is pretty justified when my roommate came home last night with a copy of Quake 4 to play instead of this game.</p><p>Perfect Dark Zero is exactly the same game it was 5 years ago with alot of graphical upgrades. The AI will not use any clever tactics to try and take you down. An enemy will not think twice of walking into a room that has your gun fixed on the door. Every single time, i can pop outside and fire a clip. Then duck back into the room, and wait for their slow ass to run in the room, stand in front of me and wait a second for me to shoot them dead.</p><p>Not to mention that the character animation is so stoic, it looks like they used the same animation from the Nintendo 64 game. It feels exactly the same in appearance. how lazy can you be....</p><p>so far i've made it up through Mission number 5 at this point, and the story is absolutely cliche and horrible. Joanna is presented as Lara Croft clone with her veteran pal, Joe, presented as a Bruce Willis clone. Halo 1 and 2 are FAR more interesting than this game, even they are pretty cliche as well.</p><p>Playing this game is pretty annoying, but it's rather addicting at the same time..</p><p>The graphics haven't blown me away at all... there have been some things i've stopped to look it and thought, "that's looks pretty neat.." But then i turn away and get back to the mission. Most of the graphics are have pretty standard for Playstation 2, but the powerful lighting effects of the Xbox 360 pull everything together to give it a clean crisp shiny look.</p><p>On occasion though, the lighting effects look really hokey. Especially when you're infiltrating this chinese palace covered in snow. The snow gives off a blue hue in the moonlight night, but the orange from the fire defuses the reality and makes the enviroment look CG.<br/>____________</p><p>anyways... Perfect Dark Zero thus far has been pretty unimpressive, but it's still kinda fun.. from the purchase of Quake 4, it obviously won't hold over my roommate until Halo 3 comes out next year sometime.</p><p>I'd like to see some great games on the machine though. Fable 2 should be amazing. I really hope they bring Tetris the grand master stateside. I also look forward to Ninety-Nine Knights, Blue Dragoon, and a few other games.. maybe even Final Fantasy XI and Rumble Roses XX.</p><p>The Xbox 360 is pretty well designed, but it feels more like an Xbox 1.5 than a whole new system. The Xbox 360 graphics don't look ALL that better than the Xboxes.. for the time being, anyways..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to News and Recent Shmups" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/news-and-recent-shmups">News and Recent Shmups</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2005 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As the weeks continue to wash on by our lives, and the year almost comes to a close, my list of anticipated games becomes less anticipation, and more realization. Most of these games have come out and i have had a great time with ^_^.</p><p>Yesterday, another one of these gems finally came out: <b>Chaos Field</b> for the gamecube. Chaos Field is an updated port from the Dreamcast version which came out exactly one year ago.</p><p>Like most modern shooters, Chaos Field has it's own little quirks and variations on the genre. Many of these quirks are reminiscent of Ikaruga. After destroying enemies, energy cubes with fall from the foe that will fill up your energy meter to the side of the screen. You can use your energy meter for 2 different types of attacks. One attack will lock onto your enemies and attack them with a seeking ray. The other one, though, is shield that will absorb bullets around you.</p><p>One of the more basic maneuvers of your ship, besides firing bullets, is using your sword. The sword can attack your opponent, but also absorb all standard bullets around you, which doesn't make bullet dodging particularly easier.</p><p>The real joy of Chaos Field is change. When beginning a level and in standard combat, you are fighting in the Order Field. At, roughly, any point in time, you change this from Order to Chaos. All of your attacks and defenses become more powerful, however the enemy's attacks become far more rampant. Attacks are more various than in order, hence the name.. chaos. With this addition to the gameplay, you are really playing two different versions of the game.</p><p>You can choose between 3 different ships with very different attacks. Hal's ship is the standard bullet firing ship, which has a static shield for defense. Isumi's ship has some very weak homing lasers, and rotating fire balls for defense. (and) Jinn's ship has a very powerful yet infrequent energy blast.</p><p>Much like modern shooters, Chaos Field awards big points to those who use the combo system correctly. In order to rack up combo points, you must use your energy defense and attacks very frequently to destroy your opponent.</p><p>It's pretty fun, but what really annoys me about the game is each stage is just a solitary boss. For each part of the stage, you're just damaging the boss, bit by bit, until it's completely destroyed. There are no lackies that you can easily destroy, or difficult stage that you must venture through in order to reach the boss. It just all boss fights. oh well.</p><p>The graphics aren't really mind-blowing. In fact, they aren't really mind-blowing for Dreamcast graphics.. They are pretty standard graphics that the Nintendo 64 could probably handle. In one instance, during the second part of the first stage, you're flying right next to a building while battling another ship. The textures for this building is black with bright blue lights indicating windows, which considerably gets in the way of dodging bullets of the same color. I almost get a headache trying to focus on the bullets in front of this background.. luckily i'm not seizure prone.</p><p>but.. as stated above, it's pretty fun and quite challenging. I wouldn't recommend this anyone, though. I'd give it a <font color="red">3 out of 5</font>. If you want a shooter on the gamecube, you need not look further than Ikaruga. However, if you're a fan of shooters, be sure to check it out. ^_^ It's a mere $30 at your local gamestop.</p><p>I'm pretty satisfied with it. In most instances, a Shooter is a Shooter is a Shooter.<br/>____________________________</p><p>As mentioned above the original Chaos Field came out on Dreamcast on Dec 14, 2004 in japan, which might be surprising.. The dreamcast is pretty well dead, but thanks to hardcore shooter fans it still breeds new life. Chaos Field is not the dreamcast's final game though..</p><p>Just this past April, Trizeal was released on the dreamcast as well. Ironically enough, it's limited release outsold a very bad PSP game released on the same day.</p><p>http://spamm.org/viewtopic.php?t=2947</p><p>News from a few days ago, indicated that even Trizeal will not be the dreamcast's final game.. Milestone, the creators of Chaos Field, have another shooter coming to the short-lived system. Radilgy will be released on February 16th, 2006.</p><p>Unfortuantely it's very difficult to find information on this game, but from a few screenshots it looks cell-shaded?.. :shrugs:<br/>____________________________</p><p>This news was pretty neat ^_^ and it reminded me of an article i read several weeks ago that caught my eye.</p><p>Alfa Systems announced that Shikigami no Shiro III (Castle Shikigami III) has been in development for a while and will be released in Japanese arcades by February 2006. Alfa Systems has developed all 3 shikigami no shiro games, and also developed Elemental Gearbolt.</p><p>Shikigami no Shiro is a pretty standard shooters with it's own little quirks as well. It has coined the phrase Bullet Hugging, where if your character comes within a certain range right next to a bullet, their attacks become twice as strong.</p><p>The shikigami series is probably known to have the worse localization of any game to date thanks to XS games. Back in 2003, they got their hands on the NA distribution rights to Gunbird and Shikigami 1. They completely gutted the games and slapped on a new title for these completely unrelated games. Gunbird was now Mobile Light Force on playstation, and Shikigami 1 was now Mobile Light Force 2 on playstation 2. In Shikigami, all the cutscenes and character defining traits were taken out of the game, leaving only the core gameplay. With a new name, the game was given an "appriopriate" cover art...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/B0006OK384.03.LZZZZZZZ.webp" /></p><p>compared to..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/Shikigami_no_Shiro.webp" /></p><p>horrible... ugh.</p><p>but XS games had learned the error of their ways when getting the NA distribution rights to Shikigami 2 and released it with everything in tact, including horrible voice acting.<br/>__________________</p><p>anyways.. i'll bring Chaos Field to the LAN party tonight for people to check out.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/25">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/23">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
