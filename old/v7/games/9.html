| August 23, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The annual Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle is this weekend.  This has been creeping up on me.  After moving into a new apartment, the last few weeks have been busy and just flew by, and I almost forgot about this.</p><p>At the beginning of August, they released the panel schedule, and over the last few weeks, game studios have been issuing press releases on all the games they plan on having in the exhibition hall.  Everything seems to be coming together, and I'm definitely excited.</p><p>Here's some of the panels (and events) that I plan on attending...</p><p><b>1up Presents: Retronauts v. Your Fondest Memories</b> - Friday 3pm @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Although I don't listen to retronauts anymore, their live podcasts are always great.  Jeremy Parish and Chris Kohler have an incredible wealth of gaming knowledge, and they're joined by Jeff Green this year, which should add some extra humor to the mix.</p><p><b>Minecraft Adventure Update Q&A and Demo</b> - Friday 3pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch hosts a Q&A for the upcoming Minecraft 1.8 patch, and plays through a demo.</p><p><b>After Party w/ The Protomen</b> - Friday 8pm @ El Corazon<br/>An intimate after party with one of the best video game music groups!  Openers include Jonny Nero Action Hero, and Klopfenpop.  Hosted by Fangamer.</p><p><b>Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'</b> - Saturday 10:30am @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Though I'm not really fan of Destructoid people, Ashley and Anthony Burch, along with their father, form a hilarious sibling rivalry over specific games.</p><p><b>Irrational Games</b> - Saturday 2pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>It's been over one year that Irrational Games unveiled their upcoming title BioShock Infinite, the pseudo sequel/prequel to their 2007 hit game BioShock.  The panel is lead by Ken Levine as he discusses the development process, what we're seen already of BioShock Infinite, and they'll probably play through the E3 demo on stage.</p><p><b>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b> - Saturday 3:30pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>One of the biggest and most hyped games of this upcoming season is the new Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim.  Bethesda devs take the stage, and most likely will run through the QuakeCon demo on stage.  Super excited for this one.</p><p><b>Square Enix Presents...</b> - Saturday 7pm @ Pegasus Theatre<br/>Squaresoft is heading a panel as well, and they will be unveiling a brand new title.  This title is Airtight Games upcoming FPS from creative director Kim Swift (creator of Portal, and director of the Left 4 Dead games).  While I don't give a shit about Square anymore, I'm quite a fan of Kim Swift.  Can't wait to see what it is.</p><p><b>Minecraft Griefer Party</b> - Sunday 5:30pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch is tearing down the Minecraft booth and giving away pieces of it as souvenirs.</p><p>Nothing else really caught my eye.  It seemed like there were a lot more interesting panels at PAX East this year (<a href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced" title="/pax-east-panels-announced">reference</a>).  It's also annoying that there isn't a Chiptune showcase.</p><p>But that's fine.  My time at PAX is almost always spent in the exhibition rooms standing in lines waiting for games.  This year there is a huge amount of upcoming games I'm interested in and all of them plan to be at PAX.  These include <b>House of the Dead</b>, <b>Team ICO Collection</b>, <b>Elder Scrolls Skyrim</b>, and <b>Zelda Skyward Sword</b>.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml">this list</a>, there will also be indie game <b>Fez</b>, upcoming Suda 51 / James Gunn game <b>Lollipop Chainsaw</b>, <b>Batman Arkham City</b>, <b>Mass Effect 3</b>, Grasshopper published titles <b>Sine Mora</b> and <b>Black Knight Sword</b>, and Sony will have <b>Playstation Vita</b> units to demo too.  Mojaang (Minecraft) has a booth too!</p><p>It should be an amazing fun time.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Added stuff about Minecraft from their <a href="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/" title="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/">schedule</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Child of Eden" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/child-of-eden">Child of Eden</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On a console that sees release after release of first person shooters in a war setting, or in a space setting, Child of Eden finds itself among a very different crowd.  It's about as opposite as you can get from all that.  It is a unique gaming experience that takes you on a journey of sights, sounds, and color.  Brilliant vibrant colors.</p><p>What Tetsuya Mizuguchi began with Rez in 2001/2002, he has continued with Child of Eden.  The visually stimulating and pulsing background bores its creatures.  On screen, you target these creatures and shapes with the crosshairs, lock on to them, and fire your weapons.  You also have smart bombs, that take care of all the enemies on the screen at once.  Child of Eden adds a third weapon: rapid fire.  Only rapid fire can take down incoming enemy fire, and some enemies are only vulnerable to rapid fire.</p><p>Both Rez and Child of Eden seem rather easy on the surface.  Point and Shoot, right?  It goes a little deeper than that.  In Rez, you start building up massive points if fire all your locked-on shots at once.  Child of Eden continues this scoring method, but adds in a little twist.  You need to fire your shots along with the beat in order to build up your multiplyer.  Rez did this automatically for you.  Once I figured this out, Child of Eden became a much more aesthetically pleasing game.  Music games always sound their best when you play them correctly.  :)</p><p>While this game is a beautiful work of art, I never really felt the same excitement and wonder I did when I first played Rez over 9 years ago.  Rez absolutey blew me away on that winter day in January 2002.  Each level had a unique feel.  It's music was raw, dynamic, and told a story of its own.  While Child of Eden's music has a few dynamic sequences, it feel mostly flat and generic.</p><p>Rez used tracks from established artists, and pulled together 6 songs that had variety and cohesion.  The music behind Child of Eden is a much different story, and barely mentioned anywhere.   It's really just an interactive visualization for the Genki Rockets.</p><div class='title'><b>Genki Rockets</b></div><p>The Genki Rockets is a group formed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi starring a fictional lead singer, Lumi, who is a hologram (much like Sharon Apple from Macross Plus).  It's known now that the lead singer is portrayed by Rachel Rhodes, but whatever.  Also in the group is music producer Kenji Tamai.  All other members are secret, apparently.</p><p>The group began in 2006 when Mizuguchi wrote the song "Heavenly Star", made a colorful video, and posted it to youtube.  It went viral, and became a huge success.</p><p>Like all other J-Pop groups who have fictional characters as band members, they have a detailed back story, and this is the same story that sets up Child of Eden.  Lumi is the first human born in space on September 11th, 2019 (NEVER FORGET).  She expresses her thoughts and feelings through songs, and sends them as messages to earth.</p><p>The Genki Rockets have a unique live performance involving the visual component as highly as the audio.  Since Lumi is in space, and has never been to earth, her appearance is projected on stage using hologram-like technology.  The wikipedia articles states the technology is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner">Musion Eyeliner</a>, which is basically just using a large LED screen that gives the appearance of projecting.</p><p>They really don't have that many songs.  "Heavenly Star" premiered in 2006, and was featured in Lumines II.  In 2007, the recorded a couple more singles, and in 2008, they recorded enough to release an album.  They really haven't done a whole lot up until now.  Here's their tracklist for Child of Eden:</p><p>Stage 1 - Matrix - <b>Fly!</b> (2008)<br/>Stage 2 - Evolution - <b>Star Line</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 3 - Beauty - <b>Breeze</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 4 - Passion - <b>Maker</b> (2011)<br/>Stage 5 - Journey - <b>Heavenly Star</b> (2006) &amp; <b>Flow</b> (2011)</p><p>Check out their website: <a href="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/" title="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/">Genki Rockets dot Com</a>.  They have a live streamed concert on Ustream happening on Tuesday!</p><div class='title'><b>Extended Story</b></div><p>Child of Eden expands on Lumi's story.  With her music, mankind is inspired to explore the vast reaches of outer space.  With their exploration, the Internet expands and grows.  The Internet can be accessed anywhere humans have reached.  And the Internet is renamed to Eden.  Eden is the fountain that which all knowledge flows.</p><p>In the 23rd century, humans rebuild Lumi's likeness and personality in Eden.  Project Lumi nears completion, but is compremised by a virus attack.  And this is where you come in.  Protect Lumi, and complete the project.</p><p>Incidentally, the story of Rez picks up after Lumi is completed.  Later on, Lumi becomes the central AI for Eden and controls the flow of information.  However, the information is vast, and the task becomes overwhelming.  Lumi shuts down, and exposes Eden to all manor of virus attacks.  In Rez, you explore from your local areas of Eden to the central mainframes.  You take down rouge programs and viruses, while rebooting Lumi and restoring order.</p><p>It's rather interesting how Child of Eden portrays the future Internet as a lush utopia of wonder and beauty.  While the future beyond that in Rez is dark and crippled.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Child of Eden seems like the ultimate goal of Mizuguchi's plan for the Genki Rockets.  I really wonder at what point did that plan began.  Unfortunately I'm not as familiar as I should be with his works.  I consider myself a fan, but I haven't played anything of his since Rez.</p><p>After leaving Sega in 2003, he formed Q? Entertainment, and they've made Meteos, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and Gunpey.  Lumines is their huge money maker, and it makes heavy use of music.  Is all that music licensed?  or is it all original tracks developed in house?  I should play that game.</p><p>I wonder if the Genki Rockets was just some weekend project.  He got some of his pals together, jammed, and wrote a song.  Then he started working on the video, and then posted it to see what some of his fans thought.  With its huge viral success, he probably just wanted to see how far he could take it.</p><p>Then again, the Genki Rockets had all their fame in 2006 to 2008.  They sat on the back burner for 3 years until now with Child of Eden.  And you barely see the name "Genki Rockets" anywhere.  Mizuguchi is just retconning Rez to be canon with his washed up JPop band.</p><p>I'd be real interested to know the actual story behind all of this.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Super Potato Osaka" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/super-potato-osaka">Super Potato Osaka</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Their devotion to retro titles is difficult to match in Japan, and if you've ever been in one of their locations, it's quick to see why.</p><p>My little brother and I just returned from a two week vacation in Osaka, Japan and had the pleasure is visiting Super Potato located in Den Den Town.  Den Den Town is a special shopping arcade that stretches along the main street in the ward of Nipponbashi.  It focuses purely on electronics, which extend to video games, anime, movies, figures, and almost all other corners of nerd culture.  Some refer to it as the Akihabara of Osaka.</p><p>Super Potato is very easy to find.  In fact, we really just stumbled onto it, rather than having to search for it.  It sits proudly in the middle of Den Den Town on the west side, and has a big 'ol Mario out front.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3553_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3553_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3553_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>On the first floor are all the current and relavant consoles.  Playstation 3, Playstation 2, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo Wii, Gamecube, and so forth.  But upstairs is the true treasure.

| May 20, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Watchin' Faces, Solvin' Cases.</p><p>I got L.A.Noire in the mail last night, and couldn't help myself but play a few hours and introduce myself to Rockstar's newest title.</p><p>I went through all the "tutorial" missions, and completed my first full case. The tutorials were rather linear and localized. Once I got to the first case, the world really opened up, and the GTA nature of Rockstar games came to light. After completing the first case, the next case started immediately, which was somewhat dissapointing. It felt very linear, but maybe later on they'll give you a choice of different cases to follow and accomplish.</p><p>When solving a case, you most collect evidence from the crime scene, interview witnesses, and follow the clues. The clues will bring you to different locations in 1947 Los Angeles, and the case continues to unfold. The first case ended rather predictably, and there really wasn't much variation. Though, I'm sure that later cases will have multiple valid endings.</p><p>It's actually pretty fun. It's very much in the same vain of your Ace Attorney titles, except completely presented as an open world Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>I was somewhat bored with it last night, but the more and more I think about it this morning, the more and more I want to return to the world of Cole Phelps.<br/>____</p><p>It's pretty similar to Heavy Rain. You definitely do a lot of the same things in the same manor, such as interrogation and crime scene searching, but it doesn't feel the same. I'm not really sure why...</p><p>Crime scene searching is nearly identical. As you walk around, the controller will vibrate if there's a clue nearby. Your character picks it up, and can twist and twirl it around to look for specifics. If it's relevant, you make a note of it in your crime log. These clues can be used as evidence later on when interrogating people.</p><p>Interrogations involve a list of questions in your crime book. You ask a question, and the person gives a response. You have 3 options. You either believe them (truth), or doubt them, or call them a liar. I'm having trouble telling the difference between Doubt and Lie. But from what I can tell, you can call them a liar if you have definitive evidence their statement is false. You can doubt them if you think their statement is false, but have no real evidence to back it up.</p><p>What's hilarious is as your detective level goes up, you can use a "life-line" to help you choose truth/doubt/lie. Using a point will take a way an answer. You can also "phone a friend" by using points to see what the Rockstar Social Club recommends. :)</p><p>I guess it reminds me more of Phoenix Wright, rather than Heavy Rain because Heavy Rain felt more fluid and natural. Phoenix Wright and L.A.Noire have a very apparent game-y layer for the investigation and interrogation that does not suspend my disbelief. But you still do the same type of things in all 3 games.<br/>____</p><p>It's hard to not say this is some kind of a GTA clone, since it is open world and made by Rockstar.</p><p>While GTA is totally open world, and you can pretty much do anything at any time, L.A.Noire feels more restrictive. Between Case 1 and Case 2, there was no leisure time, or even an option to choose Case 2. In that manor, it feels less open, and far more mission oriented. I feel like I'm wasting time, when I'm driving off to stop a random street crime, search for hidden cars, or find historical landmarks. Also, since you're playing a cop, you don't really have much the full spectrum of morality choice. It's kinda like Mass Effect in that way, where you're either play Captain Picard or Dirty Hairy. You're still on the good side of the law. And you can't change that.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: DDR edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">Games I buy: DDR edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As a game collector, you eventually come across a game that you simply cannot find.  A game that's not necessary rare, but uncommon.  The only distinction between the two being demand.  This particular game for me is (was) Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.</p><p>DDR Party Collection was released in Dec 2003 as a follow-up and compliment to DDR Extreme.  The arcade version of DDR Extreme had so many songs that the home release couldn't contain them all and they released two games.  DDR Extreme had all the new original songs, plus some favorites.  While DDR Party Collection contained the bulk of the favorites and classics they couldn't pack into DDR Extreme.  It used the exact same engine as DDR Extreme, and had just as many songs!</p><p>We played this game a few times at DDR Nights in college, as Tony had a ROM copy, but I wished someday to own a legitimate copy.   Throughout my Study Abroad in Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  Throughout my yearly vacations to Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  I eventually gave up and decided to buy a copy off ebay, but they were no longer listed!  No one was selling.</p><p>It was <b>one year ago yesterday</b> that I finally found a copy.  My 6 year long quest had finally come to its end in Kumamoto.  And it was a fated encounter...</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto</b></div><p>After Dave and I visited Kagoshima, we traveled North to Kumamoto.  Kumamoto is Kyushu's central prefecture, and it's focal point is the gigantic castle in the dead center of town.  Dave and I were able to visit the castle, but only 30-40 minutes before it closed.  Afterward, we wondered what to do.</p><p>On my map, I had one location written down which was a Geo (video game store) not too far east of the Capitol.  We ventured down the castle hill, and made it to the train station.  We passed some delicious looking restaurants on the way there, but wanted to ensure we got on the train.  When we got to the train station, the train wasn't scheduled to arrive for another 20 or 30 minutes, so we backtracked to this interesting hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</p><div class='title'><b>Choboiyaki</b></div><p>This restaurant served Okonomiyaki, but it's not the type you would expect.  It was definitely prepared in a similar manner, but the pancake was HUGE.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp"  /></p><p>The radius of this pancake is about as large as the diameter should be.  She piled on the cabbage, and smashed it all down into form.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp"  /></p><p>The pancake was flipped over, folded, and cut up into servable pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp"  /></p><p>And like all Okonomiyaki, it was absolutely delicious.  Between her semi-decent english and my horrible Japanese, we were able to talk a little bit about what she was actually making...</p><p>Japan may look somewhat small, especially compared to the United States, but it is incredibly diverse.  As a country, Japan grew from isolation, and that isolation spread to its culture, and it culture is known for taking elements of other culture, assimilating them, and expanding on them.  So you get plenty of local cultural traits you won't find anywhere else.  And this especially applies to food.</p><p>This particular version of Okonomiyaki is only local to Kumamoto and is known as Choboiyaki.  At least I think that's what she said.  Here's a pic of the menu with the name on it: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp">Image!</a>.  Maybe it's just Choboyaki...  or Chobomiyaki, except the 'ya' fire kanji immediately follows 'chobo'.  I dunno...</p><div class='title'><b>Off to Geo</b></div><p>That stuff was delicious and unique, but it's off to the game store to kill time.  I'm sure Dave was somewhat bored with my over-attentive scrutiny of searching every single game they owned, so I didn't go through absolutely everything.  I searched PS2 games and found nothing.  I skimmed PS1, skimmed Saturn, searched Dreamcast, and that was pretty much it.  I couldn't quit find the Rhythm game section for PS2, but didn't want to bore Dave that much more.</p><p>Though, on my way out, Beatmania caught my eye.  "Hold on a second.." I said as I crotched down to take a look, and HOLY CRAP!  What do you know!  It just so happened that they had a copy of DDR Party Collection on the shelf.  I was pretty surprised, as I had never seen this game in the wild.  Though, I didn't get my hopes completely up, as in the past, I happened across a game on the shelf, and they ultimated didn't actually have it in stock.</p><p>I took the case to the counter as my only purchase.  They went around the corner to search through their PS2 games, and didn't seem to immediately find it.  The two girls came back to the counter to take a look at the case again and noticed something they had missed on first glance.  They went to the back and came back with this:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp"  /></p><p>Exclamation point!  Not only did they have a copy of the game, they had the limited edition release of the game that came with a dance pad, complete with bucket.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp"  /></p><p>I looked closer at the sales label (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp">pictured here</a>), and it had the sale date as Dec 11th, 2003.  Not only did they have this in their possesion, but it's been since RELEASE DAY!  It had waited for 6 1/2 years collecting dust and being constantly passed up but patrons until I came through the doors.  One of the games I've been searching for 6 years, and I found a release copy NEW.</p><p>This is fate.  I immediately bought it.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a bucket of DDR turned into a slight difficulty considering Dave and I packed VERY lightly for our trip.  I had no room for this thing in my luggage.  But how could I not keep this thing that I was destined to own!</p><p>Well, I don't need the crappy DDR pad.  So, I threw that in the trash.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp"  /></p><p>I stuff the bucket full of my dirty clothes</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp"  /></p><p>And doing so gave me plenty of room to store in my luggage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp"  /></p><p>Perfect!</p><p>And so my quest ends.  The game that took me the longest time to find was finally found.  (Actually, I guess that's not true, as I've been searching for a copy of Snatcher on Sega CD since the late 90s.)  With DDR Party in hand, my PS2 DDR Collection is complete.  I have all the games I want. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-ds-carrying-case-puppet">Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 22, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Nintendo's new handheld, the Nintendo 3DS is set for release this Sunday.  And I've had one on preorder ever since they've announced the price and release date.  I wrote something a few weeks ago about how excited I was about it: <a href="/old/v7/nintendo-3ds" title="/nintendo-3ds">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=829</a>.  I wasn't excited for the 3D so much, as I was to finally have a second DS for trading of Pokemon.</p><p>This week, the gaming press have gotten their review units, and have written some reviews and comments about the handheld.  There have been 2 concerns that are starting to make me doubt whether I should purchase the Nintendo 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Battery Life</b></div><p>Apparently, if you're using the Nintendo 3DS under the lowest settings without any 3D, you can only get about 4 1/2 hours worth of game time out of it!  And then it takes about 3 1/2 hours to fully charge the thing.  This is ridiculous compared to my DS Lite, which I can play for hours and hours, and never think to charge it.</p><p>How is the Nintendo 3DS supposed to be a handheld if I'm always tethered to an electrical outlet?  How is this supposed to work if when I go to on a long vacation and want to play through Okamiden, or Zelda Spirit Tracks?  I'll be constantly charging the stupid thing.</p><p>Source from Ars Technica: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars" title="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars</a></p><div class='title'><b>DS Rendering</b></div><p>The 3DS screens have higher resolution as the DS.  As such, if you're playing a DS in full screen mode, the image is stretched and the pixels are not 1 to 1.  You can fix this by running DS games in their native resolution, but it is small.  Almost, Gameboy Micro small.  Also, according to the Destructoid article, the colors are slightly washed out.  DS games look much more brilliant on a DSi or a DSi XL.</p><p>This would really hamper my experience with the 3DS for the first several months as I will be using it to play DS games.  With the added processing power of the 3DS, you'd think they make the games look better, much like the Playstation 2 did with PS1 games.</p><p>Source from Destructoid: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml">http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml</a><br/>Also, Kotaku or Joystiq wrote the exact same thing a few weeks ago.</p><div class='title'><b>Buy or not Buy</b></div><p>So now, I'm a little torn.  It seems like if I get a 3DS, I will still be using my DS quite often.  I might only use the 3DS for 3DS games (of which none I care about), or the built in games (which are not full games, but little time wasters), or the eStore (which won't even be ready by launch).</p><p>Let's take a look at a timeline.</p><p>November 21st, 2004 - Nintendo DS<br/>June 11th, 2006 - Nintendo DS Lite<br/>April 5th, 2009 - Nintendo DSi<br/>March 29th, 2010 - Nintendo DSi XL</p><p>March 27th, 2010 - Nintendo 3DS</p><p>With the release of each recent handheld, they've had another one fixing problems not too long after.  With the original horrid ugly looking DS, they replaced that thing with the pretty DS Lite a year and a half later.  The DS Lite fixed all the design problems they had with the DS.  It improved battery life, full LCD screens, in a smaller, more compact design.  I did not own a DS until the DS Lite was released, and by then, there was an actual reason to own one.</p><p>Given the uproar about the current battery life of the Nintendo 3DS, I doubt it'll take long before they come up with the solution.  I should really wait for that solution rather than spending $250 on something that might end up sitting on my shelf for the months to come.</p><p>If anything, the release of the Nintendo 3DS should bring down the price of used DSs.  Maybe I'll pick up a DSi XL.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space Extraction + Severed" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space-extraction-severed">Dead Space Extraction + Severed</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 7, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dead Space Extraction</b></div><p>In 2009, the now Visceral Games produced a Dead Space spinoff named Extraction.  It was a Wii title, and it was an on-rails shooter.  What better direction for the series than to make this moody adventure game into a fast paced action game.  And then to release it on a platform that has the least amount of your fan base.  I'm not really sure why they thought this was a good idea.  And it seems they won't make that mistake again as it horribly tanked in sales.</p><p>Being a fan of Dead Space, I had eventual plans to buy it.  My local Wal*mart always has copies, and I would probably take the plunge once the price point hit $20.  But last year's E3 came with some amazing news.  With the upcoming release of the Playstation Move, Visceral was upscaling the graphics, and including the game FOR FREE with each initial copy of Dead Space 2!</p><p>And thank god it was free.  I finished it the other day, and $20 is still a bit much.  It's a decent on-rails shooter, but the name "Dead Space" brings in some very weighted expectations.  Dead Space is a very solitary experience.  It's a game that crawls into your head and exercises your ears.  Most enemies are taken on a few at a time, and using the environment can lend itself well to taking down swarms of them.</p><p>An on-rails shooter is the exact opposite of that.  Enemies pop up, and you shoot them down.  Hit the weak spot for massive damage.  Bang bang bang!  Also, now it's two player! No longer a solitary experience. And you're always running around in a group of two to five people.</p><p>I am glad I played though it, though.  Story-wise, Dead Space Extraction takes place directly before Dead Space 1.  You play several characters on the surface of Aegis VII (or whatever) when the outbreak occurs.  You find a couple of survivors, escape the surface of the planet to the Ishimura, and then eventually escape the Ishimura.  It sets up a couple things in Dead Space 1, and ends almost right as the next game begins.</p><p>It's fun to see some of the expanded universe of Dead Space, but I don't really find the story all that interesting.  Hurrah, there's a dangerous space object that turns people crazy and into monsters.  It's really just background setup for the game's senario.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 2 Severed</b></div><p>So anyway, most of your characters in Extraction survive past the end, but their stories aren't over.  Last week, Visceral released an $8 expansion for Dead Space 2 entitled Severed, which continues the tale of two characters from Extraction.  They both happen to be on Titan while Isaac is running around killing things.  You play soldier Gabe Weller, as he tries to make it to his Wife, Luxine.</p><p>Severed is actually pretty amazing.  It's tight and short story that brings together all the aspects I love about Dead Space.  As you're running through the mines, separate areas are distinct by the sounds of the loud, nearby machinery.  The environment actually uses your senses to spook you, rather than scare tactics.  And the story actually adds a little depth to the Dead Space universe.</p><p>It's definitely worth playing.</p><div class='title'><b>The Universe</b></div><p>Besides these games, EA has done a whole lot with the Dead Space IP.  There's a couple other games, plus a few movies and books too.  I haven't touched any of that crap.  But, given my investment into the series already, I might consider checking more of this stuff out.</p><p>Dead Space Ignition - PSN Title and prequel to Dead Space 2<br/>Dead Space Downfall - Animated film that takes place in between Extraction and Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Aftermath - Animated film that takes place after Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Comic Book - A Comic Book that takes place before Downfall<br/>Dead Space Martyr - A novel that focuses on the Unitology religion.<br/>Dead Space Salvage - A Comic book that takes place some time between Dead Space 1 and 2.</p><p>I think this shows how poor the story of Dead Space is. All of these spin-offs center around the events in the game itself.  The only real universe building they've done is that novel which centers on the Unitology religion that keep coming back to.  Everything else is basically "and then this happened!" rather than "and this is why it happened."<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo 3DS" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-3ds">Nintendo 3DS</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 2, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Nintendo 3DS was released in Japan over last weekend, and only 26 days until its release in the states.  I have had mine preordered since Nintendo announced the price and release date, and I am super excited.  Not necessarily because of the 3D capabilties, nor any of the games, but mostly as a replacement for my Nintendo DS Lite.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo DS Lite</b></div><p>My Nintendo DS was part of the second release wave of the Nintendo DS Lite in Japan, almost 5 years ago.  I wasn't initially into the DS, mostly because of the aesentics.  It looked like a frampy piece of tech designed around the chipset inside.  There really weren't that many games for it either.</p><p>When they unveiled the sleak and sexy design of the DS Lite, it completely turned around my opinion.  By that time, there were games that were actually worth my time.  Tetris DS, Phoenix Wright, Electroplankton and Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow were the first games I owned for the handheld, and still remain as some of the best game offered for the platform.</p><p>Over the past 5 years, I have played my Nintendo DS so much that the touch screen can no longer be correctly configured.  Games like Trauma Center and Ouendan are unplayable.  It's time for an upgrade.</p><p>Last year, I planned on replacing my DS with one of those DSi XLs.  Unfortunately, Nintendo made an incredibly stupid PR move.  One week before the DSi XL were to be released in the states, they announced the Nintendo 3DS.  The successor to the DS platform.  I was all set to replace my DS with a $190 DSi XL, and they lost my money.  Upgrading to the new platform is a much more lucrative prospect.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo 3DS</b></div><p>And now we're just 26 days away!  While there really aren't any launch titles that interest me, there are several on the horizon I care about: Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D, Professor Layton v. Phoenix Wright, Megaman Legends 3 and the newly announced Super Mario title.  There's also plenty of DSi Ware games that I haven't had a chance to play having never owned a DSi.</p><p>But!  What really interests me are the built games and features of the 3DS.  You can capture 3D photos and film. There are augmented reality games to play.  There's a built in pedometer that unlock rewards.  And there's a thing called <b>Street Pass</b>.</p><p>The Street Pass is a communication sensor that will connect to any other 3DSs you may pass by throughout your day.  It will transfer your Mii to them, and their Mii to you.  Besides building a social gaming web of your daily life, you can use these Miis with two built-in games: a Puzzle game and a Quest game.  For the puzzle game, Each Mii you meet you can exchange jigsaw puzzle pieces, and form some random Nintendo images.  In the Quest game, each Mii will take on monsters in a dungeon until they're scared off.</p><p>Here's a video showing off the Street Pass stuff: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ</a>.</p><p>I would expect conventions and other massive nerd gatherings to be invaluable towards building a huge list of stranger's Miis.  PAX West this year should be fantastic. ^_^</p><p>Anyway, I'm excited.  Though, I'll mostly use the 3DS to play DS titles.  Namely Pokemon.  Now that I'll have two DSs, I can trade Pokemon back and forth between my games willy nilly, and not need to borrow a friend's.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/10">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/8">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
