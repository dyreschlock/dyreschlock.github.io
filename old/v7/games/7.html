| November 29, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I went to the Pokemon Center in Nagoya to grab that Shiny Tyranitar they are currently giving away.  Though, unlike previous mystery gifts, you had to receive it via connection to the Internet, rather than local wireless..  which is somewhat curious.</p><div class='title'><b>Mystery Gifts</b></div><p>First off, there are 3 ways you can receive mystery gifts in the recent Pokemon games:  Internet, local wireless, and serial codes.</p><p>Serial Codes are new with the Gen VI games.  You input a 16-digital code.  The game verifies the code online.  And then it'll give you the gift.  There are two kinds of codes, too: unique and non-unique.  Unique codes are strictly one-time use.  Once the code is used, it can no longer be used by anyone.  Non-unique codes can be used once per game.  If code hasn't expired, anyone is able to receive that gift.</p><p>One nice thing about unique codes is that you can receive repeat events as long as you have multiple codes for that event.</p><p>Connecting to the Internet for gifts has been around since Gen IV.  If Nintendo is currently holding an event, just connect online, and receive the gift!  Simple.  Though, one thing to note is that is tied to whatever region your game is from.  US games can only download US events, and so on.</p><p>Gifts distribute via local wireless connections have been already since Gen III on the GBA.  Though at that time, you needed to own the wireless adapter.  To receive these gifts, you must be within proximity of the wireless network in order to make a connection, and download the gift.</p><p>Prior to that, there were other shenanigans required to receive gifts, but the always revolved on your showing up to the event in person.  The local wireless gifts are the modern evolution of that.</p><div class='title'><b>Gen VI Local Wireless Events</b></div><p>Japan has a shit-load of local events throughout the year where you can receive plenty of unique gifts that almost never come to the states.  As mentioned above, the current event is a Shiny Tyranitar.</p><p>Every local event in Japan has been region free for me.  I've been able to receive the event pokemon on both my Japanese games and US games.  Receiving these events have had an interesting effect, too.  Whichever region these Pokemon were received in, becomes the region of that Pokemon.  Even though these events are Japanese, receiving it on my English game creates an English Pokemon, rather than a Japanese one.</p><p>Though, for some reason, this method changed with this Shiny Tryanitar</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo Zone</b></div><p>At the Pokemon Center, rather than collecting the Tyranitar over local wireless, you had to connect through the Internet to receive it.  Specifically, your 3DS had to connect to the Nintendo Zone Wi-Fi network, and download the mystery gift through the Internet.  As I mentioned before, it's a curious change.</p><p>Through wireless, the only authentication done has been on the client-side, or on the 3DS itself.  The wireless signal simply broadcasts when the box is turned on, and does nothing else.  The 3DS searches for any signals.  When it finds one, it does a quick compatibility check, and then either accepts or denies it.</p><p>This new route has a lot more handshaking.  First, on the system level of the 3DS, it must connect to the Internet through the Nintendo Zone.  If the wireless mode is turned on, the 3DS does this automatically.  When connecting through the Internet, the 3DS will send a bunch of information about your game and 3DS through the Internet to Nintendo.  On the server-side, Nintendo will do all the authentication.  Then, Nintendo will decide whether or not to allow you to have the mystery gift.</p><p>One thing that Nintendo authenticates on the server-side is region.  I was not able to download the Tyranitar on the English version of game.  Only the Japanese version worked.  So, I was only able to get one mystery gift, instead of two.</p><p>Yeah, yeah..  boo-hoo, and all that.  But, it's a very interesting change.</p><div class='title'><b>Why?</b></div><p>Because of the region blocking, this allows the event Pokemon to retain their intended region.  The Tyranitar I downloaded from a Japanese event can only be a Japanese Pokemon now.  But, I think that's really just an unintended side effect.</p><p>Because of all the authentication done on the server-side and system level, this allows for a lot more security, which prevents any problems caused by piracy.  If you had some way of receiving the signal outside of the 3DS, now, there's no way you could download a million copies of the event Pokemon.</p><p>Additionally, this gives more control to Nintendo for distributing events.  Back at HQ, they only need to flip one switch on and off, rather than each distribution center having that power.  Everything can be handled at a central location.  Also, distribution centers need not worry about handling any extra hardware on their end.  Only the Nintendo Zone, which is really just a router.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it seems that Nintendo of America recently did this for their Hoopa distribution.  To receive that Pokemon, you had to connect through Nintendo Zone at McDonalds.</p><p><u>Update (3/18)</u>: There's an event going on right now for a Shiny Ho-oh at Pokemon Centers.  But for this event, it goes through Wireless, rather than Internet.  I figured that would continue with the Internet going forward, but I guess they went back to wireless.  Weird.. why?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Castlevania 2 Simons Quest (Japan)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/castlevania-2-simons-quest-japan">Castlevania 2 Simons Quest (Japan)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 16, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Recently, I've been playing a lot of Castlevania 2 on the 3DS Virtual Console.</p><p>As a kid, I thought this game was absolutely impenetrable, but after seeing some other people playing it, and looking at a map of the world.  It's actually not that bad.  In fact, it's probably the easiest Castlevania ever made.</p><p>I bought and played through the US version.  After I finished it, I wanted to try out the Japanese version, so I downloaded that on my Japanese 3DS.  There are some interesting differences.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" /></p><p>First off, when it was originally released in Japan, Castlevania 2 was a Famicom Disk game, rather than a cartridge.  The 3DS game emulates the loading effects of the game, too, so every time to switch areas in the game, it's accompanied by a 3-4 second loading screen.</p><p>Also, the music is absolute trash.  It the same music as the US version, but without several added "instruments" that create the iconic tracks everyone knows from the game.  It's really weird listening to it.  </p><p>The Japanese version sounds and feels so incomplete.  It's so weird that they completely dropped the ball on the translation for the US version.  They clearly spent time fixing the other problems with the game.</p><p>Along with the translation, the ending of the Japanese version is WAY more complete, and actually features credits!  The US version just mentions a few mistranslated things, and ends.</p><p>Here's the full good ending to the Japanese version for comparison:</p><p class='img'><img

And then that folder with the rest of my games.</p><div class='title'><b>Let's begin</b></div><p>When you start up the game, you're greeted by that shifty rabbit who sold you those Street Pass games, and he rolls you through the process.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFS1Awo7eVdpm.webp" /></p><p>Ya know, now that I actually look at this photo, he ends his sentences with <span class='ja'>っす</span> for no real reason.

I guess…</p><p>After his spiel, you are presented with a couple different machines.

Those Famicom badges use that style.  For those underground Mario badges, those games use the hammer.  The hammer is something new they introduced in the past two weeks.  And it does just what you'd expect.  The hammer lowers they smacks whatever is underneath, sends badges flying, and then several of the badges fall down and are caught.</p><p>But HERE is perhaps the problem..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFSbV4E-olrs7.webp" /></p><p>In order to play this game, you must give them money.  5 plays for 90<span class='ja'>円</span> (90 cents).  You can change those options to 10 for 180<span class='ja'>円</span>, or 15 for 270<span class='ja'>円</span>, but there are no deals.  This is why I hesitated to play this game in the first place.  You can receive free plays, though.  </p><p>Every day, you have access to the practice machine one time.  You get 5 plays on the practice machine.  When you catch badges in this machine, they build towards a counter.  Every 10 catches will get you 3 free plays on the regular machines.  Every time you catch the hidden targeted badge, you get 3 free plays on the regular machines.</p><p>5 plays is a pretty good number, though.  I've been able to completely clear machines (at least with the hammer) in 3 to 6 plays.  In one case, I was able to clear a whole screen in one try.</p><div class='title'><b>Rotation</b></div><p>The contents of these UFO machines change every single day.  If you take a look at those Famicom pics again, <span class='ja'>今日で終了</span> means "ends today."  Tomorrow, there will be different badges in their place.  Those Famicom games weren't there yesterday either.  Yesterday, they introduced a bunch of Tomodachi Life items.  The day before that, they had Majora's Mask items.</p><p>From what I can tell, there have been the following series of items: Animal Crossing, Tomodachi Life, Famicom, Mario Kart 8, Zelda Majora's Mask, Zelda Link Between Words, Rhythm Heaven, 8-bit Mario, and regular Mario.  Those 8-bit Super Mario Bros sprites have a whole lot of variations.  Currently there are underground sprites, but there's been overworld ones, clouds, castle, Christmas, and some business suit ones, too.  Actually, right now they have some limited Animal Crossing badges for Hina Matsuri, which is a national holiday in Japan (March 3rd).</p><div class='title'><b>Themes</b></div><p>Additionally, if you spend at least 180<span class='ja'>円</span> in a single day, you get a free theme for your home screen.  All of these themes fit a category of badge.  I spent the money, and got that Mario underground theme, so I can closely recreate a Mario level.  These rotate, too.  Today, there was a Mario Kart 8 theme.</p><p>There are also badges which replace the standard 3DS apps (like the eShop, Street Pass, etc) so your home screen can still have a lot of functionality.  I've only been playing this game since Thursday, so I haven't gotten those yet.</p><div class='title'><b>Ornamental Goods</b></div><p>The idea of selling ornamental goods is not a new thing.  But it has never felt right.  It has always felt shady.</p><p>For the 3DS, this began last year with the sale of themes.  You would spend $1 or $2, and it would change the image and colors of things on your home screen.  There were free themes, too, but those were just solid colors.</p><p>When I originally found out about this game, I thought it was just a new level of this nonsense.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d-F5jUIAAtjlI.webp" /></p><p>This is what my screen looks like before.  Super clean, everything accessible.  My American 3DS home screen looks similar.  If I got a couple of badges in the game, where would I put them?  What would I do?  My home screen would be littered with a bunch of non-function garbage that didn't really fit at all.</p><p>Then I got this Club Nintendo theme which looked really nice.  It was 20 points through Club Nintendo. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_d_a54UsAUQMGI.webp" /></p><p>It changed the folders to Famicom carts, and made 8-bit sounds when you navigated the menu.  It was nice, and I figured those Famicom badges would actually fit with theme, and perhaps look good.</p><p>I downloaded the game, and went through the tutorial.  The first 17 or 20 minutes of this game is on Youtube, by the way.  That video shows you exactly what you're getting into.</p><p>Again, I started playing this game on Thursday.  And on Thursday, those Famicom badge weren't available in the rotation.  Bah, annoying.  I played the practice machine, and got some free plays.  With those plays, I got my first underground Mario badges.  Then, through the hammer tutorial, I got some more Mario badges.</p><p>Why not?  I dumped in 90<span class='ja'>円</span>, played again, and got a ton more badges.  Then I did it again so I could get the free theme.  And I got plenty more badges, too.  Enough to create that underground scene from earlier.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/zlCfzTFNI4AAsXxGk7.webp" /></p><p>The "free" themes are what really make the badges come alive.  Without a theme, using these particular sprites makes the home screen look like garbage.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEQc3UYAADk8Q.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEQc3UYAADk8Q.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEQc3UYAADk8Q.webp" /> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEW3QU8AAkDy4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEW3QU8AAkDy4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eEW3QU8AAkDy4.webp" /></p><p>Actually, maybe that Club Nintendo theme could work with a few changes.</p><p>I have dropped a total of 900<span class='ja'>円</span> ($9) into this game over the last 3 days.  I've captured ALL the underground sprites, and then I got all the Famicom badges which appeared today.  Ugh, I'm so dumb.</p><p>I have enough badges now to create a Mario level that extends all the way to the right, taking up the entire home screen.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eIXKkVEAAY6zb_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eIXKkVEAAY6zb_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eIXKkVEAAY6zb_stitch.webp" /></p><p>I put all my Famicom badges into the folder with the rest of my games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eMGPiU0AAmdIX.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eMGPiU0AAmdIX.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/3ds_badge/B_eMGPiU0AAmdIX.webp" /></p><p>Those hearts are from one of the Zelda Majora's Mask machines.</p><div class='title'><b>Inventory</b></div><p>Every badge you capture is just a single sprite (or a block of sprites) which takes up a single tile on the home screen.  For example, each one of those coins are an individual badge I've captured in the game.  You do not have infinite stock.  Though, apparently once you've gotten 100 of a single badge, the counter turns to a star.  Maybe then it's infinite.</p><p>To place badges on the screen, click the settings in the corner.  The badge menu shows up directly under the theme menu.  From there, you pull badges from your menu, and place them on your home screen.  Also, "opening" a badge on the home screen always brings up the badge menu.</p><div class='title'><b>Bleh</b></div><p>My home screen looks pretty awesome, but I feel like all this is taking advantage of that part in my brain that just can't say No to collecting crap.  And now, I want to get more Mario sprites and build more levels within folders.  I would LOVE to get some Zelda sprites, too, and some other 8-bit games.  Maybe some Pokemon badges...  Ugh stop!</p><p>Man, I don't like this.  It's a bunch of 3DS "hats"!</p><p>Showing off your home screen to other people is about the extent of the worth.  But that continues the cycle of making it viral.</p><p>I don't think they've made any announcement about this game coming to the US (or other territories), but the user base in Japan has surpassed 1 million unique users.  I wonder how much money they've made from this.  If each person spent $1, they've made a million dollars on practically nothing.

Goombas are Kuribo <span class='ja'>クリボー</span>.  Koopa Troopas are Nokonoko <span class='ja'>ノコノコ</span>, which is an uncommon Japanese word for unconcerned, or nonchalant.  Lakitu, which sounds Japanese, is Jugemu <span class='ja'>ジュゲム</span>.  And Toad is Kinopio <span class='ja'>キノピオ</span>.

| February 8, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I found a new hobby lately.  These toys are a pretty hot item.  Almost everywhere in the U.S., they are sold out.  Even the common ones can be tough to find.  And the uncommon and rare ones?  They sell pretty well on eBay.</p><p>In Japan, though...  they are not so scarce.  And after returning from winter vacation, I've been buying the ones difficult to find and reselling them on eBay.  An alternate title for this entry might be <b>Confessions of an Amiibo Scalper</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Amiibo</b></div><p>First, What are Amiibos?  Amiibos are these things:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are figurines of Nintendo characters created by Nintendo.  But in addition to being a figurine, each one has a chip in its based and can be used with various games on the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS.  The most prominent game being the new Super Smash Brothers title.</p><p>The first wave of these figures was released in November last year.  However, given Nintendo's risk aversion and general misunderstanding of their demographic and fan base, they did not create enough figures to match demand, and certain figures became incredibly rare quite fast, and extremely difficult to find.  Additionally, this was on the heals of Christmas, so they became quite a hot item, and demand continued to increase.</p><p>That's in the U.S., though.  In Japan, most people don't care that much about video games.  The 3DS is pretty popular, and most kids have those.  But most families do not have home consoles because they're expensive, and take over the family TV which should be shared by everyone.  Also, kids don't really care about Smash Brothers.  They're more interested in Yokai Watch and Monster Hunter.  So, Amiibos aren't selling nearly as much as the states.  Also, I think they've shipped more in Japan, than in the states (at least per capita).</p><p>Before winter vacation, I spent some time reading about all the horror stories of gamers trying to get their hands on these things.  I thought, really?  A few weeks prior I saw a full display of (maybe) all the figures at a Toys R Us.  The prices on eBay seemed to corroborate with the stories.  Some figures were selling for 3 times their MRSP.  One in particular, <i>The Villager</i>, was closer to 7 times.  Amiibo figures retail for $12.</p><p>After coming back to Japan from winter vacation, I hopped on the Amiibo bandwagon purely to resell them on eBay.</p><div class='title'><b>Waves</b></div><p>At that time, there had been 2 release waves of figures.  From the first wave, <i>The Villager</i>, <i>Marth</i>, and <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i> were the uncommon or rare figures.  Though, I think <i>Samus</i>, and <i>Fox</i> are getting hard to find now.  From the second wave, <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Pitt</i> became quickly scarce.  <i>Captain Falcon</i> is starting to get rare, too.</p><p>In Tokyo, before returning to Takayama, I went to a few Toys R Us's and other stores, and easily found plenty <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I could not find any <i>Villagers</i>, though.  Those were actually rare in Japan, too.  After returning to Takayama, I found a <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Captain Falcon</i>, plus plenty more <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I've never seen a <i>Pitt</i>, either.</p><p>In January, Nintendo released their third wave of figures.  These figures would be released in the U.S. a few weeks later.  But, in the U.S., four of these figures were retailer exclusive, meaning you couldn't figure them just anywhere.  That was not the case in Japan.  These figures were <i>Rosalina</i> exclusive to Target, <i>Lucario</i> exclusive to Toys R Us, <i>Meta Knight</i> exclusive to Best Buy, and <i>Shulk</i> exclusive to Gamestop.  These seemed like they would be the most difficult to find in the states, so when they released in Japan, I bought plenty of each.  (Shulk has yet to release in Japan, though.)</p><div class='title'><b>Buying in Rural Japan</b></div><p>In large cities, you have tons of options, but out here in the forest and the mountains, the choices are much more limited.  Takayama isn't all that bad, though.  We have a Geo <span class='ja'>ゲオ</span>, and an Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span>.  Both stores have full displays of Amiibos and received full shipments of Wave 3.  Apita <span class='ja'>アピタ</span> has 'em, too, but seemed like they only received half a shipment of Wave 3.  That rental store in Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> occasionally has some, too.</p><p>Here's the display at my local Edion, taken on Sunday.  They had plenty of the common figures, and a few of the uncommon ones.  This is in STARK contrast to any shelves in America where only <i>Peach</i> can easily be found.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This weekend, I decided to drive around the Hida <span class='ja'>飛騨</span> area and raid all the stores for their rare and uncommon Amiibo figures.  I drove south to Gero, then west to Gujo, and quickly further south to Seki.</p><div class='title'><b>Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span></b></div><p>Still within the Hida region, comprising the southern towns and villages is Gero City, with Hagiwara <span class='ja'>萩原</span>, and Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span> being its population centers.  These are about an hour away from Takayama.  In Hagiwara, there's a Yamada Denki <span class='ja'>ヤマダ電機</span> with a Techland.  And in Gero, there's another Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span> with a Neverland.  These distinctions are important.  Without a Techland, or Neverland, these stores only sell appliances.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Both stores were pretty light.  It seemed like they each only got half shipments on the figures.  The Edion in Gero was so small, but they somehow packed everything inside.  Amiibos weren't on the shelves.  I asked, and they had boxes of them in the back.  I shifted through and found another <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i>.  I bought a <i>Rosalina</i> and a <i>Meta Knight</i> from Yamada.

That's not particularly huge, but the boon is being able to convert my yen into dollars, and being able to transfer that into my back account.  This is amazing, and if I can sell enough of these things in a month, it totally mitigates my need to send money back to the U.S..</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think this is a renewable resource.  It's good for now.  I'll be able to make some cash in the short term.  But supply will continue to dwindle here in Japan.  And perhaps Nintendo will get its shit together and meet demand.  Who knows?  Best to strike while I can.</p><div class='title'><b>Lifetime Sales</b></div><p>It's been almost 7 years since I started selling things on eBay on a regular basis.  It started with a bunch of extra video games, movies, and action figures I had in my possession and no longer cared about.  I've written about this several times in the past.

I've spent the money on music and artists.  I've bought plenty of games, too.  Ultimately, it's just trading old stuff for new stuff.  Getting rid of the stuff that doesn't matter, and keeping what does.</p><p>I found my lifetime sales total on ebay the other day.  As of Sunday, February 8th, I've made nearly $10,000 reselling crap on eBay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, eBay doesn't really keep user records further back than 3 months, so there's no way to see a breakdown of this number.  I would love to see a chart of my highs and lows throughout the past decade.  At one point, I was selling so many things that I actually became a top seller. It didn't last long since my supply was never all that large.  I was only a top seller for 3 months (2 of which were the grace period at the time).</p><p>Anyway, I should easily top $10,000 by the end of the week.  Also, I'm getting pretty close to Top Seller status again thanks to Amiibo.

| January 31, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After thinking about things quite a bit, I finally decided to buy a Japanese Nintendo 3DS XL.  One of the "New" ones, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were plenty pros and cons I've dealt with for a while.  For the record, the Nintendo 3DS is a region locked system, so I'm unable to play Japanese games on my American 3DS.  Likewise, I cannot play my American games on this one.  Nor, can I really exchange data of any kind between the two handhelds on a system level.  Though, nearly all games internally don't care about exchanging data.</p><div class='title'><b>The Cons</b></div><p>I had two big reasons that kept preventing me from outright buying this for a while.  One was the lack of games.  Any 3DS game I was interested in was almost guaranteed to make it to the U.S.  So I could simply wait, and buy it later.  The second reason was the language barrier.  Even if there were a game I wanted that didn't make it to the states, it would mostly likely be story-based or have mechanics where not totally understanding the language would get in my way.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>I continued to think more and more about that second point.  Everyday I deal with problems learning Japanese, and effectively communicating with those around me.  It weighs on me most days.  When I get home, I want to relax and just turn everything off in my head.  I usually do this by playing games, and I don't want to see anymore Japanese while I'm basically trying to get away from it.  Sometimes there's just too much being shoved into my brain at once.</p><p>Other foreigners living here face similar problems.  It continually builds and builds until you NEED to get out.  You need a break, a vacation.  Going back home over Christmas really let me recharge.  The same with visiting Okinawa last year.  I guess it's technically being "Home Sick" but it's not really that I want to go back home.  I just miss the variety, or the ability to actually understand people, and be effective in society.</p><p>Anyway, I just got back from vacation, so I've been recharged.  And many of my recent clashes with Japanese have turned out somewhat successful.  I'm using Google Translate FAR LESS on webpages these days.  When talking with other teachers, I rarely need to pull out my dictionary.  And with the Japanese I'm studying, I'm able to consistently read things and only misunderstand a few vocabulary words.</p><p>I am improving and am getting better, even though I'm still terrible at it.  So, the thought of having to tackle Japanese in games, and for fun, no longer seemed like con.  Really, it was now a reason <b>for</b> buying it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Pros</b></div><p>Having another venue for studying and practicing Japanese now joined my list of pros, which was really just a list of games I wanted to play.  These games include <b>Game Center CX 3</b>, <b>Yokai Watch</b>, the <b>Picross</b> games that haven't come to the U.S., and the eventually 3rd Gen VI <b>Pokemon</b> game, whether it be Pokemon Z or Pokemon Delta Emerald.</p><p><b>Yokai Watch</b> is massive in Japan right now, and I have no idea (really) what it is.  I've read some articles about people explaining it.  I've read the wikipedia page about it.  And read a few other things, too.  From what I gather, it's a multi-media marketing machine similar to Pokemon.  Eventually, the whole thing boils down to the core video game, and a complementary anime.  Really underneath all the bullshit Pokemon has, it's a solid game, and people claim Yokai Watch is, too.</p><p>So, people think Yokai Watch is actually good, and I want to know more about it.  It is coming to the U.S. this year, but I want to learn about it now, and also attempt to do it in Japanese.</p><p>Also, another reason I wanted to buy it is that I actually want an upgraded 3DS.  I play my Nintendo 3DS a lot, and the updated hardware has a lot of great stuff.  The Circle Pad pro is built into it.  It has a faster processor.  The 3D is better.  It's a great update.</p><p>So, I bought it. :D  Here it is:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" /></a><br/><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>I took a couple photos comparing the new 3DS XL to the previous 3DS XL, plus my DSi and DS Lite, since I have those.  The 3DS game goes in the bottom now, which is kinda weird.  Same with the stylus, which I don't like, but whatever.  Additionally, you need to unscrew and remove the back faceplate to get to the SD card slot.  It's annoying, but really only needed to be done once ever.  It uses a Micro SD card now, as well.</p><p>But it feels great.  The D pad feels amazing.  The buttons feel amazing.  I haven't used the right Circle pad much yet.  There's almost no tactile feedback with that at all from what I've messed with.  In game, I'm sure it's much better.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>Also, language-wise, it has been very gratifying and confidence building how I've been able to go through menus, sign up for things, and generally understand everything that I've been doing.  The language has not once gotten in my way.</p><p>I have yet to delve into Yokai Watch, but <b>Game Center CX 3</b> is excellent so far.  And, again, I've been able to understand what has been going on in the game.  I know what the characters are talking about.  In some cases, I understand the conversations completely.  The language has not been a crutch, what-so-ever.</p><p>Though, everything is still quite within my wheel house.  I already understand the menus, and Game Center CX from using and playing the English language equivalent.  I have not done that with Yokai Watch, so that game should actually challenge my understanding of Japanese.</p><div class='title'><b>Club Nintendo Picross</b></div><p>On the digital side of things, I purchased nearly all the Picross games available on the eShop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" /></a></p><p>With my current catalogue of Japanese 3DS games I had exactly enough points to purchase Club Nintendo Picross.  Game Center CX gave me 30 points.  Yokai Watch gave me 20.  And each of the 6 Picross E games were 5 points each.  80 points exactly!</p><p>It's really odd that this game using the Picross DS "engine", rather than the upgraded Picross E.  Overall there's like 180 puzzles in the game, including 2 Mega Picross puzzles.  I wanted to make sure I was able to get this game before Club Nintendo shut down for good in the next few months.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to get Club Nintendo Picross Plus, which was a Platinum reward last year, but I'll take what I can get.</p><p>For the <b>Picross E</b> games, only the first 3 made it to the U.S.  There are 3 more that came out in Japan just this past year.  Picross e6 just came out last month.  In addition, there's a second Picross Gameboy Virtual Console game only in Japan.  Whee, Picross!</p><div class='title'><b>Plenty to do</b></div><p>Well now I have plenty of new games to play, and also can actually take part in more Japanese games.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-end-2014-additions">Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 3, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Another year comes to close, and it has been another lucrative year for the team at Cards Against Humanity.  They've released quite a bit of new content.  At <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">PAX East</a>, they released a few new booster packs.  At PAX Prime, they released their fifth expansion.  And with Christmas passed, their new holiday expansion is now complete, too.</p><p>I'm back in the states for Christmas, and I'm able to catch up with the recent (and one not-so-recent) expansions of the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Reject Pack</b></div><p>The Reject Pack is an illusive booster pack of cards featuring some of the cut ideas for the original release of the game.  Not too long after the original release of the game, they began giving these out at various events, and giving them out as they fixed printing mistakes in their games.  They've never officially sold them, or even acknowledged their existence.</p><p>As I mentioned in that PAX East post, some company on amazon listed Reject Packs for $10.  Whether they were bootleg or not, that is absolutely the cheapest I have ever seen them offered online.  I quickly bought one, and this is the result:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The cards look pretty damn good.  The card titles match what has been posted online.  I can't really say if the portraits and the reject icon are correct, but they're close enough for me.  </p><p>The card quality seems slightly cheaper than the cards offered in the fifth expansion, but the cards have the correct pressing texture.  Perhaps the quality is slightly lower because these were printed alongside the first versions of the game before the company was highly profitable?</p><p>I can't really say whether these are fake one way or the other.  They didn't come from CAH official, but there are no obvious flaws.  For me, though, they are certainly good enough to cross off my check-list. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Official Fifth Expansion & Crabs Fourth Expansion</b></div><p>More and more cards.  During PAX Prime, they officially released their fifth expansion.  A month later, Crabs released their fourth expansion.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between these two expansions, you can observe the gap of humor between the official card writers at CAH, and the Crabs writers.  SO many of the Crabs cards are specific references.  Those kind of references you might find in an episode of Family Guy.  As if those kind of references are jokes in of themselves.  "Ze Germans"?  Oh yeah, I remember that from Snatch.  "www.clownpenis.fart"?  A reference to a hilarious SNL sketch, but not funny on its own.  The very last card in the expansion is a reference to Robin William's death..  </p><p>Many of the CAH cards don't really go into specifics.  They allow the audience and the players to make those connections on their own.  Really, that's the core of the humor in Cards Against Humanity.  These Crabs cards really miss the point.  They've really always missed the point.</p><div class='title'><b>10 Days (or whatever) of Kwanza</b></div><p>They did another holiday promotion in which CAH sent out several daily letters containing various things.  Each envelope detailed the story of Santa's death, and the great lizard uprising of 2352.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This year, there were a total of 11 envelopes.  The final present last year was a single white card with the recipients name on it.  This year, they got the individual cards out of the way immediately on the first day.  There was one white card, and one black card.  The second day contained magnetic stickers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The third, fourth, and fifth days contained the official 2014 holiday cards.  The themes for each set of cards were Past, Present and Future.  Between all the sets there are 30 cards.  6 black cards, and 24 white ones.</p><p>The six, seventh, and eighth days included a bunch of fun stuff: taste changing tablets, an indie card game, and web comics in print form.  </p><p>The ninth, tenth, and eleventh days were more political and satire.  The ninth day listed all the campaign contributors to some nefarious congressman from the midterm elections.  The tenth day announced their purchased of a private island, and a deed for one square foot of land on the island.  And the eleventh day was a small book of email responses.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Fun stuff.  <i>Edit:</i> The days are incorrect, but whatever.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Released Expansions</b></div><p>By the end of 2014, the following add-ons have been released for Cards Against Humanity, and are available for purchase on the CAH website.</p><p>- First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth (Official) Expansions<br/>- Christmas 2012, and Christmas 2013 (12 Days of Holiday Bullshit) Packs<br/>- The 90s Nostalgia Pack<br/>- The Bigger, Blacker Box (which includes the Box Expansion)</p><p>The following are unofficial expansions available for purchase on their respective websites:</p><p>- Crabs Adjust Humidity Volumes One, Two, Three, and Four (Unofficial)<br/>- Cards & Punishment Volume One* (Unofficial)</p><p>And the following have been released in limited quantities at various events.</p><p>- Christmas 2014 Pack (Tens Days (or Whatever) of Kwanza)<br/>- PAX East 2013, and PAX Prime 2013 Promo Packs<br/>- PWNMeal (PAX East 2014) Promo Packs<br/>- PAX East 2014, and PAX Prime 2014 Panel Packs*<br/>- The Reject Pack<br/>- The House of Cards Against Humanity Pack*<br/>- The Science Pack*<br/>- The TableTop Pack*</p><p>And, again, I have all of the above except for the ones marked with an asterisk*.  I mentioned some of those in the previous <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">post</a>, but I'll reiterate.</p><p><b>PAX Panel Packs</b> are 2 sets of 10 cards offered only to attendees of the panels at PAX East 2014 and PAX Prime 2014.  During the panel, audience members offer suggestions for cards and the best 10 cards are printed overnight, and given the audience members the next day.</p><p><b>House of Cards Against Humanity Pack</b> was a promotional item offered by Netflix for the release of House of Cards season two, which happened in February 2014.  Netflix asked CAH to make some cards, and they created 25 cards: 9 black, 16 white.  100,000 of these packs were offered for free online, and sold out within 45 minutes after Netflix tweeted about it.</p><p><b>The Science Pack</b> is another promotional item put together by CAH for the Bay Area Science Festival.  They have mentioned this will be offered online sometime in 2015.  There are 18 cards: 6 black, 12 white.</p><p><b>The TableTop Pack</b> is a promotion for the indie web show Table Top, starring Wil Wheaton, apparently.  To fund season three they setup something on IndieGoGo, and CAH offered a pack of cards for the $20 mark.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>In addition to the above expansions, I also bought a second bigger, blacker box to house my growing collection.  As mentioned before, several cards in the original sets were designed to work well with each other, but with so many expansions and unofficial expansions, those connections are lost and diluted.  There are a lot of great cards added in the expansions, but I think there are more useless ones.  I need to pair down my collection and make a great solid set of cards.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's my current collection.  For now, I separated all the cards into 3 different stacks: original cards, official expansion cards, and the unofficial expansion cards.  I think that's the best way for quality control for the time being.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokedex Nearly Complete!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokedex-nearly-complete">Pokedex Nearly Complete!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 21, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After taking a break for a few weeks, I completed Pokemon Omega Ruby today.  There's still the Delta Episode to complete, plus several legendaries to scoop up, though.</p><p>Omega Ruby is pretty damn good.  They've cleaned up a lot of rough edges from Pokemon X, and there's a ton of end game, and side content.  WAY more than Pokemon X/Y.  I think the only shame is not continuing the character customization from Pokemon X, but that's fine.</p><p>Right now, my Pokedex for Pokemon X is at 718*, and Omega Ruby is at 716 out of a (current) possible 719.  I need an Aromatisse, and Yveltal for Omega Ruby, and a Meloetta for both games.  I'm so close to completing the Pokedex, a challenge that I began 10 years ago with Pokemon Emerald.  It's somewhat fitting that I'm so close to completing that goal with the remake.</p><p>Also, between Pokemon White, Pokemon X, and Omega Ruby, I have several EV trained and move balanced Pokemon, that I could probably make a decent and competitive league team.  So I might start doing that next year.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokedex Completion History</b></div><p>Nearly 10 years ago, I picked up Pokemon Emerald and played it quite a bit with my girlfriend at the time.  We started doing this around the time Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green were released, so after we completed Emerald, I bought Fire Red, and she bought Leaf Green.  We ran through both games, and given our position, I suggested we could probably complete the Pokedex between the both of us.</p><p>We got close before giving up.  At the time, there were a possible 386 pokemon.  I think my Emerald pokedex was around 340, or 360, maybe?  For event pokemon, we had a Jirachi, but did not have Mew, Celebi, or Deoxys.</p><p>Then next time I really played Pokemon was when I studied abroad and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were released in Fall 2006.  Later, back in the states, I bought Pokemon Platinum on its release, and went all the way through that game.  Throughout this time, I was collecting each event Pokemon upon its availability.  Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out.  I started going through Soul Silver, but got bored.</p><p>When Pokemon White and Black were released, I actually had a friend who played and cared about the games, too.  I played through White and she played through Black.  We both caught all the exclusive Pokemon and traded them back and forth to complete our Pokedexes.</p><p>At this point, my dream to complete the Pokedex was rekindled.  Starting with Generation III (ruby / sapphire / emerald / leaf green / fire red), you could migrate your Pokemon to the next generation.  So all my Pokemon from Emerald could be moved to Platinum, and from Platinum to Pokemon White.  With my hefty amount of Pokemon from Emerald, and complete saves on Platinum and White, I was able to fill out the new rosters, and get closer.</p><p>I bought some of the older copies of the games to fill out the starters I was missing.  And I even bought a new Nintendo DS, so I could trade and transfer Pokemon between the Gen IV and Gen V games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" /></p><p>This was about 4 years ago.  After the release of Black and White 2, my Pokedex on Pokemon White was at 647 out of 649.  I was missing at Latios, which was available to capture in Pokemon Soul Silver, but I just got so bored playing that game.  And I was missing Meloetta, which was an event Pokemon not yet released.  Almost complete!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, Meloetta was released after I starting living in Japan, so I had no way of getting it.  Maybe I had a chance while in Japan, but I missed that opportunity.</p><p>Pokemon X and Y came out last year, bumping the total amount of Pokemon to 718, with an additional 3 event Pokemon yet to be released, announced, or even available in the Pokedex.  Pokemon X was rather boring, though.  There were very few new Pokemon, and the controls were somewhat rocky especially after playing Zelda.  I captured all the Pokemon, though, and during Christmas break, traded back and forth to complete the new set.</p><p>At the time, there was also no built-in way to transfer Gen IV Pokemon to the new games.  Later, an app was released, Pokemon Bank, that allowed you to do this.  I got bored with Pokemon X, so I left it.</p><p>But, ramping up to the release of Omega Ruby, and the release of Diancie, the 719th Pokemon, I started getting into Pokemon again.  I migrated all my Pokemon forward, and filled in any holes I was missing in my Pokedex.  I was now at 717, with only Meloetta and Latios missing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" /></p><p>Playing through Omega Ruby, they basically just give you Latios for free.  You don't even need to battle and catch it.  It felt somewhat empty to have finally catch this Pokemon without even a fight, but whatever.  *My Pokemon X Dex is still at 717, though, because I'm too lazy too transfer it.</p><p>I transferred all my Pokemon over to Omega Ruby, but I do not actually have a living "copy" of Aromatisse and Yveltal (from Pokemon X/Y), so my Omega Ruby Dex is at 716.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing the journey from 10 years ago to 4 years ago to today, these are the games and handhelds I have with me in Japan.  There are still some Pokemon left to capture and transfer from Soul Silver, so I might start playing that again.  My save is just after catching Lugia, and before Victory Road.</p><p>Anyway, <b>I'm so close!</b>  I'm only missing 3 pokemon, and the additional 2 yet unreleased event pokemon.  (Though, #720 Hoppa might be soon.)</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing</b></div><p>After playing the shit out of Pokemon White, I became more interested in some of the meta-game aspects of raising and breeding pokemon.  I designed, and started training a balanced EV trained team.  I completely trained 3 pokemon out of the 6 I had planned before I got bored, and gave up.</p><p>I started playing Pokemon X again right before Omega Ruby's release, and EV trained some more pokemon.  EV training is SO easy in Gen VI.  I am so thankful for that.  I completely trained 2 pokemon in that game.</p><p>And with Omega Ruby, I bred and EV trained 4 pokemon in Pokemon X, transferred them to Omega Ruby, and played through all of the game with them.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, with these pokemon, I think I'll make a team, and start competing online.  Why not, right?  With my sole goal of pokemon (finishing the Pokedex) basically complete, I should start getting into the aspect of pokemon that has really kept the franchise alive: battling and competing.</p><p>We'll see, though, maybe I'll lose a lot, get bored, and give up.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next?</b></div><p>I'm super interested to see what they have planned next.  With the addition of Mega evolutions, I think they've pretty much run out of ideas to keep Pokemon fresh.  Pokemon releases are now almost a yearly occurrence.</p><p>2007 = Pokemon Diamond + Pearl<br/>2009 = Pokemon Platinum<br/>2010 = Pokemon Heart Gold + Soul Silver<br/>2011 = Pokemon Black + White<br/>2012 = Pokemon Black + White 2<br/>2013 = Pokemon X + Y<br/>2014 = Pokemon Omega Ruby + Alpha Sapphire</p><p>I could totally see a Pokemon Z (or whatever) coming out in 2015, too.  Maybe that game would bring over all the engine fixes in Omega Ruby, and also correctly bridge the two games.  And perhaps have a lot of good end game content, too.</p><p>But, they really need to take a break.  Pokemon needs some breathing room.</p><p>Anyway, that's my story.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Video Game shopping in Toyama 富山市" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-shopping-in-toyama">Video Game shopping in Toyama 富山市</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 6, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When shopping for video games in Japan, I think a lot of people think about going to Akihabara in Tokyo, or perhaps Den Den Town in Osaka, or one of the other popularized meccas of video game and anime nerdom.  But, if you've ever gone to any popularized retro gaming place in the U.S., their selection is great, but their prices typically are not.  Much like the U.S., there are tons of used stores throughout the country, and they usually yield better scores.</p><p>I currently live in Takayama in Gifu, and while the gaming stores are pathetic in my city, Toyama <span class='ja'>富山市</span>, an hour and a half to the north, has quite a few, for some reason.  Gifu City <span class='ja'>岐阜市</span>, Kanazawa <span class='ja'>金沢市</span>, Matsumoto <span class='ja'>松本市</span>, and Nagoya <span class='ja'>名古屋</span> are within the same distance and time frame (in different directions), but they don't have nearly the cache Toyama does.  I don't know why.</p><p>I hadn't been on a video game shopping trip in quite a while, and my brother-in-law recently decided to repair and mod his Super Nintendo for import games.  He asked me to search for some games, along with the list of Famicom games I've been working on.</p><p>I'm not completely familiar with the Super Famicom library, but whatever. Let's go!</p><div class='title'><b>Shuttle <span class='ja'>シャトル</span> in Tonami <span class='ja'>砺波</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" /></p><p>I left my house around 8:30am, and went directly the first place on my list.  This was my first time going to Shuttle.  To find used game stores using Google Maps, I usually search for <span class='ja'>ファミコン</span>, and that pulls up stores that carry Famicom games.  Chances are if they carry those games, they carry all games.  Shuttle is the only thing that came up for Toyama, for some reason.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp"/></a></p><p>And Shuttle did not disappoint.  It's a massive nerd store with games, figures, porn, books, manga, fishing equipment, guns, cards, and some other stuff.  I started sifting through the Super Famicom games.

Nintendo 3DS, DS, and Playstation 3 tend to dominate the shelves.  PSP and Playstation 2 still have decent sized sections, though.  Vita is tiny.

They had a few Playstation 4 games.</p><p>I peered through the 3DS games, and a game called <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8391.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8391.webp">J Legend Series <span class='ja'>列伝</span></a> caught my eye.

Again, I'm not completely familiar with the Super Famicom library.

I had been to some of these places before, so I already had an idea of what they had, and how long to spend inside.  These stores aren't that much different than what you'd find in any mid-level city.  Though, Toyama seems to have a few more stores than other nearby cities.</p><p>Towards the end of the day, I was skipping over some stores on my list.  There is another Hard Off near the Manga Warehouse, but I was mostly cached for the day.  I'm sure there are plenty of other hidden gems in Toyama, too.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/8">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/6">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
