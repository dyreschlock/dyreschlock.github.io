It seems that Mario is pretty common, and easy to find.  I don't know if they've intentionally made any characters rare, but the sticker on the case shows which character is inside, so they aren't randomized, or anything.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150306_mario/IMG_4555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150306_mario/IMG_4555.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150306_mario/IMG_4555_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150306_mario/IMG_4555_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150306_mario/IMG_4555_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By the way, if you're interested, some of the character names in Super Mario are different in Japan.  Mario, Luigi, and Peach are the same: <span class='ja'>マリオ</span>, <span class='ja'>ルイージ</span>, <span class='ja'>ピーチ</span>.  </p><p>But, Bowser has always been simply referred to as Koopa <span class='ja'>クッパ</span>.  Goombas are Kuribo <span class='ja'>クリボー</span>.  Koopa Troopas are Nokonoko <span class='ja'>ノコノコ</span>, which is an uncommon Japanese word for unconcerned, or nonchalant.  Lakitu, which sounds Japanese, is Jugemu <span class='ja'>ジュゲム</span>.  And Toad is Kinopio <span class='ja'>キノピオ</span>.  Kinoko <span class='ja'>キノコ</span> is Japanese for mushroom, so that fits. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Buying Amiibos and Selling them on eBay" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/buying-amiibos-in-japan-and-selling-them-on-ebay">Buying Amiibos and Selling them on eBay</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 8, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I found a new hobby lately.  These toys are a pretty hot item.  Almost everywhere in the U.S., they are sold out.  Even the common ones can be tough to find.  And the uncommon and rare ones?  They sell pretty well on eBay.</p><p>In Japan, though...  they are not so scarce.  And after returning from winter vacation, I've been buying the ones difficult to find and reselling them on eBay.  An alternate title for this entry might be <b>Confessions of an Amiibo Scalper</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Amiibo</b></div><p>First, What are Amiibos?  Amiibos are these things:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1450_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are figurines of Nintendo characters created by Nintendo.  But in addition to being a figurine, each one has a chip in its based and can be used with various games on the Nintendo Wii U and 3DS.  The most prominent game being the new Super Smash Brothers title.</p><p>The first wave of these figures was released in November last year.  However, given Nintendo's risk aversion and general misunderstanding of their demographic and fan base, they did not create enough figures to match demand, and certain figures became incredibly rare quite fast, and extremely difficult to find.  Additionally, this was on the heals of Christmas, so they became quite a hot item, and demand continued to increase.</p><p>That's in the U.S., though.  In Japan, most people don't care that much about video games.  The 3DS is pretty popular, and most kids have those.  But most families do not have home consoles because they're expensive, and take over the family TV which should be shared by everyone.  Also, kids don't really care about Smash Brothers.  They're more interested in Yokai Watch and Monster Hunter.  So, Amiibos aren't selling nearly as much as the states.  Also, I think they've shipped more in Japan, than in the states (at least per capita).</p><p>Before winter vacation, I spent some time reading about all the horror stories of gamers trying to get their hands on these things.  I thought, really?  A few weeks prior I saw a full display of (maybe) all the figures at a Toys R Us.  The prices on eBay seemed to corroborate with the stories.  Some figures were selling for 3 times their MRSP.  One in particular, <i>The Villager</i>, was closer to 7 times.  Amiibo figures retail for $12.</p><p>After coming back to Japan from winter vacation, I hopped on the Amiibo bandwagon purely to resell them on eBay.</p><div class='title'><b>Waves</b></div><p>At that time, there had been 2 release waves of figures.  From the first wave, <i>The Villager</i>, <i>Marth</i>, and <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i> were the uncommon or rare figures.  Though, I think <i>Samus</i>, and <i>Fox</i> are getting hard to find now.  From the second wave, <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Pitt</i> became quickly scarce.  <i>Captain Falcon</i> is starting to get rare, too.</p><p>In Tokyo, before returning to Takayama, I went to a few Toys R Us's and other stores, and easily found plenty <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I could not find any <i>Villagers</i>, though.  Those were actually rare in Japan, too.  After returning to Takayama, I found a <i>Little Mac</i>, and <i>Captain Falcon</i>, plus plenty more <i>Marth</i> and <i>Wii Fit Trainers</i>.  I've never seen a <i>Pitt</i>, either.</p><p>In January, Nintendo released their third wave of figures.  These figures would be released in the U.S. a few weeks later.  But, in the U.S., four of these figures were retailer exclusive, meaning you couldn't figure them just anywhere.  That was not the case in Japan.  These figures were <i>Rosalina</i> exclusive to Target, <i>Lucario</i> exclusive to Toys R Us, <i>Meta Knight</i> exclusive to Best Buy, and <i>Shulk</i> exclusive to Gamestop.  These seemed like they would be the most difficult to find in the states, so when they released in Japan, I bought plenty of each.  (Shulk has yet to release in Japan, though.)</p><div class='title'><b>Buying in Rural Japan</b></div><p>In large cities, you have tons of options, but out here in the forest and the mountains, the choices are much more limited.  Takayama isn't all that bad, though.  We have a Geo <span class='ja'>ゲオ</span>, and an Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span>.  Both stores have full displays of Amiibos and received full shipments of Wave 3.  Apita <span class='ja'>アピタ</span> has 'em, too, but seemed like they only received half a shipment of Wave 3.  That rental store in Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> occasionally has some, too.</p><p>Here's the display at my local Edion, taken on Sunday.  They had plenty of the common figures, and a few of the uncommon ones.  This is in STARK contrast to any shelves in America where only <i>Peach</i> can easily be found.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1445_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This weekend, I decided to drive around the Hida <span class='ja'>飛騨</span> area and raid all the stores for their rare and uncommon Amiibo figures.  I drove south to Gero, then west to Gujo, and quickly further south to Seki.</p><div class='title'><b>Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span></b></div><p>Still within the Hida region, comprising the southern towns and villages is Gero City, with Hagiwara <span class='ja'>萩原</span>, and Gero <span class='ja'>下呂</span> being its population centers.  These are about an hour away from Takayama.  In Hagiwara, there's a Yamada Denki <span class='ja'>ヤマダ電機</span> with a Techland.  And in Gero, there's another Edion <span class='ja'>エディオン</span> with a Neverland.  These distinctions are important.  Without a Techland, or Neverland, these stores only sell appliances.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1423_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1137_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1426_t.webp" /></a><br /><br /><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/IMG_1425_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Both stores were pretty light.  It seemed like they each only got half shipments on the figures.  The Edion in Gero was so small, but they somehow packed everything inside.  Amiibos weren't on the shelves.  I asked, and they had boxes of them in the back.  I shifted through and found another <i>Wii Fit Trainer</i>.  I bought a <i>Rosalina</i> and a <i>Meta Knight</i> from Yamada.  Its <i>Lucario</i> was damaged.</p><div class='title'><b>Gujo <span class='ja'>郡上</span></b></div><p>Gujo is directly west of Gero.  There is a road that connects the two cities, but it has not been reworked for the modern age.  Some construction has begun, but it is decades away from being a fast, convenient route.  So, there's plenty of mountains to climb and descend with plenty of winding icey roads to guide you through the deep fog.

That's not particularly huge, but the boon is being able to convert my yen into dollars, and being able to transfer that into my back account.  This is amazing, and if I can sell enough of these things in a month, it totally mitigates my need to send money back to the U.S..</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think this is a renewable resource.  It's good for now.  I'll be able to make some cash in the short term.  But supply will continue to dwindle here in Japan.  And perhaps Nintendo will get its shit together and meet demand.  Who knows?  Best to strike while I can.</p><div class='title'><b>Lifetime Sales</b></div><p>It's been almost 7 years since I started selling things on eBay on a regular basis.  It started with a bunch of extra video games, movies, and action figures I had in my possession and no longer cared about.  I've written about this several times in the past.

I've spent the money on music and artists.  I've bought plenty of games, too.  Ultimately, it's just trading old stuff for new stuff.  Getting rid of the stuff that doesn't matter, and keeping what does.</p><p>I found my lifetime sales total on ebay the other day.  As of Sunday, February 8th, I've made nearly $10,000 reselling crap on eBay.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150208_amiibo/ebay-sales.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, eBay doesn't really keep user records further back than 3 months, so there's no way to see a breakdown of this number.  I would love to see a chart of my highs and lows throughout the past decade.  At one point, I was selling so many things that I actually became a top seller. It didn't last long since my supply was never all that large.  I was only a top seller for 3 months (2 of which were the grace period at the time).</p><p>Anyway, I should easily top $10,000 by the end of the week.  Also, I'm getting pretty close to Top Seller status again thanks to Amiibo.

| January 31, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After thinking about things quite a bit, I finally decided to buy a Japanese Nintendo 3DS XL.  One of the "New" ones, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1250_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were plenty pros and cons I've dealt with for a while.  For the record, the Nintendo 3DS is a region locked system, so I'm unable to play Japanese games on my American 3DS.  Likewise, I cannot play my American games on this one.  Nor, can I really exchange data of any kind between the two handhelds on a system level.  Though, nearly all games internally don't care about exchanging data.</p><div class='title'><b>The Cons</b></div><p>I had two big reasons that kept preventing me from outright buying this for a while.  One was the lack of games.  Any 3DS game I was interested in was almost guaranteed to make it to the U.S.  So I could simply wait, and buy it later.  The second reason was the language barrier.  Even if there were a game I wanted that didn't make it to the states, it would mostly likely be story-based or have mechanics where not totally understanding the language would get in my way.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>I continued to think more and more about that second point.  Everyday I deal with problems learning Japanese, and effectively communicating with those around me.  It weighs on me most days.  When I get home, I want to relax and just turn everything off in my head.  I usually do this by playing games, and I don't want to see anymore Japanese while I'm basically trying to get away from it.  Sometimes there's just too much being shoved into my brain at once.</p><p>Other foreigners living here face similar problems.  It continually builds and builds until you NEED to get out.  You need a break, a vacation.  Going back home over Christmas really let me recharge.  The same with visiting Okinawa last year.  I guess it's technically being "Home Sick" but it's not really that I want to go back home.  I just miss the variety, or the ability to actually understand people, and be effective in society.</p><p>Anyway, I just got back from vacation, so I've been recharged.  And many of my recent clashes with Japanese have turned out somewhat successful.  I'm using Google Translate FAR LESS on webpages these days.  When talking with other teachers, I rarely need to pull out my dictionary.  And with the Japanese I'm studying, I'm able to consistently read things and only misunderstand a few vocabulary words.</p><p>I am improving and am getting better, even though I'm still terrible at it.  So, the thought of having to tackle Japanese in games, and for fun, no longer seemed like con.  Really, it was now a reason <b>for</b> buying it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Pros</b></div><p>Having another venue for studying and practicing Japanese now joined my list of pros, which was really just a list of games I wanted to play.  These games include <b>Game Center CX 3</b>, <b>Yokai Watch</b>, the <b>Picross</b> games that haven't come to the U.S., and the eventually 3rd Gen VI <b>Pokemon</b> game, whether it be Pokemon Z or Pokemon Delta Emerald.</p><p><b>Yokai Watch</b> is massive in Japan right now, and I have no idea (really) what it is.  I've read some articles about people explaining it.  I've read the wikipedia page about it.  And read a few other things, too.  From what I gather, it's a multi-media marketing machine similar to Pokemon.  Eventually, the whole thing boils down to the core video game, and a complementary anime.  Really underneath all the bullshit Pokemon has, it's a solid game, and people claim Yokai Watch is, too.</p><p>So, people think Yokai Watch is actually good, and I want to know more about it.  It is coming to the U.S. this year, but I want to learn about it now, and also attempt to do it in Japanese.</p><p>Also, another reason I wanted to buy it is that I actually want an upgraded 3DS.  I play my Nintendo 3DS a lot, and the updated hardware has a lot of great stuff.  The Circle Pad pro is built into it.  It has a faster processor.  The 3D is better.  It's a great update.</p><p>So, I bought it. :D  Here it is:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1298_t.webp" /></a><br/><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1314.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1336.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>I took a couple photos comparing the new 3DS XL to the previous 3DS XL, plus my DSi and DS Lite, since I have those.  The 3DS game goes in the bottom now, which is kinda weird.  Same with the stylus, which I don't like, but whatever.  Additionally, you need to unscrew and remove the back faceplate to get to the SD card slot.  It's annoying, but really only needed to be done once ever.  It uses a Micro SD card now, as well.</p><p>But it feels great.  The D pad feels amazing.  The buttons feel amazing.  I haven't used the right Circle pad much yet.  There's almost no tactile feedback with that at all from what I've messed with.  In game, I'm sure it's much better.</p><div class='title'><b>Language Barrier</b></div><p>Also, language-wise, it has been very gratifying and confidence building how I've been able to go through menus, sign up for things, and generally understand everything that I've been doing.  The language has not once gotten in my way.</p><p>I have yet to delve into Yokai Watch, but <b>Game Center CX 3</b> is excellent so far.  And, again, I've been able to understand what has been going on in the game.  I know what the characters are talking about.  In some cases, I understand the conversations completely.  The language has not been a crutch, what-so-ever.</p><p>Though, everything is still quite within my wheel house.  I already understand the menus, and Game Center CX from using and playing the English language equivalent.  I have not done that with Yokai Watch, so that game should actually challenge my understanding of Japanese.</p><div class='title'><b>Club Nintendo Picross</b></div><p>On the digital side of things, I purchased nearly all the Picross games available on the eShop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150131_3ds/IMG_1363.webp" /></a></p><p>With my current catalogue of Japanese 3DS games I had exactly enough points to purchase Club Nintendo Picross.  Game Center CX gave me 30 points.  Yokai Watch gave me 20.  And each of the 6 Picross E games were 5 points each.  80 points exactly!</p><p>It's really odd that this game using the Picross DS "engine", rather than the upgraded Picross E.  Overall there's like 180 puzzles in the game, including 2 Mega Picross puzzles.  I wanted to make sure I was able to get this game before Club Nintendo shut down for good in the next few months.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to get Club Nintendo Picross Plus, which was a Platinum reward last year, but I'll take what I can get.</p><p>For the <b>Picross E</b> games, only the first 3 made it to the U.S.  There are 3 more that came out in Japan just this past year.  Picross e6 just came out last month.  In addition, there's a second Picross Gameboy Virtual Console game only in Japan.  Whee, Picross!</p><div class='title'><b>Plenty to do</b></div><p>Well now I have plenty of new games to play, and also can actually take part in more Japanese games.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-end-2014-additions">Cards Against Humanity End 2014 Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 3, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Another year comes to close, and it has been another lucrative year for the team at Cards Against Humanity.  They've released quite a bit of new content.  At <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">PAX East</a>, they released a few new booster packs.  At PAX Prime, they released their fifth expansion.  And with Christmas passed, their new holiday expansion is now complete, too.</p><p>I'm back in the states for Christmas, and I'm able to catch up with the recent (and one not-so-recent) expansions of the game.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0408_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Reject Pack</b></div><p>The Reject Pack is an illusive booster pack of cards featuring some of the cut ideas for the original release of the game.  Not too long after the original release of the game, they began giving these out at various events, and giving them out as they fixed printing mistakes in their games.  They've never officially sold them, or even acknowledged their existence.</p><p>As I mentioned in that PAX East post, some company on amazon listed Reject Packs for $10.  Whether they were bootleg or not, that is absolutely the cheapest I have ever seen them offered online.  I quickly bought one, and this is the result:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0416_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The cards look pretty damn good.  The card titles match what has been posted online.  I can't really say if the portraits and the reject icon are correct, but they're close enough for me.  </p><p>The card quality seems slightly cheaper than the cards offered in the fifth expansion, but the cards have the correct pressing texture.  Perhaps the quality is slightly lower because these were printed alongside the first versions of the game before the company was highly profitable?</p><p>I can't really say whether these are fake one way or the other.  They didn't come from CAH official, but there are no obvious flaws.  For me, though, they are certainly good enough to cross off my check-list. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Official Fifth Expansion & Crabs Fourth Expansion</b></div><p>More and more cards.  During PAX Prime, they officially released their fifth expansion.  A month later, Crabs released their fourth expansion.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0424_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0429_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between these two expansions, you can observe the gap of humor between the official card writers at CAH, and the Crabs writers.  SO many of the Crabs cards are specific references.  Those kind of references you might find in an episode of Family Guy.  As if those kind of references are jokes in of themselves.  "Ze Germans"?  Oh yeah, I remember that from Snatch.  "www.clownpenis.fart"?  A reference to a hilarious SNL sketch, but not funny on its own.  The very last card in the expansion is a reference to Robin William's death..  </p><p>Many of the CAH cards don't really go into specifics.  They allow the audience and the players to make those connections on their own.  Really, that's the core of the humor in Cards Against Humanity.  These Crabs cards really miss the point.  They've really always missed the point.</p><div class='title'><b>10 Days (or whatever) of Kwanza</b></div><p>They did another holiday promotion in which CAH sent out several daily letters containing various things.  Each envelope detailed the story of Santa's death, and the great lizard uprising of 2352.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0440_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This year, there were a total of 11 envelopes.  The final present last year was a single white card with the recipients name on it.  This year, they got the individual cards out of the way immediately on the first day.  There was one white card, and one black card.  The second day contained magnetic stickers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0443_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0451_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The third, fourth, and fifth days contained the official 2014 holiday cards.  The themes for each set of cards were Past, Present and Future.  Between all the sets there are 30 cards.  6 black cards, and 24 white ones.</p><p>The six, seventh, and eighth days included a bunch of fun stuff: taste changing tablets, an indie card game, and web comics in print form.  </p><p>The ninth, tenth, and eleventh days were more political and satire.  The ninth day listed all the campaign contributors to some nefarious congressman from the midterm elections.  The tenth day announced their purchased of a private island, and a deed for one square foot of land on the island.  And the eleventh day was a small book of email responses.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0457_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0465_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Fun stuff.  <i>Edit:</i> The days are incorrect, but whatever.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Released Expansions</b></div><p>By the end of 2014, the following add-ons have been released for Cards Against Humanity, and are available for purchase on the CAH website.</p><p>- First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth (Official) Expansions<br/>- Christmas 2012, and Christmas 2013 (12 Days of Holiday Bullshit) Packs<br/>- The 90s Nostalgia Pack<br/>- The Bigger, Blacker Box (which includes the Box Expansion)</p><p>The following are unofficial expansions available for purchase on their respective websites:</p><p>- Crabs Adjust Humidity Volumes One, Two, Three, and Four (Unofficial)<br/>- Cards & Punishment Volume One* (Unofficial)</p><p>And the following have been released in limited quantities at various events.</p><p>- Christmas 2014 Pack (Tens Days (or Whatever) of Kwanza)<br/>- PAX East 2013, and PAX Prime 2013 Promo Packs<br/>- PWNMeal (PAX East 2014) Promo Packs<br/>- PAX East 2014, and PAX Prime 2014 Panel Packs*<br/>- The Reject Pack<br/>- The House of Cards Against Humanity Pack*<br/>- The Science Pack*<br/>- The TableTop Pack*</p><p>And, again, I have all of the above except for the ones marked with an asterisk*.  I mentioned some of those in the previous <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions" title="/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">post</a>, but I'll reiterate.</p><p><b>PAX Panel Packs</b> are 2 sets of 10 cards offered only to attendees of the panels at PAX East 2014 and PAX Prime 2014.  During the panel, audience members offer suggestions for cards and the best 10 cards are printed overnight, and given the audience members the next day.</p><p><b>House of Cards Against Humanity Pack</b> was a promotional item offered by Netflix for the release of House of Cards season two, which happened in February 2014.  Netflix asked CAH to make some cards, and they created 25 cards: 9 black, 16 white.  100,000 of these packs were offered for free online, and sold out within 45 minutes after Netflix tweeted about it.</p><p><b>The Science Pack</b> is another promotional item put together by CAH for the Bay Area Science Festival.  They have mentioned this will be offered online sometime in 2015.  There are 18 cards: 6 black, 12 white.</p><p><b>The TableTop Pack</b> is a promotion for the indie web show Table Top, starring Wil Wheaton, apparently.  To fund season three they setup something on IndieGoGo, and CAH offered a pack of cards for the $20 mark.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>In addition to the above expansions, I also bought a second bigger, blacker box to house my growing collection.  As mentioned before, several cards in the original sets were designed to work well with each other, but with so many expansions and unofficial expansions, those connections are lost and diluted.  There are a lot of great cards added in the expansions, but I think there are more useless ones.  I need to pair down my collection and make a great solid set of cards.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150103_cards/IMG_0603_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's my current collection.  For now, I separated all the cards into 3 different stacks: original cards, official expansion cards, and the unofficial expansion cards.  I think that's the best way for quality control for the time being.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokedex Nearly Complete!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokedex-nearly-complete">Pokedex Nearly Complete!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 21, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After taking a break for a few weeks, I completed Pokemon Omega Ruby today.  There's still the Delta Episode to complete, plus several legendaries to scoop up, though.</p><p>Omega Ruby is pretty damn good.  They've cleaned up a lot of rough edges from Pokemon X, and there's a ton of end game, and side content.  WAY more than Pokemon X/Y.  I think the only shame is not continuing the character customization from Pokemon X, but that's fine.</p><p>Right now, my Pokedex for Pokemon X is at 718*, and Omega Ruby is at 716 out of a (current) possible 719.  I need an Aromatisse, and Yveltal for Omega Ruby, and a Meloetta for both games.  I'm so close to completing the Pokedex, a challenge that I began 10 years ago with Pokemon Emerald.  It's somewhat fitting that I'm so close to completing that goal with the remake.</p><p>Also, between Pokemon White, Pokemon X, and Omega Ruby, I have several EV trained and move balanced Pokemon, that I could probably make a decent and competitive league team.  So I might start doing that next year.</p><div class='title'><b>Pokedex Completion History</b></div><p>Nearly 10 years ago, I picked up Pokemon Emerald and played it quite a bit with my girlfriend at the time.  We started doing this around the time Pokemon Fire Red and Leaf Green were released, so after we completed Emerald, I bought Fire Red, and she bought Leaf Green.  We ran through both games, and given our position, I suggested we could probably complete the Pokedex between the both of us.</p><p>We got close before giving up.  At the time, there were a possible 386 pokemon.  I think my Emerald pokedex was around 340, or 360, maybe?  For event pokemon, we had a Jirachi, but did not have Mew, Celebi, or Deoxys.</p><p>Then next time I really played Pokemon was when I studied abroad and Pokemon Diamond and Pearl were released in Fall 2006.  Later, back in the states, I bought Pokemon Platinum on its release, and went all the way through that game.  Throughout this time, I was collecting each event Pokemon upon its availability.  Pokemon Heart Gold and Soul Silver came out.  I started going through Soul Silver, but got bored.</p><p>When Pokemon White and Black were released, I actually had a friend who played and cared about the games, too.  I played through White and she played through Black.  We both caught all the exclusive Pokemon and traded them back and forth to complete our Pokedexes.</p><p>At this point, my dream to complete the Pokedex was rekindled.  Starting with Generation III (ruby / sapphire / emerald / leaf green / fire red), you could migrate your Pokemon to the next generation.  So all my Pokemon from Emerald could be moved to Platinum, and from Platinum to Pokemon White.  With my hefty amount of Pokemon from Emerald, and complete saves on Platinum and White, I was able to fill out the new rosters, and get closer.</p><p>I bought some of the older copies of the games to fill out the starters I was missing.  And I even bought a new Nintendo DS, so I could trade and transfer Pokemon between the Gen IV and Gen V games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_2219.webp" /></p><p>This was about 4 years ago.  After the release of Black and White 2, my Pokedex on Pokemon White was at 647 out of 649.  I was missing at Latios, which was available to capture in Pokemon Soul Silver, but I just got so bored playing that game.  And I was missing Meloetta, which was an event Pokemon not yet released.  Almost complete!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9696.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, Meloetta was released after I starting living in Japan, so I had no way of getting it.  Maybe I had a chance while in Japan, but I missed that opportunity.</p><p>Pokemon X and Y came out last year, bumping the total amount of Pokemon to 718, with an additional 3 event Pokemon yet to be released, announced, or even available in the Pokedex.  Pokemon X was rather boring, though.  There were very few new Pokemon, and the controls were somewhat rocky especially after playing Zelda.  I captured all the Pokemon, though, and during Christmas break, traded back and forth to complete the new set.</p><p>At the time, there was also no built-in way to transfer Gen IV Pokemon to the new games.  Later, an app was released, Pokemon Bank, that allowed you to do this.  I got bored with Pokemon X, so I left it.</p><p>But, ramping up to the release of Omega Ruby, and the release of Diancie, the 719th Pokemon, I started getting into Pokemon again.  I migrated all my Pokemon forward, and filled in any holes I was missing in my Pokedex.  I was now at 717, with only Meloetta and Latios missing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9697.webp" /></p><p>Playing through Omega Ruby, they basically just give you Latios for free.  You don't even need to battle and catch it.  It felt somewhat empty to have finally catch this Pokemon without even a fight, but whatever.  *My Pokemon X Dex is still at 717, though, because I'm too lazy too transfer it.</p><p>I transferred all my Pokemon over to Omega Ruby, but I do not actually have a living "copy" of Aromatisse and Yveltal (from Pokemon X/Y), so my Omega Ruby Dex is at 716.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9699_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141221_pokemon/IMG_9678_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing the journey from 10 years ago to 4 years ago to today, these are the games and handhelds I have with me in Japan.  There are still some Pokemon left to capture and transfer from Soul Silver, so I might start playing that again.  My save is just after catching Lugia, and before Victory Road.</p><p>Anyway, <b>I'm so close!</b>  I'm only missing 3 pokemon, and the additional 2 yet unreleased event pokemon.  (Though, #720 Hoppa might be soon.)</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing</b></div><p>After playing the shit out of Pokemon White, I became more interested in some of the meta-game aspects of raising and breeding pokemon.  I designed, and started training a balanced EV trained team.  I completely trained 3 pokemon out of the 6 I had planned before I got bored, and gave up.</p><p>I started playing Pokemon X again right before Omega Ruby's release, and EV trained some more pokemon.  EV training is SO easy in Gen VI.  I am so thankful for that.  I completely trained 2 pokemon in that game.</p><p>And with Omega Ruby, I bred and EV trained 4 pokemon in Pokemon X, transferred them to Omega Ruby, and played through all of the game with them.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, with these pokemon, I think I'll make a team, and start competing online.  Why not, right?  With my sole goal of pokemon (finishing the Pokedex) basically complete, I should start getting into the aspect of pokemon that has really kept the franchise alive: battling and competing.</p><p>We'll see, though, maybe I'll lose a lot, get bored, and give up.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next?</b></div><p>I'm super interested to see what they have planned next.  With the addition of Mega evolutions, I think they've pretty much run out of ideas to keep Pokemon fresh.  Pokemon releases are now almost a yearly occurrence.</p><p>2007 = Pokemon Diamond + Pearl<br/>2009 = Pokemon Platinum<br/>2010 = Pokemon Heart Gold + Soul Silver<br/>2011 = Pokemon Black + White<br/>2012 = Pokemon Black + White 2<br/>2013 = Pokemon X + Y<br/>2014 = Pokemon Omega Ruby + Alpha Sapphire</p><p>I could totally see a Pokemon Z (or whatever) coming out in 2015, too.  Maybe that game would bring over all the engine fixes in Omega Ruby, and also correctly bridge the two games.  And perhaps have a lot of good end game content, too.</p><p>But, they really need to take a break.  Pokemon needs some breathing room.</p><p>Anyway, that's my story.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Video Game shopping in Toyama 富山市" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-shopping-in-toyama">Video Game shopping in Toyama 富山市</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 6, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When shopping for video games in Japan, I think a lot of people think about going to Akihabara in Tokyo, or perhaps Den Den Town in Osaka, or one of the other popularized meccas of video game and anime nerdom.  But, if you've ever gone to any popularized retro gaming place in the U.S., their selection is great, but their prices typically are not.  Much like the U.S., there are tons of used stores throughout the country, and they usually yield better scores.</p><p>I currently live in Takayama in Gifu, and while the gaming stores are pathetic in my city, Toyama <span class='ja'>富山市</span>, an hour and a half to the north, has quite a few, for some reason.  Gifu City <span class='ja'>岐阜市</span>, Kanazawa <span class='ja'>金沢市</span>, Matsumoto <span class='ja'>松本市</span>, and Nagoya <span class='ja'>名古屋</span> are within the same distance and time frame (in different directions), but they don't have nearly the cache Toyama does.  I don't know why.</p><p>I hadn't been on a video game shopping trip in quite a while, and my brother-in-law recently decided to repair and mod his Super Nintendo for import games.  He asked me to search for some games, along with the list of Famicom games I've been working on.</p><p>I'm not completely familiar with the Super Famicom library, but whatever. Let's go!</p><div class='title'><b>Shuttle <span class='ja'>シャトル</span> in Tonami <span class='ja'>砺波</span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8351.webp" /></p><p>I left my house around 8:30am, and went directly the first place on my list.  This was my first time going to Shuttle.  To find used game stores using Google Maps, I usually search for <span class='ja'>ファミコン</span>, and that pulls up stores that carry Famicom games.  Chances are if they carry those games, they carry all games.  Shuttle is the only thing that came up for Toyama, for some reason.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8354_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8355_t.webp"/></a></p><p>And Shuttle did not disappoint.  It's a massive nerd store with games, figures, porn, books, manga, fishing equipment, guns, cards, and some other stuff.  I started sifting through the Super Famicom games.

Nintendo 3DS, DS, and Playstation 3 tend to dominate the shelves.  PSP and Playstation 2 still have decent sized sections, though.  Vita is tiny.

They had a few Playstation 4 games.</p><p>I peered through the 3DS games, and a game called <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8391.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141005_games/IMG_8391.webp">J Legend Series <span class='ja'>列伝</span></a> caught my eye.

Some of which were probably bad decisions on my part.  </p><p>Ugh, I feel pretty dumb running out there without looking for something more specific.  Again, I'm not completely familiar with the Super Famicom library.  There's gotta be some other baller import games.</p><div class='title'><b>Shopping</b></div><p>This is pretty typical for my video game shopping excursions in Japan.  I had been to some of these places before, so I already had an idea of what they had, and how long to spend inside.  These stores aren't that much different than what you'd find in any mid-level city.  Though, Toyama seems to have a few more stores than other nearby cities.</p><p>Towards the end of the day, I was skipping over some stores on my list.  There is another Hard Off near the Manga Warehouse, but I was mostly cached for the day.  I'm sure there are plenty of other hidden gems in Toyama, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Cards Against Humanity PAX East Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">Cards Against Humanity PAX East Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Some of these came out of PAX East, and the others followed a month or two afterward.  The updates include the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" /></p><p>2012 Holiday Pack<br/>2013 Holiday Pack<br/>90s Nostalgia Pack<br/>Pwnmeal 2014 PAX East Cards<br/>Crabs Adjust Humidity vol. 3</p><p>The 90s packs were available at PAX East, but are now available for everyone on the Cards Against Humanity website, along with the 2012 and 2013 Holiday Packs.  The Crabs vol. 3 set can be purchased from the Vampire Squid website along with the previous volumes.  The Pwnmeal cards on the other hand…</p><div class='title'><b>PWNMeal</b></div><p>With the recent explosion of food products advertised to gamers as "Extreme Gamer Fuel," Max Tempkin, the co-creator of Cards Against Humanity, and current boss, had a twitter conversation about its ridiculousness with his friends.  This turned into a back-and-forth about dumb names for foods they haven't come up with yet.  When the topic of extreme oatmeal was introduced, Max had an idea that he could not stop himself from completing.</p><p>On April 12th, at PAX East in Boston, Max unveiled PWNMeal at the Giant Bomb Panel.</p><p><br/>Cards Against Humanity created 150,000 package of PWNMeal, and gave them out to as many people as they could at PAX East.  Each PAX East swag bag included one pouch of PWNMeal.  </p><p>There are 4 different flavors of PWNMeal: Strawberries and Carnage, No Scope Headshot Blueberry, MOBAnana Bread, and Cinnamon K/D Ratioatmeal.  And they were complete with a prize inside!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" /></p><p>Each PWNMeal package contains 10 cards for Cards Against Humanity: 8 white cards, and 2 black cards, of which there are a total of 27 different cards.</p><p>I bought a few packages from eBay after PAX East had finished.  I think I paid about $10 for each package.</p><p>Here's the distribution of cards I received from the 5 packs:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" /></p><p>I'm still missing 4 cards: #12, #17, #22, and #25.  Unlike the PAX Prime 2013 cards, these seem pretty evenly distributed.  Seems like the first 10 are common.  The second 10 are slightly less common, but not too bad.  I think I just got unlucky with the black cards.</p><p>There are still some unfunny PAX memes and inside jokes, but for the most part, these cards aren't too bad.  There are some good additions. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Expansions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" /></p><p>With these new additions, I own the following official expansions:</p><p>An original set of Cards Against Humanity (I'm not sure which version)<br/>The First, Second, Third, and Fourth (Official) Expansions<br/>The Holiday 2012, Holiday 2013, Box, and 90s Nostalgia Packs<br/>The PAX East 2013, PAX Prime 2013, and PAX East 2014 PWNMeal Packs</p><p>And the following unofficial expansions:</p><p>The UK Expansion (Bootleg - read about it here: <a href="/old/v7/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions" title="/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions">February 10th, 2014</a>)<br/>and.. Crabs Adjust Humidity volumes One, Two, and Three.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" /></p><p>Now, my Bigger Blacker Box is 100% full.  That expansion box holds all of my blank cards.  I think I'm going to need to buy a second box to store some cards.</p><div class='title'><b>Missing</b></div><p>There are still 4 official release from Cards Against Humanity that I'm missing:  The Canada Conversion Set, the Reject Pack, the House of Cards pack, and the PAX East 2014 Panel Packs.</p><p><b>Canada Conversion Set</b> is a small set of cards included with the Canadian version of the game.  Rather than create a completely separate Canadian version of the game, the creators simply released the same version of the game for Canada, but added a small pack of localized cards that were Canada specific.  I don't think these cards are marked in anyway.  Plus they're Canada specific, so they aren't that funny to me.  It's not really worth it for me to buy it.</p><p><b>The Reject Pack</b> is a small package of several cards rejected from the original release of the game.  Each card was selected by one of the creators of the game, and features a drawing of their portrait at the bottom of the card.  These packs were given away at fan events.  Sometimes they were given to people with corrected orders.  They show up on eBay every now and then, but sell for $100.</p><p><i>Update</i>: Actually, some retailers are selling these on amazon for $10.  I bought two packs from one of the sellers. It's possible that they're bootleg, though.</p><p><b>House of Cards Pack</b> was something I totally and completely missed.  Netflix and Cards joined together and released a pack of cards based of the House of Cards television program available on Netflix.  This happened in January (or February) this year.  There are some on eBay, but sell for $60.</p><p><b>PAX East 2014 Panel Packs</b>:  In addition to the PWNMeal cards at PAX East, the creators of Cards Against Humanity performed another crazy feat of marketing.  They held a panel on Saturday, and during the panel the audience suggested cards to the panelists.  The top 10 cards were compiled, and sent to a print-shop.  They were completed overnight, and handed out to the attendees the following day.  Around 200 of these cards were made, and only given to those who attended the panel.</p><div class='title'><b>Quality over Quantity</b></div><p>As they say, with so many cards, it can difficult to have some quality sessions of Cards Against Humanity.  Some of those Crabs cards just aren't funny, and don't really work in most situations.  The next time I get a chance to play with friends, I'm going to start separating the shitty useless cards into a separate pile.  Hence the need for a second black box. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tomodachi Life - Fashion Catalog" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tomodachi-life-fashion-catalog">Tomodachi Life - Fashion Catalog</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 16, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, Nintendo released <b>Tomodachi Life</b> on the Nintendo 3DS in the US.  It's a life simulation game which you create, or import Miis on your island, and they all live together, make friends with each other, marry each other, and have children. :)  Also, you give your Mii presents, and feed them, which makes their happiness meter go up.  They gain levels this way.  Each new level awards them with a special gift, either a catch phrase, a song, or some kind of permanent present.</p><p>The entertainment of the game is creating a bunch of Miis of your friends, or celebrities, and having them all interact with each other.</p><p>For example, the female Matt Rorey (of Giant Bomb) had feelings for Batman, so she confessed her love.  But then Samus broke in and confessed her love.  Batman chose Samus, and eventually they got married.  Matt Rorey eventually got over Batman when Shaq O'Neil confessed his love for her.  A few days later Matt Rorey asked Shaq for marriage, and he said yes. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Here's some of the Miis at their wedding.  There's Jesse Pinkman, me, Miyamoto, Tyrion Lannister, Alex Nevarro (of Giant Bomb), Batman, Weird Al, and Mr. Bean.</p><div class='title'><b>QR Codes</b></div><p>A really nice feature of Tomodachi Life is being able to share your Mii across the Internet using a QR Code.  Through the menus in the game, you can generate a code for yourself, and others can import you in their game.  It only imports my likeness, and settings.  I can't actually interact with anyone.  But the Miis basically just do whatever they want anyway.</p><p>Here's my Mii, if you'd like me in your game:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Additionally, Nintendo has created some special Miis based on celebrities you can import into your game with custom backgrounds, and clothes.  There's Christina Aguilera, Shaquille O'Neal, Debby Ryan, Shaun White, and Zendaya.  You can find those codes <a href="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/" title="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/">here</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japanese Special Miis</b></div><p>It's been over a year since its release in Japan.  I figured that they did something similar with the Japanese release.  It took me a while to find any official Miis for the game, but eventually I found <a href="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html" title="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html">this website</a>.</p><p>A few months after the Japanese release in April 2013, Club Nintendo released a book called <b>Tomodachi Collection - Fashion Catalog</b>.  It's 88 pages of custom Miis showing off various clothing items you can collect in the game.  Here's the <a href="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html" title="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html">official page</a>.</p><p>Since I wanted a ton of Miis, I went through an imported each one.  They each have gold pants, too!  But, all of them have Japanese names, which my US game won't pronounce.  Since they're special, I can't edit them either.</p><p>Additionally, I have no idea who they are.  Are all these Miis based on Japanese celebrities?  Or are they athletes.  I don't know, so I'm gonna go through each one and write up my findings.</p><div class='title'><b>Findings</b></div><p>Well, it didn't take too long after searching for these characters to realize they're all made up.  </p><p>Unlike the celebrity Miis on Nintendo of America's website, these characters were specifically made up for this catalog.  Throughout the catalog, the Miis show off all these clothes.  Every clothing item in the catalog is attached to the Mii character, so when you import them into your game, you get all their items.  But, then you're stuck with this Mii.</p><p><b>None of this works in the US version of the game.</b>  When you import the Mii, you're given the stock Mii character and none of their items.  So, they're really pointless, unless you want to expand the Mii population of game quickly.  Also, since they're special, if you delete them, you cannot reimport them.  Maybe in the future, Nintendo will patch the game for these Miis to work.  But even so, I've already imported them, so I've already ruined that chance.</p><p>All in all, <b>there's very little use to actually importing these characters in your America game</b>.  But, here's all the codes if you want a bunch of gold panted Miis in your game:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><img

| February 10, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of my favorite games these days is Cards Against Humanity.  For those who don't know about this game, it started as a Kickstarter 3 years ago.  Some friends in Chicago came up with a game similar to Apples to Apples but with much more hilarious or horrible responses depending on your point of view.</p><p>To play, all players draw 10 white cards.  White cards are usually nouns, phrases, or whatever.  Someone is chosen as the card czar, and they draw a single black card.  The read the black card, which is either a fill-in-the-blank, or a question, and the other players use one of their white cards to complete the black card.  The card czar then chooses the "best" card, which can be on any criteria they wish be it appropriate, inappropriate, or just funny.  The player whose white card was chosen gets the black card, and the person with the most amount of black cards wins the game.</p><p>I first bought my copy of the game at Pax Prime 2012.  At that time, there were 2 official expansions.  SInce then, there's been quite a bit more.  All in all, there's the following add-ons:</p><p>First, Second, Third, and Fourth (Official) Expansions<br/>Holiday Expansion (Christmas 2012)<br/>12 Days of Holiday Bullshit (Christmas 2013)<br/>PAX East 2013 Promo Packs<br/>PAX Prime 2013 Promo Packs<br/>(The ever elusive) Reject Pack<br/>The Bigger, Blacker Box (which includes the Box Expansion)<br/>and.. Crabs Adjust Humidity Volumes One and Two (Fan expansion from one of the creators)</p><p>Again, I'm a huge fan of the game, so I have everything listed above EXCEPT for the <b>Reject Pack</b> which has never been sold, and may not even be in production anymore.  People have said they've gotten it from events in Chicago, and sometimes when they've had to order replacement cards.</p><p>Here's my collection from after PAX Prime 2013 after purchasing the Box and getting most of the PAX Prime cards</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/photo.webp" /></p><p>Since then, I've added the Fourth Expansion, the Christmas 2013 Cards, and Crabs Adjust Humidity Volume Two.  And now, I've added one more thing...</p><div class='title'><b>Localized Editions</b></div><p>In addition, Cards Against Humanity has released a version in Canada and the UK with localized cards.  The Canadian edition only has a few changes, so the box includes a base USA set with an extra box labeled the Canada Expansion.  This is not available on its own, and the only way to get it is through Amazon Canada which doesn't ship to the US.</p><p>The UK Edition released overseas is much more localized.  So much so that there is no little expansion included in the box, it's all mixed in.  Several of the base USA cards have been changed slightly to reflect the English dialect over American.  Several USA cards have been dropped, with UK specific cards added as replacements.  They've gone to great lengths to actually make a UK version of the game, rather than just tacking on a couple cards.</p><p>Much like the Canadian edition of the game, annoying collectors and completists, such as myself, want to add these cards to my deck, even though there's plenty of English idioms I either won't get, or think are as funny as the US counterpart.</p><p>I was searching around eBay for both these localized editions (and the Reject Pack), and I came across the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3467.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The UK Expansion</b></div><p>Some seller from the UK, had this listed on eBay.  The "UK Expansion" it reads, and looks all official.  At the time, I searched around the internets, but didn't really see anything about it.  Everything kept coming up UK <u>Edition</u>, not Expansion.  But still, I was really curious.  Well, it was only $20 shipped, and would go anywhere in the world.  Why not?  I'll buy it and have it shipped to my place in Japan.</p><p>and It arrived today!  So here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3469.webp" /></p><p>Oh yeah?  This thing is counterfeit.  The outside of the box is set to look exactly like the other expansions.  Lots of care was taken in making this thing look official.  Right down to the little version number each official Edition and Expansion has printed on the box.</p><p>The biggest give away are the cards themselves.  While they are the correct font, correct size, and basically the correct weight, there's no linen finish on the cards that give them the "player card" texture and feel.  They're just straight matte card stock.  It makes them feel pretty flimsy and cheap.</p><p>You can see it pretty well in this photo:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3473.webp" /></p><p>But, honestly, while the card quality themselves is a pretty big deal, it's the only fault of these cards.  Everything else is damn near perfect.  A user on the Boardgame Geek forum wrote up a review about these cards as well, and details all the cards included in this set.  Weirdly, the set is actually missing a few cards from the UK Edition of the game.  And then included some US cards from the 1.5 version of the base set.</p><p>http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1119851/review-of-the-not-official-125-card-uk-expansion</p><p>But, overall, not bad.  They're even labeled as UK expansion, so you can easily tell them apart from the normal cards.  Though, the card stock is a real easy way to do that without even needing to look.  With the addition of this set, my Bigger, Blacker Box is nearly full!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140210_cahuk/IMG_3482.webp" /></p><p>The extra box in there contains all my empty custom cards.  If I completed all those, I don't think I could fit another expansion.</p><div class='title'><b>Quantity over Quality</b></div><p>There is a down side to having all these cards, though.  How many times have you been playing this game, and have totally unplayable cards?  It's happens very often.  I think with the base set and the expansions, there were actually thinking about how to expand the deck and have more playable cards.  Ones that actually cleverly work with the black cards, and create more plausible, cohesive combinations.</p><p>But with the PAX cards, the Christmas cards, and DEFINITELY the Crabs cards, so many of the white cards turn into dead ends, and the hilarious combinations get lost with all the noise.</p><p>I think the next times that I play with friends, I'm going to start culling some cards and get rid of the fluff.  Collecting and completing collections is fun, but there's still the game to play underneath.  The collection shouldn't get in the way of that.  My deck needs to be tighter.  :)</p><p>I think the box is a good bar for the amount of cards any person should have.  Anymore, and you continue to dilute the quality of the hands you'll draw.  Plus, it's not like you'll actually finish a game to completion.  With just the base set and two expansions, it took about 4 or 5 hours to play through all the cards.  And now my box has more than twice that!</p><p>Though, I will say, I think the more black cards the better.  I don't think there are really any terrible black cards.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyway?</b></div><p>So, anyway, that's the UK Expansion.  It is counterfeit, so take that into consideration if you're thinking of buying it.  I haven't had a chance to play any games with the new cards, but hopefully I won't need to wait too long.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Bravely Default Demo" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/bravely-default-demo">Bravely Default Demo</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 13, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Probably my most hyped game at the moment is Bravely Default on the 3DS.  It's a semi-classic style Final Fantasy JRPG with artwork by Akihiko Yoshida.  It's the spiritual successor to The Heroes of Light on the DS, which itself was a spiritual remake of Final Fantasy 1.</p><p>Akihiko Yoshida was one of my favorite artists from Squaresoft during the Playstation era.  He did the artwork for Final Fantasy Tactics, and Vagrant Story, and then, more recently, Final Fantasy XII.  Though, Bravely Default does not fall in that universe.  He works a lot with Yasumi Matsuno, who designed all those games, too.</p><p>It was originally released in 2012, and is finally coming out in the US in about a month.  Two weeks ago, Nintendo released a demo on the eShop.  The demo is mostly stand alone.  It contains no story, and very little character interaction, and you're placed in an area that doesn't even exist in the full game.  It's simply meant to show off the Job system, the battle system, and the Street Pass stuff.  As well as part of the world, and the music, too.  As you progress through the demo, you unlock stuff you can transfer to the full game. :)</p><p>I started playing the demo yesterday, and it looks gorgeous.  Yoshida's art style is represented perfectly.  The characters and their costumes are vibrant and unique.  The enemies look really nice, too.  I love the flat look used in the village and the battles.  It doesn't compromise style for realism.</p><p>The demo itself is rather grindy, due to the lack of story, but I think it's still pretty fun.  You get a simple kill or fetch quest, complete it, then do the next one.  The jobs cap at level 4, so it allows you to experiment with several jobs and job combinations.</p><p>The Brave & Default battle system is pretty unique, and rather easy to understand.  When it's your character's turn, in addition to attack, magic, etc, you can choose to either Brave or Default.  Defaulting essentially saves a turn for later, and your character is put in defensive mode for the rest of the turn.  Brave will use multiple turns per round, up to 4.  You can only stock 3 turns, and going negative is OK, but characters can only participate in a round if they have 0 or more stocked turns. Stocked turns are simply called Brave points.</p><p>So, I pretty much just stock up on turns and then release a ton of moves in a single round later.  The extra defense from Defaulting is almost necessary for not getting killed right away.</p><p>This game does feature random battles, but in the settings, you can change the frequency of the encounter rate.  You can change is to 0 when you want to explore.  Or up it to 100, when you need to grind out some levels.</p><p>The demo is kinda long, too.  I think I'm about halfway through at 4 hours, and I've only unlocked two of the seven prize packs I can bring into the full game.</p><p>If you were a fan of Squaresoft back in the Playstation days, I would definitely recommend playing through the demo, and deciding whether or not this game is for you.  I've been pretty excited for this game, and the demo has definitely reassured me. :)</p><p>Also, if you have a Japanese 3DS, the recent re-release of the game with the subtitle, For the Sequel, is (nearly) the exact same game out in Europe now, and coming out in the US next month.  It has full English support, and I think might not have the censoring they added for the western market.</p><p><a href="http://bravelydefault.nintendo.com/demo" title="http://bravelydefault.nintendo.com/demo">http://bravelydefault.nintendo.com/demo</a><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/8">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/6">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
