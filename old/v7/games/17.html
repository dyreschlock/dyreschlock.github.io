| March 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, Bioware released the first in a series of downloadable episodes for Mass Effect on the Xbox 360.  Being an adoring fan of Mass Effect I quickly purchased this new $5 episode and finally finished the 3 hour episode a week and a half later.</p><p>Bring down the Sky is a pluggable episode that squeezes itself into the middle of Mass Effect.  It takes place on Asteroid X57 near Terra Nova in the something cluster, which you can reach once you get free rein to explore the Milky Way Galaxy.  You can not access this once you've completed the game, which could be considered a pain in the ass to some players.  It took me about 3 or 4 hours to run through Eden Prime and all the required crap on the Citadel to finally start flying around.</p><p>That's the main reason why I didn't finish Bring down the Sky in one sitting.  All my free time that night was spent getting to the point where I could start it.  Also, I was playing on the insane difficulty, so some things took a little longer than usual.</p><p>In Bring down the Sky, you are faced with a Batarian regime who have taken over the science facilities on Asteroid X57 and have changed the trajectory to collide with Terra Nova, whose colonies consist of some 6 million inhabitants.  Once landed on the asteroid, you can see the brilliant Terra Nova as you loom closer to doom.  It reminds me a lot of Armageddon, actually.  Luckily, you don't need to drill through the surface and destroy the asteroid.  You just need to shut of the thrusters and regain control of the science facilities to fix everything.</p><p>This expansion does feature a couple new Assets to Mass Effect.  The large thrusters bored into the asteroid are new from the download, as well as the Batarians themselves.  We never did get to see the Batarians in the main game, but this expansion does offer reasons why they were left out.</p><p>Overall, Bring down the sky is more robust than the other side quests already in the game.  The experience is tighter and self-contained with actual cutscenes throughout the experience leading you on to the next station.  It has a more theatrical introduction and conclusion, but still keeps a sandbox approach to how you handle the outcome.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>The only complaint I have about Bring down the Sky is the ending.  It really annoys me that you are given 2 choices at the end and you can only do one or the other.  You cannot defeat the extremist leader AND save the hostages he's acquired.  You can do this in all other scenarios throughout the game, but you cannot in this one.  AND, to make matters worse, during the epilogue to the episode, everyone keeps second guessing your choices.</p><p>So, not only can't you do both, but the game judges either decision you make as the wrong one.  I even went back and saved the hostages the second time rather than killing the leader and they STILL are ungrateful.  ARHghaghghgh</p><p>You pay $5 for a few hours of entertainment and there's no scenario where the game won't complain about what you've done.  Maybe I'll go back and kill the hostages again just to shut them up.  At least I get Renegade points for that.. I don't get Paragon points for saving the hostages.<br/>/Spoilers</p><p>Anyways, I'd definitely recommend this if you like Mass Effect and have already completed one play through.  You don't need to beat the game to play this, but if you haven't finished Mass Effect, you should probably do that before you add more content to extend the game.</p><p>Also, Bring down the sky gives you another 50 achievement points ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Coming back to Mass Effect</b></div><p>Coming back into Mass Effect from playing World of Warcraft these past few months was a much needed breath of fresh air.  WOW is so completed void of emotion, it almost completely numbs me to play.  It has tremendous back story and all that, but that's not the point of WOW at all.  WOW is all about the end game level of play, reaching 70 and then actually building your character.  and continuing to build your character.</p><p>There's really no aspect of playing the game how you want because the point is to "be good" at it, and if you don't do little things how you're supposed, everyone starts complaining to you about it.  "You're in the wrong zone", "You're doing worthless quests", "Abandon all those crappy quests", "Put out your buffs", "Why do you have one point in another skill tree".</p><p>I feel no freedom in the game.  I'm really just a slave to how the game is played well.  Which is absolutely the opposite of what I want from an MMO.</p><p>Maybe it's just because I hang out with people who've played the game for the past 4 years its been in the market though, but I constantly miss the type of freedom I felt when playing Ultima Online.  I felt no pressure to do anything in Ultima Online.  I could just run off into the woods and be a hermit if I wanted.  I could build a shack in the woods, outfit it with fencer training stuff and buff my character that way.  I could actually explore the world where no one had ever been, and monsters were very sparse.</p><p>I really can't play World of Warcraft that much anymore..  It's too annoying and gives me a headache whenever I think about it.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, about Mass Effect</b></div><p>Anywho, I started a new game in Mass Effect to be able to play Bring down the Sky.  This is my third play through and I started off on my level 59 character, which was still 100,000 experience away from the game's level cap.  Through the first areas of the game I got up to 792,000, still 68,000 short of the cap.  After finishing the new episode I'm at 820,000, still 40,000 from the cap.  Sigh...</p><p>Also, my game is now on the Insane difficulty which is actually challenging!  It's actually pretty fun to actual use parts of the environment for cover and not being able to run in the middle of battle and kill everyone.  Each skirmish takes a little tact to fish out the enemies into the open to beat them down.  Moving around your party members is actually helpful!  Sweet.  Too bad is takes 50 hours into the game to unlock it.</p><p>I don't see why you have to unlock the more difficult difficulties when the options you have are pretty easy in the first place.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gyakuten Saiban / Ace Attorney Timeline" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gyakuten-saiban-ace-attorney-timeline">Gyakuten Saiban / Ace Attorney Timeline</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>If you've played through any Phoenix Wright game, you may notice that Date and Time stamped onto the beginning of every scene in the game.  When playing through these games.. I wonder..  is it really consistent?</p><p>In the 2nd one, Wright says he's been a lawyer for one year.  In the third one, he's says he's been a lawyer for two years.  So the first 3 games take place a year apart.  And Apollo Justice comes into the scene seven years later.  The third games deals a lot with events both past and present for the whole series.  Apollo Justice does a fair amount of flash-backing too, but it sticks to that 7 year period after the first three games.</p><p>They never really say what year it is though..  but there is one piece of evidence in the entire franchise that places a year on one event, which in turn places a year on all events.  That's the good 'ol DL-6 Incident file from the fourth case of the first game.  The DL-6 Incident took place on December 28th, 2001, 15 years prior to the fourth case.  So Phoenix Wright 1 begins in 2016, Phoenix Wright 2 in 2017, Phoenix Wright 3 in 2018 and 2019, with Apollo Justice in the year 2026.  Weird..  but it makes sense with all the futuristic crap that is subtley put into some cases..  like Godot's visor.</p><p>Anyways, I made a list of events in Gyakuten Saiban series with when they took place and with whom.</p><p><b>UPDATE (9/28/2010)</b>: I'm playing through Ace Attorney Edgeworth or Gyakuten Kenji at the moment, so I'm updating this time line as I go.<br/>_______</p><p>December 28th, 2001<br/><b>DL-6 Incident</b> -

I have some disappointments, but overall I'm quite pleased with the game.</p><p><b>Timeshift</b> (spoiler-heavy)</p><p>The riskiest thing about the game is playing as Apollo Justice, 7 years past the previous game.  This offers a very healthy restart to the franchise and takes the series in a new direction.  Honestly, I think they had exhausted all their options with Edgeworth and the Fey family.  It was time for the series to move forward, rather than backward.  But I think they put a little too much behind them when making this transition.</p><p>Phoenix Wright is in Apollo Justice and is the center of attention, but many of the other characters are gone.  Not a single mention of Edgeworth or the Fey Family.  No Franziska, No Gumshoe.  The only other 'blast from the past' is Ema Skye who was introduced in the DS only chapter of Phoenix Wright 1.  She has taken Gumshoe's place as lead detective.</p><p>I guess it's assumed that Edgeworth and Maya went their merry way elsewhere.  Pearl, too.  I'd like to know what happened.  Maybe that will be the focus of Gyakuten Saiban 5?</p><p><b>New Main Character</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>The thing reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 2.  Phoenix Wright is still in the game, but he's like a mentor / background character for the better part of the game.  It's not until the final chapter, when you play as him, that his whole story takes center stage and shows exactly how Apollo Justice is caught up in it.  Kinda like MGS2.  You start off as Snake, but his story is cut short.  Then all of sudden, you're playing as Raiden and have no idea why until it all becomes clear in the final act.</p><p>I have a feeling Gyakuten Saiban 5 is going to be a lot like MGS4 or perhaps Halo 3, where you have the main characters of the franchise side-by-side using their detective and analytic techniques together.</p><p><b>Perceiving</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>Speaking of which.. Phoenix Wright's detection vice was using the Magatama and discovering Psyche-Locks in people.  Locks that locked memories from the people view that you can unlock by shoving truth into their faces.  Unlocking those memories helped you dig deeper into the truth.</p><p>Apollo Justice has a vice of his own, Perceiving, which, just like the Magatama, is integral to his character's story.  To perceive, Apollo will feel tension in his bracelet which gives him the idea that this person is lying to him.  When perceiving, you look VERY closely at your subject.  You search them for a 'tell' or 'habit' they might do when they're lying.  Once you know exactly what they're lying about, you can use evidence or coercion to force the truth out of them.</p><p>In this game, the only time you perceive is in court.  There is never an instance outside of court that the game allows you to perceive.  But that's where the Magatama comes into play in the final act when uncovering all the mysteries of the past 7 years.</p><p><b>In the series..</b> (no real spoilers)</p><p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the game.  Even though, it missed the mark of the previous characters in the series, it did a great job pulling Apollo Justice and other new characters into the series.  I'm still somewhat annoyed at those chapters that aren't relevant to the overall story, though.  In this case, the second chapter really had nothing to do with the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  Though, I guess it did bring back Ema Skye and plenty of forensic investigation.</p><p>Placing it into the series, though.  I would say Apollo Justice is on par with the first Phoenix Wright game.  Phoenix Wright 3 is my favorite, whereas Phoenix Wright 2 is my least favorite.  Don't get me wrong, Phoenix Wright 2 is essential for the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban, but the music really pulls down the game.  You need to play Phoenix Wright 2 to appreciate all the story in Phoenix Wright 3.</p><p>Apollo Justice is kind of on its own plane though.  You don't really need to play the previous games to appreciate the story.  You could start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice and not be lost or miss anything.  All you'd really need to know is that Phoenix Wright is a good, clever lawyer.</p><p>Though, if you did start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice, you'd totally be spoiled by the 3D aspects.  I would rather hold Apollo Justice as a treat for playing through the first 3 games, than go start for the desert.</p><p><b>Gyakuten Saiban</b> (no spoilers)</p><p>After completing Apollo Justice, I still want more.  I love the characters, the story, the humor, the music.  The whole domestic version of the Gyakuten Saiban series is fantastic.  If you haven't played through them, I ask that you give it another try. ^_^  These 4 games are some of the best the DS has the offer.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 5 is at the top of my hype-wagon ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b><em>Update</em></b></div><p>After peering around, I found some news on Gyakuten Saiban 5.</p><p><em>When Shu Takumi was exclusively interviewed, he said that GS5 will still be on DS and it will be the last one for the series. However, it doesn't mean that there will be no new GS games, but rather the end of stories about Phoenix. After that, GS will become a totally new game and have nothing to do with the old series.</em></p><p><em>He also stated that GS4 was a "test" game. Thanks to the high sale record of GS4, the staff aren't worried about introducing a new story.</em></p><p><em>However, before the new game series can start, the current GS series must come to an end and GS5 will be the farewell show. GS5 will break the record of GS1's DS remake and become the longest one of the whole series. Almost all the old characters will turn up and some hidden clues in GS1234 will be looked on. Some of the cases which seem to have nothing to do with each other will show a connection. In a word, everything will become clear in GS5. What made the players even more excited, Shu Takumi revealed that the final boss of the all darkness is not a fresh face but someone we are quite familiar with! This person control all in the dark, who can he/she be?</em></p><p><em>Shu Takumi also said the most of the script has been finished and the game producing is on its way. There is also a piece of news which may let the players down: it's probably the last time that Shu Takumi will take part in writing the script for GS. From now on, other people will take over his work.</em></p><p>It seems like suspicions are correct.  Number 5 will tie everything together, but it seems it will also end it all.  Oh well.  Rather put a definite end to a story rather than dragging it out forever.  I can't wait ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Playstation 3 and Blu-ray ramblings" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/playstation-3-and-blu-ray-ramblings">Playstation 3 and Blu-ray ramblings</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, Sony held a little press conference and called it Destination Playstation.  At this press event, Sony announced a bunch of information that I've been waiting for.  They announced the release date for <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b> and announced a bundle pack that includes Metal Gear Solid 4, an 80gb Playstation 3, and a Dual Shock 3.  All of this will hit shelves on June 12th, 2008 for a very reasonable price of $500.  For $500, I'll get the game I want, a Playstation 3 that'll play nearly all Playstation games and has decent harddrive space, and their "new" controller.  I don't even have to bother with owning a Sixaxis controller, I can skip right to the new controller.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" /></p><p>I'm pretty happy about this bundle.  SO happy, in fact, that I've begun taking an active look at what games I really want for the Playstation 3 and what Blu-ray movies I should by.</p><p>and thus...  rambling begins.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>Game-wise, there isn't a megaton of wealth out there, but there's a few things I'm interested in.  Two games that are already out are Uncharted and Stranglehold.</p><p><b>Uncharted</b> has been described as the perfect action movie come into the game scene.  The game takes a lot of cues from Die Hard, where you control a "regular" guy in extreme action situations.  I don't know all the details, but it sounds pretty fun.  Not $60 fun, of course.  I would definitely pick it up for $30, or perhaps stretch it to $35.  Used copies are floating around the $40~$45 mark.  That should go down by summer.</p><p><b>Stranglehold</b> is another "action movie" game.  Directed by John Woo and "starring" Chow Yun Fat, Stranglehold is the sequel to their first collaboration, Hard-boiled.  I've played the demo on Xbox and it is one of the most ridiculous games to come out last year.  I love it.  Not $60 love it, though.  This is another 30 spot, at best.  I wanted the PS3 collector's edition because it included the original Hard-boiled on Blu-ray, but now..  I don't really care.  I don't really care to watch Hard-boiled, and the game was developed for the Xbox.  I think I'll probably just pickup the 360 version when I find it for $20 or less.</p><p>Another game I want to pick up in <b>Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</b>, which is already out in Japan and April here in the US.  Though, paying $50 for a mere fraction of what will be Gran Turismo 5 is way too much.  It's the equivalent of a demo, really.  $50 for a demo is ridiculous, but it's really a showcase for the Playstation 3.  It shows off how good the graphics can be.  Maybe If I find a super cheap copy in Japan, I'll pick it up.  Like, $35 cheap..  :shrugs:, maybe not.</p><p>And that's it really.  There's not even anything else in development I'm terribly interesting in except for <b>Resident Evil 5</b>.  <b>Wipeout HD</b> is also kinda iffy..  that series really died for me after Designer Republic broke off from Psygnosis/Liverpool.</p><div class='title'><b>Movies</b></div><p>Something I did do immediately in celebration was purchase <b>Scanner Darkly</b> on Blu-ray for $20.  Hurrah, my first Blu-ray.  I started to take a look at what other movies I would want as well, but that momentum began to fizzle off.</p><p>Netflix is really helpful in keeping you from buying movies.  With every movie I came across, I thought to myself, "Am I really going to watch this more than once?"  I Love Scanner Darkly and would watch it a couple times over.  It's also that kind of movie that I would want to watch with people when they're around.  But other movies like that?</p><p><b>War of the Worlds</b> is another movie I was thinking of.  I would definitely love to see that in beautiful Hi-Definition, but all the other movies I came up with I already own or it wouldn't make a difference if I owned them on Blu-ray v. DVD.  Even Scanner Darkly is somewhat useless on Blu-ray because it's animated.  War of the Worlds isn't out of Blu-ray though..</p><p>There are some movies that are out on Blu-ray that caught my eye.  Like <b>Blade Runner</b>, <b>Wings of Honneamise</b>, and <b>Fifth Element</b>.  Each of these movies have been "remastered" for Blu-ray and weren't originally filmed with HD in mind.  How good could these movies really look compared to DVD.  Plus, how many times would I really watch them?  Wings of Honneamise would be spectacular except they don't even sell a stand-alone Blu-ray.  It comes with a DVD version and is $80?!</p><p>One movie I came across that could be amazing on Blu-ray is <b>Paprika</b>.  That movie was brilliantly gorgeous, but I didn't really like it.  The movie was all about the visuals and effects.  Purchasing it reminds me a lot of purchasing Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 on DVD back in the day.  I love those movies and thought it was a brilliant display of music and animation.. but now they just sit on the shelf.. taking up space.  Is that how Paprika will be in a year if I buy it?</p><p><b>Lost season 3</b> is out on Blu-ray..  but I already own the DVDs and I haven't even watched them yet!  Plus those Blu-rays are expensive..  screw that.</p><p>All-in-all, my little Blu-ray mania ended pretty quickly.  I have Scanner Darkly, will pick up War of the Worlds, and might buy Paprika.  I still have until mid-June anyways, so there's no rush on Paprika.  Also, I'll pick up <b>Cloverfield </b>on Blu-ray.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Even with owning a Playstation 3 in the future, it doesn't really seem worth it.  I'll play through Metal Gear, and then Uncharted.  But then it'll probably just sit there...  much like my PSP.  My Wii is the same way too.  I haven't touched my Wii since November.</p><p>Hopefully, owning a PS3 will revitalize my Playstation spirit and I'll finally start digging into my backlog of Playstation 2 games sitting on my shelf.  We'll see.</p><p>Also, HD isn't going to matter at all until I buy an HD TV.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Apollo Justice impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/apollo-justice-impressions">Apollo Justice impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 21, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, Apollo Justice was released and is probably my most anticipated game of 2008.  Apollo Justice is the fourth game in the Phoenix Wright / Ace Attorney / Gyakuten Saiban series by Capcom and takes the series in a new direction for a couple different angles.</p><p>First off, It's the first game in the series to be specifically developed for the DS from the ground up.  All the other PW games were simply ports from the Gameboy Advance.  The first game did have a DS only chapter at the end, which is really just a taste of what the could do with the series.  In Apollo Justice, the sprites are higher resolution, more detailed, and better colored, cut-scenes are now pre-compiled, rather than using sprite manipulation, and everything else you saw in Chapter 5 of Phoenix Wright 1.</p><p>The other huge change for the series is Apollo Justice as the main character.  Apollo Justice, the game, takes place at least 7 years after the end of Phoenix Wright 3, and you begin by defending Phoenix Wright whose been accused of murder.  Through defending him you become aware of your own power as an attorney, much like Phoenix did back in the day.  You overcome people's lies through 'perceiving the truth' by a tell or nervous twitch, rather than 'unlocking it' by seeing their Psyche-Locks.</p><p>Apollo Justice as the main lead is as huge a risk for the series as it is a change and is the largest criticism about the game.  I mean, the previous were named Phoenix Wright (in the US).  He is the game.  Games like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Halo 2 suffered greatly because of this criticism when you played as Raiden or the Arbiter.</p><p>Being a huge fan of Phoenix Wright, I wasn't really bothered by this.  One of my favorite moments in past Phoenix Wright games was playing as a different character and learning about Phoenix Wright from a different angle.  I cared about the Phoenix Wright universe and cast of characters as a whole that seeing it through the eyes of someone was a refreshing change of pace and offered a slew of new jokes and memes.</p><p>After playing for 2 hours, my only complaint about playing as Apollo Justice is that he's almost too much like Phoenix Wright in the beginning.  Though truly, if Phoenix Wright or any other previous character wasn't in this first case, it would have turned me off from the concept.  Phoenix Wright is the crucial immediate tie-in back to the series as a whole and is crucial in shaping Apollo Justice, the character, in becoming the next big thing.</p><p>In Apollo Justice, what I'm most interested in are the tie-ins back to the series as a whole and the future of the series.  When does this take place?  Why should I care about Apollo Justice?  Has this series jumped the shark?  Thankfully that first question was somewhat answered in the first 2 hours of the game.  Something has happened to Phoenix Wright 7 years ago that screwed up his lawyerin' career, and I'm sure that through the course of the game it will be revealed.</p><p>As for jumping the shark, there were several moments in Phoenix Wright 2 and 3 I felt that the series was stale.  The first couple cases felt like more of the same.  Phoenix Wright 2 is the biggest offender.  But, each game ended in a very satisfying way, and Phoenix Wright 3's ending pulled everything together.  It pulled together all the cases in the game, and all the characters and events from previous games.  I would probably not be as excited for Apollo Justice had Phoenix Wright 3 not ended so greatly.</p><p>And here I am now.  Apollo Justice continues with the same enthusiasm and hilariousness the makes the series great.  The first case is a great example of what makes these game fun to play. ^_^  I think this 'restart' of Phoenix Wright will keep fans of the first 3 games happy, as well as, present a good starting point for new people to join the series without playing the previous games (though I haven't played it enough to 100% stand by that assumption).</p><p>I'll let you know as time goes on ^_^.  If you haven't played any Phoenix Wright games, definitely pick up the first one and check it out.</p><p>Also, you can check out a mocked-up demo version of Apollo Justice on Flash here: <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x" title="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x">http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x</a></p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>Now that I'm playing Apollo Justice on the bus, I've stopped playing Brain Age 2 Sudoku for the time being.  I made it pretty far though with 91% completion.  Only 12 or 13 puzzles left to complete.  This is pretty close to make completion of Brain Age 1 Sudoku of 87%.  The Sudoku puzzles in the second game I found to be more challenging and interesting, rather than the first game where the difficult puzzles were just annoying.  The pacing of difficultly as the puzzles went on in Brain Age 2 was very subtle and really pushed you to use different techniques of counting from 1 to 9.  In Brain Age 1, it felt all over the place..</p><p>Though, maybe I've just grown as a Sudoku puzzler.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/castlevania-dracula-x-chronicles">Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the past couple of months my portable games device has been my PSP.  I've since I purchased my new slim PSP, I really haven't touched my DS except for a little Brain Age 2 Sudoku on trips.  Once Castlevania PSP came out, I've been hooked.</p><div class='title'><b>Rondo of Blood Remake</b></div><p>Rondo of Blood is a lot like Castlevania meets Super Mario Brothers.  There are secrets passageways, secret items, bonus all over each level in the game.  Rondo of Blood is very nostalgic-rich with several levels going through familiar territory as seen in Castlevania 2 and 3.  It is a Castlevania fans haven, which begs the question why it never came over in the first place?</p><p>Rondo of Blood was originally released on the PC-Engine (Turbo Graphix in the US).  Was it really such a risk to bring it over to the states even though Nintendo and Sega was beating the shit out of it?  What little ground they could have gained would have still given Americans one of the best Castlevanias ever made.  meh..  but whatever.</p><p>Rondo of Blood was also known as Dracula X and had a direct sequel, Dracula XX made or ported to the Super Nintendo.  Konami packaged the sequel as the original Dracula X when they released it here..  Dracula XX was a poor rendition of what made Dracula X so fantastic.  Where Dracula X was challenging, mysterious and interesting, Dracula XX made it difficult by throwing hordes of enemies at you, stripped away secrets, and spewed out a derivative version of the story.  But again.. whatever.</p><p>You play as Richter Belmont whose beloved Annette has been kidnapped by a servant of Dracula, Shaft.  Through each level you tear through the monsters through Dracula's castle to rescue her.  Along the way, you may uncover other maidens who've been kidnapped as well.  One such girl is Maria who has magical powers.  You can switch back and forth between Maria and Richter to topple Dracula.</p><p>Two of the biggest secrets in the game are unlocking the original PC-Engine version of Rondo of Blood, and a Playstation version of Symphony of the Night with Maria playable and faster loading times.  It's really not difficult to find these two at all..  despite the fact I had a little help from Gamefaqs.</p><p>Both are easy to find, but for Symphony, you might need a little direction on how to reach it.  Symphony of the Night can be found in Stage 3' (that's 3 with a tick mark behind it), and Rondo of Blood can be in Stage 4' (4 tick).  <b>As a rule of thumb</b>, if you're looking for any secrets in this game be sure to swipe at every part of every wall and throw axes at odd parts of the ceiling.</p><p>There's another third less-publicized unlockable game that's a bit more difficult to get to.  This one is Chi no Rondo no Blood, which was originally available when you put a PC-Engine cartridge in the console when trying to play Rondo of Blood, which was CD.  I just pulled that explanation out of my ass, so that might be how you unlocked it.  It reminds me of playing those Extra stages with Sonic & Knuckles when you put a non-Sonic game in the top slot.  To unlock Chi no Rondo, you have to play through the Boss Rush 3 times.. or something like that.</p><div class='title'><b>Symphony of the Night</b></div><p>Castlevania Symphony of the Night is one of the few games I wish I had played back in the day.  But I cared too much about squaresoft and rpgs at the time to care.  I was able to catch up with it when I started playing Aria of Sorrow on the Gameboy Advance back in 2003 or 2004.  I found a copy at Game Crazy and after experiencing Castlevania under Igarashi's reign..  I was hooked.</p><p>Symphony of the Night was when Igarashi took over the Castlevania series wasn't it?  Or was it Rondo of Blood?  I think Rondo of Blood may have been the first game to take the new subtitle naming scheme for each new Castlevania, even though it didn't back standard until they found their home on the portables.</p><p>When I first played through Symphony of the Night, I suddenly saw why people loved this game and why people regarded this as the greatest Castlevania.  Before that point, I didn't know that Castlevania turned into Metroid.  The music was fantastic and 2D graphics were beautiful...  It was great.  Flipping the castle upside down turned my world upside down too..</p><p>My next run-in with Symphony of the Night was in Japan about a year ago now when I found a pristine NEW copy of the Saturn version for $50.  Oh god, that version is a train-wreck.  Opening up the menu requires LOADING.  Whenever the track changes, there's 5 seconds of LOADING.  Everything fucking LOADS..  ugh.  Eventually I got stuck in the game, came back to the states, and never really touched my saturn again..</p><p>But these days are amazing with the unlockable copy on the PSP.  It sounds great through headphones, loading times are VERY fast, and you get a couple extras migrated from the Saturn version.  This is the definite copy of Symphony of the Night, so forget about Xbox Live or PSN..  Buy this reported copy of it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/draculax.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/draculax.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/draculax.webp" /></p><p><b>Perspective</b>Playing Rondo of Blood before unlocking Symphony of the Night, puts Symphony in a whole new perspective.  That scene portreyed at the beginning of Symphony..  when you are Richter fighting Dracula..  that is the end of Rondo of Blood.  After you exhaust every secret and facet of Rondo, the story continues beautifully with the next installment.</p><p>You have the two greatest and most significant Castlevanias in Castlevania history, back to back.  Once you are done with one amazing experience, you have the next.  Two classics, Two briliant video game masterpieces..</p><p>This is my definitive game on the PSP, despite being a remake and compilation, even though all the best PSP games are either remakes or compilations (or rhythm games).  Out of the 20-so PSP games on my shelf, this one stands tall against the others.  I would fully recommend this game to any fan of video games.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect Achievements" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-achievements">Mass Effect Achievements</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 18, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mass Effect has a total of 45 achievements that can all be yours if you play through the game a minimum of 3 times, but even then you might screw yourself out of an achievement because you didn't do something you thought you were supposed to do.  Mass Effect has a lot of moments like that..</p><p>Because of the decisions I made, I need to play through Mass Effect a minimum of 4 times to gain all the achievements now...  I just completed it for the second time, so that leaves 2 more to go!</p><div class='title'><b>Counter Based Achievements</b></div><p>24 of these achievements I would class as counters..  Do this or collect this a certain amount of times and you get the achievement.</p><div class='title'><b>Kill things this many times (2 achievements)</b></div><p>A couple of these you'll easily get on your own.. like 250 synthetic kills, 150 organic kills..  I think i'd be more difficult if you completed the game killing less than 250 synthetics.</p><div class='title'><b>Use your weapon or heal 150 times (5 achievements)</b></div><p>There are 4 achievements for killing an enemy 150 with each type of gun.  These are pretty easy too.  Once you get one achievement, start using a different weapon.  There's an achievement for using 150 medi-gels..  Not too tough..  Just lead your cohorts into the line of fire and then heal them afterward.  As you continue through the game, you'll get it in no time.</p><div class='title'><b>Alignment (2 achievements)</b></div><p>These are 2 achievements for alignment.  If you reach 75% paragon, you get an achievement and the same with renegade.  Gamefaqs has a few glitches to earn infinite paragon and infinite renegade, but I couldn't get them to work.  It's pretty easy to tell which conversation options will get your paragon and renegade, but throughout the game there isn't enough to get both achievements in one play through.  You'll need to get one on the first playthrough, one on the second.  If you're achievement-whoring this game, this is no big deal.</p><div class='title'><b>Do something 75 times (11 achievements)</b></div><p>The real pain are those pesky "use this ability 75 times" achievements of which they are 11 for a mere 15 points each.  It's pretty easy to get in the habit of using your abilities, but those Tech abilities are not too useful in battle.  I really don't know what the point of these achievements are..  What do we really achieve by using these abilities 75 times?  If anybody has more than 6 or 7 of these achievements, you can tell they have a lot of time on their hands..  They take absolutely no skill to achieve..  Just time and consistency.</p><p>I have no idea if you get the achievement if instruct your party member to do the ability the 75 times, or if your character has to be the one to do it. I will probably test this out in my third playthrough.</p><div class='title'><b>One million Dollars (1 achievement)</b></div><p>Lets see..  2, 6, 7, 9, 20.. one of the remaining 4 is getting 1,000,000 space credits.  This is not a challenge what-so-ever.  Just be an item-whore, which is standard for RPGs (getting all items everywhere), and selling off the ones you don't need.  You'll reach 1,000,000 way before the end of your first play through.  In fact, it didn't take too long in my second playthrough to hit the max of 99,999,999 credits and 999 omni-gels.</p><div class='title'><b>Level 50 & 60 (2 achievements)</b></div><p>Another 2 counter-based achievements are for experience.  You get an achievements when you reach level 50 and level 60.  You should be able to hit level 50 in your first playthrough if you do absolutely everything.  <b>Hint: You gain twice the amount of experience if you kill enemies outside of your lunar rover.</b>  Well, more accurately, killing things with the lunar rover will cut the gained experience more than half..  At the end of my first play through, I was 6,000 xp away from level 50.</p><p>Getting to level 60 is a royal pain.  You need 860,000 experience points to get level 60 and at the end of my second playthrough on New Game+, I ended around 750,000..  So i'll need to do another New Game+ with the same character i've been playing for 50 hours now to hit the 60th level.</p><p>You need to complete one playthrough before unlocking levels 51 through 60.</p><div class='title'><b>Scholar (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The final collection-based achievement is "Scholar", which is finding all the main Codec entries for the main alien races of the Mass Effect Universe.</p><p>You can get this achievement before you leave the citadel the first time, but you can screw yourself by not asking the right questions..  Before Eden Prime, ask Captain Anderson about the Protheans, and right after Eden Prime, ask Anderson about the Geth.  Those are the only two entries you can miss.  The other ones you can get by talking with Avina terminals, the Hanar in the Presidium Emporium, the Elcor in his embassy and the Volus dude in the Elcor embassy.  Once you're a spectre, talk to Anderson about the Batarians.  That should do it.</p><p>There's a full list in this faq: <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960</a>.  Search for [SCH].</p><div class='title'><b>Progression Based Achievements</b></div><p>17 of Mass Effects' achievements I would consider progression based...  meaning, you get an achievement when you beat a level or progress through the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Beat the game (7 achievements), Do Stuff (2 achievements)</b></div><p>You cannot beat the game without getting 7 of these, but the other 3 are more sidequest related.  "Completing the game a second time" and "Landing on an Uncharted world" are self explanatory.</p><div class='title'><b>Fuck a party member (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The one side-quest achievement I missed on my first playthrough was the romantic subplot, which is pretty easy to get..  I was looking in the wrong place.  Just like real life.. :/</p><p>The romantic subplot involves you (the main charcter) and one of two party members.  If you're male, you can get it on with Ashley or Liara.  If you're female, you can sex up Kaidan or Liara.  Be sure to talk with the teammate you're hot for after each main mission, and you'll be in bed with them right before or after Ilos.</p><div class='title'><b>Complete the Majority of the game (7 achievement)</b></div><p>Completing 75% of the primary assignments and 75% of the secondary assignments will net you the main achievement, but there are 6 other achievements for each party member.  You must have them in your party at the time of completing that quest for it to count.  So be prepared for the Long haul.</p><p>Getting the achievement for Ashley and Kaidan is quite easy since you have them in your party from the start.  You get Garrus in your party pretty early too.  Wrex and Tali aren't too bad, but you'll need to put them in your party right away and never switch them out.</p><p>Liara is the most difficult to achieve.  You'll need to ignore all the sidequests in the citadel and go to Artemis Tau immediately after becoming a Spectre.  Once completed, head back to the citadel and complete all those sidequests are go from there.</p><p>I really had no idea how to get these achievements, so after two playthroughs, I only have 3 out of 6.  On my next playthrough, I'll probably go for Wrex and Liara since I've been playing with the same people for both games and I need a break.</p><div class='title'><b>Skill Based Achievements</b></div><p>There are 4 achievements that require actual skill.</p><div class='title'><b>Beat the game on this difficulty (2 achievements)</b></div><p>"Complete Mass Effect on Hard" and "Complete Mass Effect on <em>Insane</em>".  The gamefaqs guide says to get these achievements you must select your difficulty in the options before you start a new game.  However, I was able to get the Hardcore achievement by switching my game from Normal to Hard as soon as was able to after starting a New Game +.</p><div class='title'><b>Tactician (1 achievement)</b></div><p>I got this one without any trouble, so you probably don't need to worry about it.  I'm guessing the description is self explanatory:  The total amount of damage you sustain will be absorbed by your shields MORE than one your person.</p><div class='title'><b>Charismatic (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The description reads "resolve an impossible situation with charm or intimidation".  Basically, level up your charm or intimidation based on your alignment and there are 2 instances I know of where you must choose all the charm or all the intimidation conversation options.  These 2 times are: on Virmire when Wrex gets all pissed off about killing Krogan, and at the end of the game when you face Saren.</p><div class='title'><b>My own progression</b></div><p>Personally, I have 29 out of these 45 achievements.  I like playing Mass Effect quite a bit so I'll probably go through at least once more, but some of these achievements are really a waste of time.  I just need to reach level 60 with my current character, then i'll start over with a male character and a new class finally.</p><p>Also, I think my addition is off a little bit on the above numbers..</p><p>Sources have been <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960">this Gamefaq</a>, Gamefaqs in general, and personal experience.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 &quot;Fall&quot; Update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-fall-update">Xbox 360 "Fall" Update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It does 2 things that I really like: faster window shades and daily updates.</p><p>Moving from window to window in the console overhead is around 2 times faster after the update. You can actually accomplish things rather quickly, rather than having a second lag for the animation. If someone sends me a message, I can run into the console and view it lickidity split. I wonder if the second or two lag from before was because of some query process, or if it was the speed of the animation.</p><p>The daily updates are great too. Now you can actually see what has been added to Xbox Live since you've been gone. It flashes, too, to indicate something new has been added since the last time you connected. There's so much stuff being added online that everyday it flashes with an update. Far more frequent than the Wii.</p><p>You can also stream divx too, but I haven't messed around with that yet. Good Stuff overall. It makes managing the 360 stuff much faster and easier. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mail Call - Katamari PSP Case" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mail-call-katamari-psp-case">Mail Call - Katamari PSP Case</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been trying to get a hold of one of these things for months now.  It looks kinda big though... and crappy :/</p><p>I mean.. look inside of this thing:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" /></p><p>There's nothing at all..  no padding, no soft inards, no nothing to keep it from scratching up my screen either.. what a rip.</p><p>It is rather big though.. let's compare it to the standard Sony PSP sleeve.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" /></p><p>Christ.. this case is big, it wasn't my eyes playing tricks ...

Let's give him some breathing room.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0957.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0957.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0957.webp" /></p><p>There we go...</p><div class='title'><b>eBay Background</b></div><p>Finally, I got my hands on this stupid thing.  I've been trying to buy one of these cases off ebay ever since I first bought my PSP, but things had always gone wrong when trying to secure the highest bid.</p><p>The first couple times I just bid for it and then never checked up on it, thus lost the auction when someone swooped in at the end at sniped the auction from underneath me.  I didn't think the Katamari case was that sought after but FINE.  If that's the way you want to play it, then I guess we'll need to play the ebay sniping game.  I've sniped auctions before and its not that tough.</p><p>Well it is that tough when you aren't paying attention.  Each subsequent auction I put on my view list, I completely forgot about the time it ended.  Most of them ended on the weekend, so when I got to work Monday morning, there would be an email in my inbox, "An ending on your watch list is ending soon"..  Though, it would've already been ended at this point.</p><p>There were a few times I was this close to winning but I still got away from me.  One such instance happened a couple Mondays ago, when the auction ended at 7:30p and I totally remembered.  I wrote a reminder on my hand, remembered!, and perched myself in front of the computer on ebay hitting the F5 button.  I was pysched!</p><p>I kept hitting F5, 10 minutes remain..  F5, 7 minutes remaining..  "Oh, I could bid.. but there's always that slight chance someone will snipe my snipe.."  F5, 4 minutes remaining..  oh, so very close..  I'll wait until 1 minute and do it.  F5, 2 minutes remaining..  F5..  server cannot be found.  WHat?!?!  F5, F5, F5..  server cannot be found.  GODDAMN ROUTER!  Thankfully the episode of Heroes that night was one of the best I've seen, so I got over it pretty quick.</p><p>So I missed that one too..  But, eventually I preveiled and got my case. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Item Background</b></div><p>Originally this was the pre-order bonus for Me and My Katamari in Japan.  I don't think they ever brought this pre-order bonus to America when it was released in March 2006?  Was that when it came out?  We love Katamari was 2005, so it had to be 2006 sometime..  maybe May-ish 2006.</p><p>Anyways and Unfortunately, Me and My Katamari is absolutey horrible.  The game setup isn't too bad, you float around on islands and rebuilds islands in the ocean.  Pocket-sized goals for a pocket-sized katamari..</p><p>The gameplay is what kills this game.  Katamari requires 2 analog sticks, and the PSP has one.  I guess they thought using the D-pad and buttons would be a good substitute for analog sticks, but they are dead wrong.  I would love to play this game, if i could hook up a ps2 controller to my psp.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Anywho..  horrible game.  pretty crappy bonus.  Thankfully, it can hold the PSP and the PSP sleeve in the case, so it's not all bad.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-impressions">Mass Effect Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, when arriving home from work, a package from Gamestop lie at my doorstep and inside was my #1 anticipated game of this Christmas season.. <b>Mass Effect</b>.  I purchased the limited edition version, which is only available online.</p><p>I probably should've bought it from amazon, rather than the price gouging money grubbing monolith Gamestop, but I'm actually satisfied that they got me the game before the thanksgiving day weekend.  I was scheduled to get the game on Monday, but it's here today ^_^.  I can't complain about that.</p><div class='title'><b>Goodies</b></div><p>Anywho.. here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" /></p><p>Lots and lots of Mass Effect goodness.  I got the pre-order bonus with it as well, so overall I have 1) the game, 2) 2 bonus discs with extra content, 3) an art book with pretty concept art (unlike the crappy halo 3 artbook), 4) a log book with background and information on the worlds and aliens of Mass Effect, and 5) a crappy tin box to hold everything in.  This crappy tin is far better than the Halo 3, so it's not all bad.  I'm still keeping my game in the pre-order box for easy access, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Character creation</b></div><p>When beginning Mass Effect, you have the choice of playing John Shepard, or creating your own character.  I created a custom male character and began playing the game, but I could not continue.  My dude looked like a chump..  How am I supposed to care about some guy I'd run into at a bar?  I scrapped that game and began anew with a female lead..</p><p>The character is much more solid compared to Oblivion.  The controls and customization are so loose in Oblivion, you really have to work on a character to not be Ugly.  Even the random generated characters look like crap.  Not so with Mass Effect..  You really have to work on a character to make them Ugly.</p><p>The characters look really nice, but all the guys look rather plain.  I would rather play as John Shepard, than a custom male character.  The female custom characters are pretty hot though..  The character I ended up creating looks like a young badass Captain Janeway.</p><p>Before you mess with looks, you have to choose your character's past.  You have 3 choices for childhood, and 3 choices from military past.  For childhood you can be an Earther, living on the streets, running tricks, and joining the military as a last resort (much like Captain Tylor), a Colonist, whose home was destroyed by an invading alien race (kinda like the dude in Nadesico), or Military, both parents alive and raised you while serving (kinda like every macross character).</p><p>Your 3 choices from military past are Sole Survivor, where you were the sole survivor of a failed mission, War Hero, where you have battled and lead your team victoriously, or Ruthless, where you'll win a battle at any cost.</p><p>You also choose your ailments, where it be all out gunplay, techplay or magic, or a combination of two.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>When you're out on a mission, you are shooting up evil aliens in Gears of War / Rainbox Six style.  Third person shooting and killing while commanding your team to do certain things.. like heal or attack.  Much like KOTOR, you have a party of 3.</p><p>It's pretty fun so far, but I REALLY miss the melee attack from Halo 3.  The melee attack really is the last line of defense between you and your enemy and being forced to shoot an enemy at point blank range seems unnatural now.</p><p>Oh well, I'm not supposed to let enemies that close anyways..</p><p>blah blah .. what else can I really say about the gameplay.  It's a third person shooter.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Anyways, so far, after 1 hour, the game is pretty amazing.  It's already building up its massive political story, so it should be a great time sinker.  Check it out.</p><p>Mario is also a great time sinker, but in a much different way.  The generation gap is what sets these two apart, but they are perfect examples of their genres.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/18">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/16">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
