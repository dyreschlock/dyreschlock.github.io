The revenue generated from their booth at PAX directly funds their upcoming games.  It's win/win.</p><div class='title'><b>Castle Crashers</b></div><p>Last year, having just released Castle Crashers, their merchandise was almost all focused on Castle Crashers.  They were selling shirts, figures, and the game.  I bought the full game from them last year that came with a fancy pewter medallion and a code for the game.  It was certainly more tangible that simply buying it through Xbox live.</p><p>Castle Crashers was definitely my favorite downloadable game last year.  After buying the game at PAX 08, we played it so much that I missed my flight home!  <a href="/old/v7/pax-castle-crashers" title="/pax-castle-crashers">Read all about it</a>.  This year I continued my patronage and purchased a statue of my favorite Castle Crashers character (for sale): The Red Knight.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4930.webp"  /></p><p>Steam Knight is actually my favorite, but they haven't made a figure for him.  Dan Paladin was at the Behemoth booth, so I asking him if he would sign my spiffy figure.  And he did!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4860.webp"  /></p><p>Also, there was a Castle Crashers cosplayer at the booth.  I'm pretty sure it was one of their friends or wives and not just a random fan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_behemoth/IMG_4905.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Game 3</b></div><p>The Behemoth booth had 4 stations setup.  One had PS3 Castle Crashers, and the other one had Game 3 setup on the Xbox.  I gave it a try and it seems like it might be fun.</p><p>Each game developed by Behemoth has been in a different genre, mostly in the retro realm.  Alien Hominid was a 2D sidescrolling shooter, ala Contra or Metal Slug.  Castle Crashers was a brawler ala Final Fight and TMNT.  But, Game 3 doesn't fall into a specific genre.</p><p>It's very much a multiplayer action game.  Again, it seems like it'll be fun, but I didn't really have that much fun with it at PAX.  The game mode we played had a floating whale that gave out coins.  You pick up as many coins at possible and deposit them in a floating bank.  The opposing team can knock you out and steal your coins, so be careful!  It was simple, and didn't have much more to it other than jumping around.</p><p>I love the art, though.  You can choose your head, face and weapon.  The faces range from stern to excited to intense.  The weapons can be defensive or offensive.  I played with a fan, which repeled most projectile weapons.</p><p>The Behemoth's Development Video #1 shows exactly how the game is played.  I didn't get much more out of the game having already seen this video.  Check it out: <a href="http://devblog.thebehemoth.com/?p=1628" title="http://devblog.thebehemoth.com/?p=1628">http://devblog.thebehemoth.com/?p=1628</a></p><div class='title'><b>Release</b></div><p>Game 3 has only been announced, and has no release date, or even a name, yet.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Mass Effect 2 Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-mass-effect-2-hands-on">PAX 09: Mass Effect 2 Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mass Effect has been the only RPG in recent years that actually hooked me.  Fallout 3 I found boring and dismal.  Fable II was ugly and too ridiculous.  JRPGs (except Final Fantasy XII) haven't had a unique or different story for quite a while.  But Mass Effect was a little different.  It was a fully realized NEW Sci Fi universe, much like Star Trek, Star Wars, Babylon 5, etc, etc.</p><p>There are very few games that create an in-depth detailed universe for their game that aren't in the MMO space.  There are even less that have a decent story that unravels through a decent plot and utilizes many aspects of that lore.  There's a lot of lore fluff that doesn't matter for the story of Jonathon Shepherd, but I find myself more interested in reading about these alien races, than some ancient Orcs v. Human battle in the WOW lore.  I think alien races have always intrigued me because they are so different from us, but still have the capacity for intelligence.</p><p>I'm quite excited for the sequel, so I was glad to get the chance to check it out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4906.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>One thing that was goofy about Mass Effect 1 were the dialogue scenes.  The dialogue wasn't goofy, but the way in which it presented always had a profile shot of who was talking.  That was the only shot they ever used, and it got boring fast.</p><p>The dialogue in Mass Effect 2 has a lot going on in the background.  The shots are more dynamic and have more interaction that just conversation.  For example: At the beginning of the demo, you hold a conversation in a car while flying to your destination.  The only interaction you have is conversation, but the shots change from a close-up in-car to a wide shot of the city's traffic, to a closer shot outside the car with character visible through the windows.  It's a varied and shows off how beautiful the environments are.  It's far more interesting that two people standing side-by-side holding a conversation.</p><p>The conversations towards the end of the demo has a whole lot of body movement and gestures that really enhance the actually dialogue.  It's like an actual movie now!</p><div class='title'><b>Dialogue</b></div><p>Another "gamey" thing about the dialogue that has been altered is that the conversation choices are not so black and white.  After a while of playing Mass Effect 1, you'll realize that the 3 conversation choices on the right go in order of Good, Neutral, and Evil.  If you want to be good in the game, you'll most likely always say the top choice.  For evil, the bottom choice.  Why ever choose the middle?</p><p>It wasn't so easy to tell if the top choice was actually the "Good" choice towards the end of the demo.  In fact, choosing the top choice invoked a battle that I found out could have been avoided.  Maybe it was the Good choice and I appeared weak?</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4907.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Other Thoughts</b></div><p>The demo was very very pretty.  It was pretty dark, but featured a rich color palette the made areas look very dynamic and cool.  A very Sci Fi style that is much more prevalent than the first game.  It looks great. ^_^</p><p>The action sequence also felt much different than Mass Effect 1.  I actually needed precision and strategy when fighting all the enemies, rather than blowing them all away with my sniper rifle or using my team as decoys.  It was kinda difficult.  I should've checked which class I was playing.</p><p>But overall, the game is pretty sweet.  It takes what made the original special and takes it to the next level and other box quotes.</p><p>Mass Effect 2 releases for Xbox 360 and PC in "Early 2010".</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_masseffect/IMG_4908.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Star Wars Old Republic Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-star-wars-the-old-republic-impressions">PAX 09: Star Wars Old Republic Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Sunday morning, instead of standing in line to view the exhibition hall for the 3rd day in a row, Five and I lined up for The Old Republic demonstration.  This was the second demo of The Old Republic at PAX this year.  We didn't go to the Saturday demo because we figured it would be too crowded and didn't want to stand in line forever.  Sunday was much more laid back.</p><p>During the Saturday demo, Bioware announced the release of Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic on Steam.  The also announced that everyone watching the demo will receive a full copy of the game!  This was also true for the Sunday crowd!  So, it's installing on my computer right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Star Wars The Old Republic is a story-driven MMORPG.  Every MMO these days has a story but no one gives a shit.  When I talked with NPCs in World of Warcraft, I just clicked through the conversation and didn't read a single thing.  Who cares, really?  What they say might be interesting, but it's all text and presented in a way that I don't care a single bit.  Especially when my friends have already started running down the trail, and I can't read that fast.</p><p>But it's not important for how the game is played.  What that NPC says bears no difference and how I kill the enemies he wants me to.  He should just say, "go to this dungeon and kill this boss."</p><p>Bioware says the story in an RPG is key and it should be no different for MMORPGs.  This sounds incredibly ambitious, since it has never happened before.  It also ambitious to make an MMO period, because World of Warcraft owns that space.  Why compete with the most successful MMO in history?</p><div class='title'><b>Online</b></div><p>Because they aren't.  In fact, thinking of The Old Republic in terms of an MMO skews the basic perception of this game.  The reason story will work in The Old Republic is because it's an RPG first.</p><p>They've basically made a single player RPG with the core focus of story and conversation in all Bioware games, but made it multiplayer.  Instead of making a party of NPCs, those NPCs are now your friends or other player characters.  And Instead of one party member hosting the game, it's all on a single server that everyone plays on.</p><p>You'll run into everyone else playing through their story.  And since The Old Republic has many branching story paths and a morality system you are judged by, the world and story will be shaped by the things that you do and things that people you play with do.  So, it'll be different (to a degree) for everyone.</p><p><b>The Old Republic is really just KOTOR Online</b>, but everyone is playing it at once.  Plus there's PVP and an economy and item crafting.  All the fun of an MMORPG has been squished into the KOTOR universe.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Thinking of The Old Republic is those terms makes me think that it will succeed in its promise to bring story to an MMO.  Because they're actually just bringing the MMO space to a story, which is the right way to approach it.  I was intrigued with the idea to begin with, but now I'm all for it.  I definitely plan on giving The Old Republic a try. ^_^</p><p>The Old Republic is schedule for release in 2010 on the PC.  Hopefully, my computer can play it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_starwars/IMG_4868.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Heavy Rain Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-heavy-rain-hands-on">PAX 09: Heavy Rain Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I was really surprised to see Heavy Rain at PAX.  There hasn't been a lot of trailers or press releases over the past 2 or 3 years.  We've really only seen bits and pieces other than what the gaming press writes about after seeing a demo.  Even then, there haven't been many press demos of the game either.  Was Heavy Rain even at E3 this year?</p><p>I'm really intrigued by Heavy Rain because it's different.  It's not an FPS, it's not an adventure game.  It's an interactive movie, really.  It is a lot like Dragon's Lair or Space Ace from the early 90s.  It is entirely played by quick time events and conversation choices.  Though, you can move about the environment when given the opportunity.  I guess, you could call it the modern day adaptation of an old Lucas Arts or Sierra adventure game.</p><div class='title'><b>Demo</b></div><p>The PAX Demo (which was labeled GDC demo) put you in a convenience store.  You're trying to get information from the store clerk.  You could probably get the information with the correct conversation sequence, but I never saw anyone complete it.  After you piss him off, you go to the back to get an inhaler, when a perp busts in the door and holds up the clerk at gun point.  He doesn't notice you in the back.</p><p>You can carefully creep up behind him and knock him over the head with a frying pan or a bottle of whiskey, but there are several Quick Time Events to blow your approach.  I didn't see anyone successfully reach the perp without him noticing.  You need to put your hands in the air or else he'll shoot!  And then you go through a conversation sequence that will make him leave.  I didn't see anyone do that successfully.</p><p>Each time you say something, you'll inch close enough.  So, after you talk with him for a while, you'll be close enough to start fighting him.  Press X here, Shake the controller there, and you've knocked him out!  You gain the clerk's trust and get the information you wanted.  Taa-daa~!</p><p>When I played, I fucked up when approaching the perp.  I wasn't about the put my hands up, so I kept them down.  And the perp shot me through the shoulder.  He ran out the door after that, and that gained the clerks trust.  I would really like to see the other outcomes that were available, but most people screwed up and did the same thing over and over again, so it was boring after the 5th time.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Heavy Rain is a very beautiful looking game.  The only environment from the demo was the convenience store, but it had an incredible amount of detail.  Everything on the shelves had individual labels.  The few ceiling lights cast very dark shadows in the dimly lit store.  It was very rich.  I can't wait to see what the rest of the game looks like. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090905_heavyrain/IMG_4861.webp"  /></p><p>The demo did not turn me off one bit.  In fact, after playing the demo for Heavy Rain I'm more excited than ever to play this game.  I can't wait. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Release</b></div><p>Heavy Rain is only available for Playstation 3 and should be released "Early 2010", just like everything else that was supposed to come out this year.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX 09: Dead Space Extraction Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-09-dead-space-extraction-hands-on">PAX 09: Dead Space Extraction Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 8, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There weren't many games in fall 08 that lived up to the hype, except Dead Space.  After playing <a href="/old/v7/pax-dead-space-hands-on" title="/pax-dead-space-hands-on">Dead Space at PAX 08</a>, I was sold.  Dead Space had a very rich atmosphere compiled by an organic sci-fi environment and detailed distinct sharp sound quality.  My hype was vindicated when I played through the game in one sitting.</p><p>Dead Space Extraction is the complete opposite of everything that made the original so fantastic.  It's not an adventure game at all; it's an on-rails action game.  The brilliance of Dead Space was suspense.  Because the player had complete control over the movement of the main character, Isaac, you controlled the suspense.  The player could slow down if the suspense was too much, or take on the situation without thinking twice.</p><p>All of that is completely removed from Dead Space Extraction because you are not in control.  You just shoot monsters when the pop out of walls and run at you.  There's absolutely no suspense, so why even bother.  Dead Space Extraction does not nothing to differentiate itself from House of the Dead, or any other on-rails shooters.  Shoot, Reload, Pick up Ammo, Repeat, Fight Boss.  I'm not even sure I would like it even if I wasn't such a fan of the first game.</p><p>Extraction shouldn't even be considered as the "next" Dead Space game.  It's just a set piece for providing background story in the overall Dead Space universe.  I don't think many people really care about that.  And your standard Wii owner is definitely not going to care about it.<br/>____</p><p>Dead Space Extraction releases on the Wii sometime this fall.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: Falcom Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-falcom-edition">Games I buy: Falcom Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Plenty of young people thanks to UW Madison.  The school brings a decent foreign Asian population, too.  Plus, Madison isn't that big, so we're all able to connect in many ways.</p><p>One of these tiny ways is Half-Priced Books, a used bookstore that buys and sells books and almost all forms of media.  Visiting one of these stores and seeing what they have available is one of the best ways a community or region reveals its interests.  I've found old Squaresoft games, Kurt Vonnegut novels, Communications of ACM magazines, bizarre Anime and plenty of other stuff.</p><p>Today, I came scross something pretty unique.  It looks like some Japanese nerd decided to sell his collection of Falcom games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp"  /></p><p>Every now and then I'll come across Japanese games in Madison used stores, but Falcom games?  Falcom games are usually only purchased by the nerdiest of hardcore J-RPG fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Nihon Falcom</b></div><p>Falcom is a pretty bizarre game company.  You may know them best as the developer of the Y's franchise, which first premiered in America on the Super Nintendo.  That's the first I had ever heard of them, until <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908">Retronauts</a> did an episode on Falcom earlier this year.  (episode 66)</p><p>They are a successful Japanese PC Game development studio that hasn't done a single Porn game.  Actually, one of their first games, Joshidaisei Private Stripper, sounds like a porn game, but that's the only one!  Their success has been built from their JRPG franchises: Dragon Slayer / Xanadu, Y's, Sorcerian, Legend of Heroes, Brandish.</p><p>Also, even though you can find many of their games on the popular console platforms, Falcom is not responsible for any of their ports except for the PSP.  They contract other development studios to do them.  It's pretty funny listening to the Retronauts crew attempt to list all the companies that have ported a Falcom game to another platform.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Gurumin</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp"  /></p><p>I've only ever played one Falcom game through to completion and that's Gurumin.  One of those games at Half-Priced Books was the original PC version of the game!</p><p>Gurumin is a cute action-RPG in which you play as Palin.  Palin is new to a quiet mining town and becomes lonely with the lack of children.  She does find a friend, but it turns out her new friend is a monster.  A good monster, though.  Their monster town has been ripped apart by other monsters and some even kidnapped.  Palin to the rescue!</p><p>It's a fantastic game with cute characters, cute dialogue, and throw-back PS1 era graphics.  It would be an amazing game if it weren't for the annoying single analog stick controls.  After spending time with Gurumin a couple years ago, I wrote a little bit about it on <a href="/old/v7/psp-gurumin-impressions" title="/psp-gurumin-impressions">October 17th, 2007</a>.  Please get past the horrible writing.</p><div class='title'><b>Purchase</b></div><p>Of the 7 Falcom games at Half-Priced Books, I picked up the 3 chapters of Legend of Heroes and Y's Origin.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp"  /></p><p>After re-reading my Gurumin Impression from 2 years ago, I think I might pick up that one too.  I bet Gurumin PC looks and plays worlds better than the PSP version.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to In the Army Now, with Atlus?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/in-the-army-now-with-atlus">In the Army Now, with Atlus?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

They carry clothes, toys, movies and, of course, video games.  In fact, the PX is a gold mine for video games.  The PX has many games that time forgot.  And since the general populous cannot shop at the PX, it keeps the riff-raff out and the supply high.</p><p>What's really weird is the huge surplus of games published by Atlus.  Atlus is a North American publisher that spends a lot of time and attention on presentation and limited edition releases of their games.  They generally publish a lot of RPGs, including their own super-popular RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei.  SMT has been getting a lot of buzz over here thanks to Persona.</p><p>This <b>surplus</b> includes recent releases, such as Dark Spire, Knights of the Nightmare, Devil Summoner 2, Hammerin' Hero, Crimson Gem Saga...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4294.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4296.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4296.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4296.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4300.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4300.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4300.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4304.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4306.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4306.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4306.webp"  /></p><p>Some not-so recent releases, such as Super Robot Taisen, Legacy of Y's, Arcana Heart..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4297.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4297.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4297.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4298.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4298.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4307.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4307.webp"  /></p><p>And some releases from a while ago that are actually difficult to find...  such as Stella Deus, Digital Devil Saga 2, Persona 3 LE, and Growlanser Heritage of War.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4301.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4301.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4301.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4302.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4299.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4299.webp"  /></p><p>Actually, I think it's pretty amazing they have these old games there, especially Digital Devil Saga 2.  I would buy every single one of these games, except the PX sells them for MSRP.  Every PS2 game is $50, every PSP game $40, and every NDS game $35.  It's a treasure trove, but at a cost!</p><p>So that's probably why they still have so many copies of these games.  Why buy a $50 PS2 game that full of pussy Japanese bullshit, when I can buy a badass FPS for the Xbox 360 for only $10 more?!  Riddle me that, civilian!</p><p>Anyways, as you can see in these pictures, they don't have just a few copies of these games in stock.  They have a whole bunch of copies.  And it's not just this PX too.  When Justin was stationed in North Carolina, I picked up copies of Devil Summoner 1 and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne.  Both of which are Atlus published (and developed) games.</p><p>I find it really odd that these military posts have such a huge surplus of these games.  And!  That no one on-base buys any of them.  You'd think the rules of Supply and Demand would be enforced here, but they aren't.  The next time I return to Florida to visit Justin, there will be just as many Atlus games as there were on this trip.  It's really odd.</p><p>They need to put all their Atlus titles on sale or clearance or something.  Hopefully when they do, it'll be the same weekend I'm down there.  My half.com store will have a glut of fantastic games, again!</p><div class='title'><b>Not just Atlus</b></div><p>Atlus is the most prominently published games, but there are plenty of other unappreciated titles on those shelves.</p><p>There were copies of Okami, God Hand, Soul Nomad, and Rhapsody.  There were copies of other NIS games, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp"  /></p><p>If you happen to know someone in our Armed Forces, visit them and take a look at the video game stock at their PX.

| June 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm a huge fan of the Ghostbusters.  Like many people my age, I grew up with the movies and Saturday morning TV show.  I used to pretend I was a Ghostbuster, and run around the backyard with my friends busting ghosts.  Recently, I started getting into the <em>spirit</em> of things thanks to hearing the Ghostbusters theme song at every 80s Night @ Inferno.</p><p>So when I first saw that demo-real footage of this game that popped up online out of the blue back in early 2008, I was completely blown away (ign.com).  Not only was it a next-gen Ghostbustin' game, but it looked really really good.  It didn't look like some cobbled together FPS.  It looked very fluid and real.  Amazing.</p><p>Since this footage came out of nowhere, no one seemed to know anything about it.  A couple days later, after the blogs had done all their research, fact finding and scooping, I knew a little bit more about it.  It was slated for a Fall 2008 release, and was developed by Terminal Reality, whose credits were somewhat poor.  Blood Rayne was their only claim to fame.</p><p>But it looked great, and after a shaky delay due to loss of publisher, Atari picked up the Distribution rights and it finally came out June 16th 2009 (20 years after Ghostbusters II premiered in theaters).</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>A couple weeks after that, Gamely finally sent me a copy for the Playstation 3 and so far, I've been having a great time with it.  Ghostbusters is pretty damn fun. ^_^</p><p>Zach and Justin had mentioned how much they were enjoying the game.  They commented that it was like being in a Ghostbusters film.  And I'd have to agree with them so far.  Egon, Ray, Venkman, and Winston are perfect renditions of their original roles.</p><p>I should hope so considering this game was even possible thanks to Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.  They wrote and developed the story and got everyone back to reprise their original roles.  Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are all voices their original characters.  Annie Potts returns as Janine.  William Atherton returns as Walter Peck.  They've also got Brian Doyle-Murray as the Mayor, and Alyssa Milano as the female lead.</p><p>And this cast works fantastic together.  The dialogue and character balance works perfectly together and forms a new, completely unique entry to the Ghostbusters franchise.  This really feels like the "next" Ghostbusters.  In fact, Dan Aykroyd has said in an interview, "This is essentially the third movie."</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>In Ghostbusters, you play as a new recruit.  You don't actually play one of the original Ghostbusters.  (Though, you might in Multiplayer.. I don't know).  Your character rarely ever speaks, and even though you're the one doing the bulk of the Ghostbustin', you really are on the side lines for the story.</p><p>It actually works out perfectly.  This is the <b>first game</b> in which I play the silent "main" character, and feel like I'm totally immersed in the game's story.  Maybe that's because I'm not the main character.  I'm part of an ensemble cast.  They're the real stars and I'm the support.  For the most part, I'm watching them unravel the story, and speak their hilarious lines.</p><p>But, I'm still totally part of their group.  Bustin' Ghosts is completely a team effort.  They'll throw out their traps while I've captured a ghost in my proton stream.  They'll revive me if I'm knocked down.  And I do the same for them.  They're my pals!</p><div class='title'><b>Virtual Monument</b></div><p>Many of the areas in the game are 3D imaginings of places from the movies.  You can walk around the Ghostbuster HQ, you go to the Sedgewick Hotel featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go to the New York Public Library, also featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go the Historical Museum, as featured in Ghostbusters 2.</p><p>You also come across many artifacts from the two movies.  In fact, the painting of Vigo (from Ghostbusters II) is sitting in the garage of the Ghostbuster HQ.  There are tons of references from the original movies, as well as pop culture from the late 80s.</p><p>Taking a virtual tour of these sets reminds me a lot of <b>Lost Via Domus</b>.  In the Lost game, you play a new character and discover the world of Lost for yourself.  You can walk around the hatch, the beach, the pearl station.  You find artifacts like the VW bus, the 2 skeletons.  You follow the river through the Jungle.  The characters are voiced by their actual actors.  I wrote about this back on <a href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus" title="/lost-via-domus">August 24th, 2008</a>.  It's a virtual world.</p><p>Of course, the big difference is that Ghostbusters the game was written and "created" by their original cast and creators.  Lost Via Domus was a simple fan fiction written by huge fans of the show, who happen to work at Ubisoft.</p><div class='title'><b>Perfect Pacing</b></div><p>Ghostbusters is pretty linear, and has some very gamey pacing.  The game is split up into several different missions.  Chapters, really.  Each chapter is about 2 or 3 hours long depending on how much time you waste blowing stuff up, or searching for artifacts.</p><p>In my opinion, 2 to 3 hours is a perfect length for a chapter.  It's just long enough that you can get through a chapter in one sitting. After you finish a chapter, everyone is back at Ghostbusters HQ figuring out what to do next.  It's the perfect point to set down the controls for the next time you get back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Definitely Play this Game!</b></div><p>If you are or were a fan of the Ghostbusters and LOVE nostalgia, you definitely need to play this game.  I would still suggest renting it though as $60 is still quite a price to pay.</p><p>One thing to note, the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions are identical and were the ones written by the original cast. The Wii, Playstation 2, Nintendo DS, and PSP versions were developed by some other developer and are probably utter crap.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to More Metroid Errata" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/more-metroid-errata">More Metroid Errata</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There's a couple other things I'd like to mention concerning Metroid before I drop the subject for a while.  I find it somewhat odd that I've had Metroid on the brain so much since the announcement of Metroid Other M.  I'm a huge Zelda fan, but I guess I never really considered myself that big of a Metroid fan.  I think a lot of that fandom was taken away by Metroid Prime</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b></div><p>I think the Metroid Prime series adds a whole lot of glitz and glamor and takes away from some of the charm and prestige that Metroid garnished on the Super Nintendo.  I thought it was nice that they took it a different direction than Legend of Zelda for the transition to 3D, but it felt empty.  There was no emotion in the game.</p><p>Anyways, I still think Metroid Prime 1 and Metroid Prime 3 are pretty fun games.  And I think what makes Metroid Prime 3 so great is the fluid controls of the Wii-mote.  So far I think it's one of the best designed games on the Wii.</p><p><b>Luckily!</b>, Nintendo is re-hashing many of their Gamecube classics with Wii-mote / Nunchuck "enhanced" controls.  Nintendo has announced that in August, they'll release <b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b>.  A collection of all 3 Metroid Prime games with Wii-controls for a mere $50.</p><p>For those of you who missed Metroid Prime 1 or 2, or who loved the new controls of Metroid Prime 3, this is the perfect opportunity to revisit these games and experience the full "story" arc of the Metroid Prime series.</p><div class='title'><b>The Emotion of Super Metroid</b></div><p>I think what makes Super Metroid so rich are the emotional moments experienced between Samus and her Metroid hatchling.  Samus found the Metroid hatching after traversing the depths of SR388 uncovering a horrible grotesque plot of Metroid mutation.  The Metroid hatching thinks of Samus as her mother, and there are a couple moments where this mother/child relation fosters itself into something few games did at that time.</p><p>2 years ago, Chad Concelmo of Destructriod wrote an article that focused primarily on this aspect of the game in full detail.  It's a great read: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml">The Memory Card .01: The return of Baby Metroid</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid 2 - fan remake</b></div><p>Metroid 2 is probably the most difficult to replay out of any Metroid game.  Released in 1992 for the Game Boy, Metroid II has not been officially re-released since its debut.  Every Metroid game except Metroid 2 can be played on a modern gaming device.  (Unless you discount the DS Lite due to the DSi release)  You'd need to find a Gameboy Advance in order to play Metroid 2.</p><p>Anyways, Project AM2R has been working on a remake of the game to make it more playable for today's generation.</p><p>Here's their most recent trailer:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="505" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="505" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>It looks pretty fantastic. ^_^.  Check 'em out at <a href="http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/" title="http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/">http://metroid2remake.blogpost.com/</a>.</p><p>I wonder how long it'll be before Nintendo shuts them down.</p><div class='title'><b>Metal Metroid</b></div><p>The song in the background of that trailer totally reminds me Metroid Metal.  Metroid Metal is a group of dudes who've repraised many of the songs throughout the Metroid series in the Metal Rock genre.  Their tracks are pretty slick.</p><p>Check 'em out @ <a href="http://metroidmetal.com/" title="http://metroidmetal.com/">Metroid Metal dot Com</a></p><p><b>News!</b>: As you may have noticed from their website, Metroid Metal will be playing Live at the Penny Arcade Expo this year.

| June 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When Metroid Prime was released in 2002, Nintendo finally had their answer to western First Person Shooters.  Golden Eye and Perfect Dark were legends, but NOW! Nintendo had one of their core franchises in the FPS spotlight.  And felt they had something that contended with the Halo crowd on the Xbox.</p><p>Metroid Prime was the first Metroid game since Super Metroid released 8 years prior, so it was a pretty big deal considering the success of Super Metroid.  Nintendo created Retro Studios, an American based developer who jumped at the chance to make this game.  Shigeru Miyamoto and Yoshio Sakamoto were in regular contact to make sure the game was within Nintendo's vision.</p><p>The third dimension worked great for Nintendo and Metroid Prime became the Gamecube's #6 best selling games of all time with 2.7 million units.  2.7 million doesn't sound like a lot, but keep in mind only 21.7 million Gamecubes were sold worldwide.  Over 10% attach rate is not bad.  (Side Note: Super Smash Brothers Melee is the best selling Gamecube game at 6.1 million units sold, which is a little over 25%.)</p><p>2 years later, Retro Studios released Metroid Prime 2 which continued where Metroid Prime 1 left off.  The FPS gameplay had become iconic for the Metroid series and the idea of a 2D side scrolling adventure became more of a treasured memory of Super Metroid.</p><p>Though, <b>those traditional roots have not been forgotten!</b> They've been merely overshadowed by the graphical splendor.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Fusion</b></div><p>Metroid Fusion is the <b>actual sequel to Super Metroid</b>.  In fact, the opening credits say Metroid 4.  I think this game get overlooked because it was <b>released on the exact same day as Metroid Prime</b>.  Gamers were far more interested in the new fresh look on the Gamecube, rather than an outdated gaming experience on the Gameboy Advance.</p><p>Metroid Fusion's development was headed by Yoshio Sakamoto and everyone else who worked on Super Metroid.  Nintendo still wanted a traditional follow-up to Super Metroid, so they did.  And on November 17th, 2002, fans got a traditional sequel with Metroid Fusion and a fresh perspective on the series with Metroid Prime.  But gamers made their choice.  Where Metroid Prime ultimately sold 2.7 million, Metroid Fusion sold just a little over 1 million.  Metroid Prime was the star.</p><p>Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime are interesting entries in the series.  It's interesting in that Metroid Prime had a radically different way to play the game, but the design was incredibly traditional.  It had the familiar look of Samus and all the same items you remembered from Super Metroid.  Metroid Fusion played the exact same way you remembered from Super Metroid, but the story and character designs were quite different than what you remembered.</p><p>Metroid Fusion has a bunch of cutscenes, text and dialogue that progress the story.  There's actual plot!  The environment, characters, and enemies are all <b>very cohesive</b> and build a decent story.  Unfortunately, the game is incredibly linear which is a big negative for a traditional Metroid.  The game opens up once you beat it, but <b>there are power-ups you can miss!</b> What the hell is that crap?!</p><p>Through and though, Metroid Fusion isn't half bad.  <b>If you liked Super Metroid, I'd totally recommend it</b>. ^_^  Now that I know what happens in Metroid Fusion, <b>I'm pretty interested to see how Metroid Other M fits in to the story.</b> Though, as a big fan of Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion was a let down.  It's good, but not Super Metroid good.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Zero Mission</b></div><p>Metroid Prime 1 was pretty sweet and made Metroid Prime 2 just as highly anticipated.  So much so, that you may have overlooked the very fantastic <b>Metroid Zero Mission</b> released 6 months prior.  You may have also overlooked it because it's a remake.  You may have also overlooked it because word of mouth said Metroid Fusion wasn't so great.  You may have overlooked it because it's on the Gameboy Advance and not the Gamecube.  Whatever...</p><p>Metroid Zero Mission is a remake of the first entry in the series, the original 1986 Metroid.  It's nearly identical through and through, but with tighter graphics, faster, more responsive controls, and more weapons than Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion.  Plus, Zero Mission extends the original Plot to fit better into the overall time line of the Metroid series.</p><p><b>Metroid Zero Mission is fantastic</b>.  It is every bit as good as Super Metroid. And it's sad that it's one of the poorest selling titles in the series at around half a million units sold worldwide.</p><p>After finishing Metroid Fusion, I played a little Zero Mission for the first time in a while and it is so smooth.  Metroid Fusion is like a step back.  Half the time, Samus doesn't move how I want her to move.  The same is with going back to Super Metroid.  Those controls are outdated and Metroid Zero Mission is incredibly modern.</p><p>Much like Super Metroid is to the Super Nintendo, Metroid Zero Mission is one of the best games the Gameboy Advance has to offer.  <b>If you're a fan of Super Metroid, you've got to play this game.</b></p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Other M perspective</b></div><p>Playing through these Metroid games only feed my hype for Metroid Other M.  This is the first game that Yoshio Sakamoto has been deeply involved with since Metroid Zero Mission.  But I don't want to get my hopes up too much.</p><p>It seems like Sakamoto's development team can't really handle the 3rd dimension.  Their original Metroid game for Nintendo 64 Disk Drive was scrapped because it was a mess.  Then, Retro Studios picked up the project and basically started completely over.  The same thing was probably going on again with Project M, until they brought in Team Ninja to bring the 3D nature of the game up to quality.</p><p>I really wonder where Metroid 64 fits into the time line.  Did they take the story and recode it as Metroid Fusion?  Or Do you think this story will finally see the light of day as Metroid Other M?  I think it's probably the latter.  I'm guessing that Metroid Other M is the final product of Metroid 64.  Since it's story was probably too big for the Gameboy Advance.  And Sakamoto probably wanted to keep this story close by rather than let Retro take it.</p><p>Anyways, I'm thinking too much into this.  Metroid Other M won't even be released for another year, and all this speculation and conjecture is really only based on the trailer and <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">Jeremy Parish's interview</a>.  It'll really just build it up to something that won't fit my dream.  Who knows, though.  It's fun to be surprised.</p><p>Previous thoughts on Metroid Other M: <a href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m" title="/metroid-other-m">June 3rd</a>.</p><p><b>Anyways, check out Metroid Zero Mission.</b> ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/14">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/12">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
