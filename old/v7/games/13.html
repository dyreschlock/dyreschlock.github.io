After playing <a href="/old/v7/pax-dead-space-hands-on" title="/pax-dead-space-hands-on">Dead Space at PAX 08</a>, I was sold.  Dead Space had a very rich atmosphere compiled by an organic sci-fi environment and detailed distinct sharp sound quality.  My hype was vindicated when I played through the game in one sitting.</p><p>Dead Space Extraction is the complete opposite of everything that made the original so fantastic.  It's not an adventure game at all; it's an on-rails action game.  The brilliance of Dead Space was suspense.  Because the player had complete control over the movement of the main character, Isaac, you controlled the suspense.  The player could slow down if the suspense was too much, or take on the situation without thinking twice.</p><p>All of that is completely removed from Dead Space Extraction because you are not in control.  You just shoot monsters when the pop out of walls and run at you.  There's absolutely no suspense, so why even bother.  Dead Space Extraction does not nothing to differentiate itself from House of the Dead, or any other on-rails shooters.  Shoot, Reload, Pick up Ammo, Repeat, Fight Boss.  I'm not even sure I would like it even if I wasn't such a fan of the first game.</p><p>Extraction shouldn't even be considered as the "next" Dead Space game.  It's just a set piece for providing background story in the overall Dead Space universe.  I don't think many people really care about that.  And your standard Wii owner is definitely not going to care about it.<br/>____</p><p>Dead Space Extraction releases on the Wii sometime this fall.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: Falcom Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-falcom-edition">Games I buy: Falcom Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Plenty of young people thanks to UW Madison.  The school brings a decent foreign Asian population, too.  Plus, Madison isn't that big, so we're all able to connect in many ways.</p><p>One of these tiny ways is Half-Priced Books, a used bookstore that buys and sells books and almost all forms of media.  Visiting one of these stores and seeing what they have available is one of the best ways a community or region reveals its interests.  I've found old Squaresoft games, Kurt Vonnegut novels, Communications of ACM magazines, bizarre Anime and plenty of other stuff.</p><p>Today, I came scross something pretty unique.  It looks like some Japanese nerd decided to sell his collection of Falcom games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp"  /></p><p>Every now and then I'll come across Japanese games in Madison used stores, but Falcom games?  Falcom games are usually only purchased by the nerdiest of hardcore J-RPG fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Nihon Falcom</b></div><p>Falcom is a pretty bizarre game company.  You may know them best as the developer of the Y's franchise, which first premiered in America on the Super Nintendo.  That's the first I had ever heard of them, until <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908">Retronauts</a> did an episode on Falcom earlier this year.  (episode 66)</p><p>They are a successful Japanese PC Game development studio that hasn't done a single Porn game.  Actually, one of their first games, Joshidaisei Private Stripper, sounds like a porn game, but that's the only one!  Their success has been built from their JRPG franchises: Dragon Slayer / Xanadu, Y's, Sorcerian, Legend of Heroes, Brandish.</p><p>Also, even though you can find many of their games on the popular console platforms, Falcom is not responsible for any of their ports except for the PSP.  They contract other development studios to do them.  It's pretty funny listening to the Retronauts crew attempt to list all the companies that have ported a Falcom game to another platform.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Gurumin</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp"  /></p><p>I've only ever played one Falcom game through to completion and that's Gurumin.  One of those games at Half-Priced Books was the original PC version of the game!</p><p>Gurumin is a cute action-RPG in which you play as Palin.  Palin is new to a quiet mining town and becomes lonely with the lack of children.  She does find a friend, but it turns out her new friend is a monster.  A good monster, though.  Their monster town has been ripped apart by other monsters and some even kidnapped.  Palin to the rescue!</p><p>It's a fantastic game with cute characters, cute dialogue, and throw-back PS1 era graphics.  It would be an amazing game if it weren't for the annoying single analog stick controls.  After spending time with Gurumin a couple years ago, I wrote a little bit about it on <a href="/old/v7/psp-gurumin-impressions" title="/psp-gurumin-impressions">October 17th, 2007</a>.  Please get past the horrible writing.</p><div class='title'><b>Purchase</b></div><p>Of the 7 Falcom games at Half-Priced Books, I picked up the 3 chapters of Legend of Heroes and Y's Origin.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp"  /></p><p>After re-reading my Gurumin Impression from 2 years ago, I think I might pick up that one too.  I bet Gurumin PC looks and plays worlds better than the PSP version.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to In the Army Now, with Atlus?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/in-the-army-now-with-atlus">In the Army Now, with Atlus?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In hind-sight, if I remembered the amount of thunderstorms, flooding, and weather havoc that occurred on my <a href="/old/v7/tampa-storms" title="/tampa-storms">visit last year</a>, I probably would've scheduled another weekend.  But!  As luck would have it, this whole weekend it didn't rain once!</p><p>The weather was actually perfect. ^_^  We walked around the base a little bit.

They carry clothes, toys, movies and, of course, video games.  In fact, the PX is a gold mine for video games.  The PX has many games that time forgot.  And since the general populous cannot shop at the PX, it keeps the riff-raff out and the supply high.</p><p>What's really weird is the huge surplus of games published by Atlus.  Atlus is a North American publisher that spends a lot of time and attention on presentation and limited edition releases of their games.  They generally publish a lot of RPGs, including their own super-popular RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei.

It's a treasure trove, but at a cost!</p><p>So that's probably why they still have so many copies of these games.  Why buy a $50 PS2 game that full of pussy Japanese bullshit, when I can buy a badass FPS for the Xbox 360 for only $10 more?!  Riddle me that, civilian!</p><p>Anyways, as you can see in these pictures, they don't have just a few copies of these games in stock.  They have a whole bunch of copies.  And it's not just this PX too.  When Justin was stationed in North Carolina, I picked up copies of Devil Summoner 1 and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne.  Both of which are Atlus published (and developed) games.</p><p>I find it really odd that these military posts have such a huge surplus of these games.  And!  That no one on-base buys any of them.  You'd think the rules of Supply and Demand would be enforced here, but they aren't.  The next time I return to Florida to visit Justin, there will be just as many Atlus games as there were on this trip.  It's really odd.</p><p>They need to put all their Atlus titles on sale or clearance or something.  Hopefully when they do, it'll be the same weekend I'm down there.  My half.com store will have a glut of fantastic games, again!</p><div class='title'><b>Not just Atlus</b></div><p>Atlus is the most prominently published games, but there are plenty of other unappreciated titles on those shelves.</p><p>There were copies of Okami, God Hand, Soul Nomad, and Rhapsody.  There were copies of other NIS games, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp"  /></p><p>If you happen to know someone in our Armed Forces, visit them and take a look at the video game stock at their PX.

| June 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm a huge fan of the Ghostbusters.  Like many people my age, I grew up with the movies and Saturday morning TV show.  I used to pretend I was a Ghostbuster, and run around the backyard with my friends busting ghosts.  Recently, I started getting into the <em>spirit</em> of things thanks to hearing the Ghostbusters theme song at every 80s Night @ Inferno.</p><p>So when I first saw that demo-real footage of this game that popped up online out of the blue back in early 2008, I was completely blown away (ign.com).  Not only was it a next-gen Ghostbustin' game, but it looked really really good.  It didn't look like some cobbled together FPS.  It looked very fluid and real.  Amazing.</p><p>Since this footage came out of nowhere, no one seemed to know anything about it.  A couple days later, after the blogs had done all their research, fact finding and scooping, I knew a little bit more about it.  It was slated for a Fall 2008 release, and was developed by Terminal Reality, whose credits were somewhat poor.  Blood Rayne was their only claim to fame.</p><p>But it looked great, and after a shaky delay due to loss of publisher, Atari picked up the Distribution rights and it finally came out June 16th 2009 (20 years after Ghostbusters II premiered in theaters).</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>A couple weeks after that, Gamely finally sent me a copy for the Playstation 3 and so far, I've been having a great time with it.  Ghostbusters is pretty damn fun. ^_^</p><p>Zach and Justin had mentioned how much they were enjoying the game.  They commented that it was like being in a Ghostbusters film.  And I'd have to agree with them so far.  Egon, Ray, Venkman, and Winston are perfect renditions of their original roles.</p><p>I should hope so considering this game was even possible thanks to Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.  They wrote and developed the story and got everyone back to reprise their original roles.  Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are all voices their original characters.  Annie Potts returns as Janine.  William Atherton returns as Walter Peck.  They've also got Brian Doyle-Murray as the Mayor, and Alyssa Milano as the female lead.</p><p>And this cast works fantastic together.  The dialogue and character balance works perfectly together and forms a new, completely unique entry to the Ghostbusters franchise.  This really feels like the "next" Ghostbusters.  In fact, Dan Aykroyd has said in an interview, "This is essentially the third movie."</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>In Ghostbusters, you play as a new recruit.  You don't actually play one of the original Ghostbusters.  (Though, you might in Multiplayer.. I don't know).  Your character rarely ever speaks, and even though you're the one doing the bulk of the Ghostbustin', you really are on the side lines for the story.</p><p>It actually works out perfectly.  This is the <b>first game</b> in which I play the silent "main" character, and feel like I'm totally immersed in the game's story.  Maybe that's because I'm not the main character.  I'm part of an ensemble cast.  They're the real stars and I'm the support.  For the most part, I'm watching them unravel the story, and speak their hilarious lines.</p><p>But, I'm still totally part of their group.  Bustin' Ghosts is completely a team effort.  They'll throw out their traps while I've captured a ghost in my proton stream.  They'll revive me if I'm knocked down.  And I do the same for them.  They're my pals!</p><div class='title'><b>Virtual Monument</b></div><p>Many of the areas in the game are 3D imaginings of places from the movies.  You can walk around the Ghostbuster HQ, you go to the Sedgewick Hotel featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go to the New York Public Library, also featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go the Historical Museum, as featured in Ghostbusters 2.</p><p>You also come across many artifacts from the two movies.  In fact, the painting of Vigo (from Ghostbusters II) is sitting in the garage of the Ghostbuster HQ.  There are tons of references from the original movies, as well as pop culture from the late 80s.</p><p>Taking a virtual tour of these sets reminds me a lot of <b>Lost Via Domus</b>.  In the Lost game, you play a new character and discover the world of Lost for yourself.  You can walk around the hatch, the beach, the pearl station.  You find artifacts like the VW bus, the 2 skeletons.  You follow the river through the Jungle.  The characters are voiced by their actual actors.  I wrote about this back on <a href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus" title="/lost-via-domus">August 24th, 2008</a>.  It's a virtual world.</p><p>Of course, the big difference is that Ghostbusters the game was written and "created" by their original cast and creators.  Lost Via Domus was a simple fan fiction written by huge fans of the show, who happen to work at Ubisoft.</p><div class='title'><b>Perfect Pacing</b></div><p>Ghostbusters is pretty linear, and has some very gamey pacing.  The game is split up into several different missions.  Chapters, really.  Each chapter is about 2 or 3 hours long depending on how much time you waste blowing stuff up, or searching for artifacts.</p><p>In my opinion, 2 to 3 hours is a perfect length for a chapter.  It's just long enough that you can get through a chapter in one sitting. After you finish a chapter, everyone is back at Ghostbusters HQ figuring out what to do next.  It's the perfect point to set down the controls for the next time you get back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Definitely Play this Game!</b></div><p>If you are or were a fan of the Ghostbusters and LOVE nostalgia, you definitely need to play this game.  I would still suggest renting it though as $60 is still quite a price to pay.</p><p>One thing to note, the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions are identical and were the ones written by the original cast. The Wii, Playstation 2, Nintendo DS, and PSP versions were developed by some other developer and are probably utter crap.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to More Metroid Errata" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/more-metroid-errata">More Metroid Errata</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There's a couple other things I'd like to mention concerning Metroid before I drop the subject for a while.  I find it somewhat odd that I've had Metroid on the brain so much since the announcement of Metroid Other M.  I'm a huge Zelda fan, but I guess I never really considered myself that big of a Metroid fan.  I think a lot of that fandom was taken away by Metroid Prime</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b></div><p>I think the Metroid Prime series adds a whole lot of glitz and glamor and takes away from some of the charm and prestige that Metroid garnished on the Super Nintendo.  I thought it was nice that they took it a different direction than Legend of Zelda for the transition to 3D, but it felt empty.  There was no emotion in the game.</p><p>Anyways, I still think Metroid Prime 1 and Metroid Prime 3 are pretty fun games.  And I think what makes Metroid Prime 3 so great is the fluid controls of the Wii-mote.  So far I think it's one of the best designed games on the Wii.</p><p><b>Luckily!</b>, Nintendo is re-hashing many of their Gamecube classics with Wii-mote / Nunchuck "enhanced" controls.  Nintendo has announced that in August, they'll release <b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b>.  A collection of all 3 Metroid Prime games with Wii-controls for a mere $50.</p><p>For those of you who missed Metroid Prime 1 or 2, or who loved the new controls of Metroid Prime 3, this is the perfect opportunity to revisit these games and experience the full "story" arc of the Metroid Prime series.</p><div class='title'><b>The Emotion of Super Metroid</b></div><p>I think what makes Super Metroid so rich are the emotional moments experienced between Samus and her Metroid hatchling.  Samus found the Metroid hatching after traversing the depths of SR388 uncovering a horrible grotesque plot of Metroid mutation.  The Metroid hatching thinks of Samus as her mother, and there are a couple moments where this mother/child relation fosters itself into something few games did at that time.</p><p>2 years ago, Chad Concelmo of Destructriod wrote an article that focused primarily on this aspect of the game in full detail.  It's a great read: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml">The Memory Card .01: The return of Baby Metroid</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid 2 - fan remake</b></div><p>Metroid 2 is probably the most difficult to replay out of any Metroid game.  Released in 1992 for the Game Boy, Metroid II has not been officially re-released since its debut.  Every Metroid game except Metroid 2 can be played on a modern gaming device.  (Unless you discount the DS Lite due to the DSi release)  You'd need to find a Gameboy Advance in order to play Metroid 2.</p><p>Anyways, Project AM2R has been working on a remake of the game to make it more playable for today's generation.</p><p>Here's their most recent trailer:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="505" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="505" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>It looks pretty fantastic. ^_^.  Check 'em out at <a href="http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/" title="http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/">http://metroid2remake.blogpost.com/</a>.</p><p>I wonder how long it'll be before Nintendo shuts them down.</p><div class='title'><b>Metal Metroid</b></div><p>The song in the background of that trailer totally reminds me Metroid Metal.  Metroid Metal is a group of dudes who've repraised many of the songs throughout the Metroid series in the Metal Rock genre.  Their tracks are pretty slick.</p><p>Check 'em out @ <a href="http://metroidmetal.com/" title="http://metroidmetal.com/">Metroid Metal dot Com</a></p><p><b>News!</b>: As you may have noticed from their website, Metroid Metal will be playing Live at the Penny Arcade Expo this year.

| June 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When Metroid Prime was released in 2002, Nintendo finally had their answer to western First Person Shooters.  Golden Eye and Perfect Dark were legends, but NOW! Nintendo had one of their core franchises in the FPS spotlight.  And felt they had something that contended with the Halo crowd on the Xbox.</p><p>Metroid Prime was the first Metroid game since Super Metroid released 8 years prior, so it was a pretty big deal considering the success of Super Metroid.  Nintendo created Retro Studios, an American based developer who jumped at the chance to make this game.  Shigeru Miyamoto and Yoshio Sakamoto were in regular contact to make sure the game was within Nintendo's vision.</p><p>The third dimension worked great for Nintendo and Metroid Prime became the Gamecube's #6 best selling games of all time with 2.7 million units.  2.7 million doesn't sound like a lot, but keep in mind only 21.7 million Gamecubes were sold worldwide.  Over 10% attach rate is not bad.  (Side Note: Super Smash Brothers Melee is the best selling Gamecube game at 6.1 million units sold, which is a little over 25%.)</p><p>2 years later, Retro Studios released Metroid Prime 2 which continued where Metroid Prime 1 left off.  The FPS gameplay had become iconic for the Metroid series and the idea of a 2D side scrolling adventure became more of a treasured memory of Super Metroid.</p><p>Though, <b>those traditional roots have not been forgotten!</b> They've been merely overshadowed by the graphical splendor.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Fusion</b></div><p>Metroid Fusion is the <b>actual sequel to Super Metroid</b>.  In fact, the opening credits say Metroid 4.  I think this game get overlooked because it was <b>released on the exact same day as Metroid Prime</b>.  Gamers were far more interested in the new fresh look on the Gamecube, rather than an outdated gaming experience on the Gameboy Advance.</p><p>Metroid Fusion's development was headed by Yoshio Sakamoto and everyone else who worked on Super Metroid.  Nintendo still wanted a traditional follow-up to Super Metroid, so they did.  And on November 17th, 2002, fans got a traditional sequel with Metroid Fusion and a fresh perspective on the series with Metroid Prime.  But gamers made their choice.  Where Metroid Prime ultimately sold 2.7 million, Metroid Fusion sold just a little over 1 million.  Metroid Prime was the star.</p><p>Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime are interesting entries in the series.  It's interesting in that Metroid Prime had a radically different way to play the game, but the design was incredibly traditional.  It had the familiar look of Samus and all the same items you remembered from Super Metroid.  Metroid Fusion played the exact same way you remembered from Super Metroid, but the story and character designs were quite different than what you remembered.</p><p>Metroid Fusion has a bunch of cutscenes, text and dialogue that progress the story.  There's actual plot!  The environment, characters, and enemies are all <b>very cohesive</b> and build a decent story.  Unfortunately, the game is incredibly linear which is a big negative for a traditional Metroid.  The game opens up once you beat it, but <b>there are power-ups you can miss!</b> What the hell is that crap?!</p><p>Through and though, Metroid Fusion isn't half bad.  <b>If you liked Super Metroid, I'd totally recommend it</b>. ^_^  Now that I know what happens in Metroid Fusion, <b>I'm pretty interested to see how Metroid Other M fits in to the story.</b> Though, as a big fan of Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion was a let down.  It's good, but not Super Metroid good.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Zero Mission</b></div><p>Metroid Prime 1 was pretty sweet and made Metroid Prime 2 just as highly anticipated.  So much so, that you may have overlooked the very fantastic <b>Metroid Zero Mission</b> released 6 months prior.  You may have also overlooked it because it's a remake.  You may have also overlooked it because word of mouth said Metroid Fusion wasn't so great.  You may have overlooked it because it's on the Gameboy Advance and not the Gamecube.  Whatever...</p><p>Metroid Zero Mission is a remake of the first entry in the series, the original 1986 Metroid.  It's nearly identical through and through, but with tighter graphics, faster, more responsive controls, and more weapons than Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion.  Plus, Zero Mission extends the original Plot to fit better into the overall time line of the Metroid series.</p><p><b>Metroid Zero Mission is fantastic</b>.  It is every bit as good as Super Metroid. And it's sad that it's one of the poorest selling titles in the series at around half a million units sold worldwide.</p><p>After finishing Metroid Fusion, I played a little Zero Mission for the first time in a while and it is so smooth.  Metroid Fusion is like a step back.  Half the time, Samus doesn't move how I want her to move.  The same is with going back to Super Metroid.  Those controls are outdated and Metroid Zero Mission is incredibly modern.</p><p>Much like Super Metroid is to the Super Nintendo, Metroid Zero Mission is one of the best games the Gameboy Advance has to offer.  <b>If you're a fan of Super Metroid, you've got to play this game.</b></p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Other M perspective</b></div><p>Playing through these Metroid games only feed my hype for Metroid Other M.  This is the first game that Yoshio Sakamoto has been deeply involved with since Metroid Zero Mission.  But I don't want to get my hopes up too much.</p><p>It seems like Sakamoto's development team can't really handle the 3rd dimension.  Their original Metroid game for Nintendo 64 Disk Drive was scrapped because it was a mess.  Then, Retro Studios picked up the project and basically started completely over.  The same thing was probably going on again with Project M, until they brought in Team Ninja to bring the 3D nature of the game up to quality.</p><p>I really wonder where Metroid 64 fits into the time line.  Did they take the story and recode it as Metroid Fusion?  Or Do you think this story will finally see the light of day as Metroid Other M?  I think it's probably the latter.  I'm guessing that Metroid Other M is the final product of Metroid 64.  Since it's story was probably too big for the Gameboy Advance.  And Sakamoto probably wanted to keep this story close by rather than let Retro take it.</p><p>Anyways, I'm thinking too much into this.  Metroid Other M won't even be released for another year, and all this speculation and conjecture is really only based on the trailer and <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">Jeremy Parish's interview</a>.  It'll really just build it up to something that won't fit my dream.  Who knows, though.  It's fun to be surprised.</p><p>Previous thoughts on Metroid Other M: <a href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m" title="/metroid-other-m">June 3rd</a>.</p><p><b>Anyways, check out Metroid Zero Mission.</b> ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: DJ Max The Crew Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-dj-max-the-crew-edition">Games I buy: DJ Max The Crew Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 11, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Like most rhythm games that don't include "Guitar Hero" or "Rock Band" in the title, <b>DJ Max</b> has its very niche audience.  It's a rhythm based game just like any other, but is exclusive to the PSP, which cuts the audience down even further.  It's developed by Korean group Pentavision Entertainment and it's music selection is all dancey electronic songs.  Maybe some Hip Hop too.  I'm not sure...</p><p>Unfortunately, I've skipped the entire DJ Max series.  When DJ Max Portable was first released in the fall of 2006, half a year after the American PSP launch, this was my game to buy!  But I never got around to it.  I finally bought a PSP, but still never got around to buying it.  Even when the game finally came out in America, I still didn't buy it for some reason.  I just wasn't in the mood, I guess.</p><p>In March 2009, they announced that Pentavision was releasing a <a href="http://www.bemanistyle.com/djmaxfever/" title="http://www.bemanistyle.com/djmaxfever/">super deluxe packaged release</a> much like their releases in Korea.  So I finally decided that today was the day!  It was limited to a mere 125 pieces.  My Collector's instinct kicked in and I bought one as soon as they were available.</p><p>A month later it finally shipped.  And when I got back from Japan, it finally arrived.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3833.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3833.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3833.webp"  /></p><p>This thing is huge.  That press release had a picture of the side that made it look like a regular PSP case.  There's no way this thing will fit on my shelf.  Pfft.</p><p>The packaging is really nice though.  The material is a hard plastic cardboard.  There are embedded magnets on the flap that keep the box sealed shut.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3834.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3834.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3834.webp"  /></p><p>On the inside, everything is nice and snug inside felt-like grooves.  Included in The Crew Edition is..</p><p>- a 3 disc set of CDs comprising the Soundtrack to DJ Max Fever<br/>- a DJ Max Art book<br/>- a 500 piece puzzle<br/>- a Post Card set<br/>- a Funky Mask<br/>- a DJ Max players card to register high scores online<br/>and<br/>- a copy of DJ Max Fever signed by the Developers.</p><p>Now let's take a look at that last one...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090611_djmax/IMG_3836.webp"  /></p><p>The copy of DJ Max Fever is signed alright, but it's signed on the OUTSIDE of the cellophane.  What the hell good does that do me? I can't unwrap the game.  It'll render the signature useless!  So I still can't play this game I've put off for so long.  Aside from that, this box is huge and doesn't fit on my shelf.</p><p>I think my money would've been better spent buying all the other versions of the game, rather than an expensive version of a single game that I can't open.  At least I can sell it on eBay for a little more than what I bought it for.  Which is what I'll probably do in a couple years.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to B-Quality Gaming All Stars: Cavia Inc" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/b-quality-gaming-all-stars-cavia-inc">B-Quality Gaming All Stars: Cavia Inc</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 10, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Around 2003 and 2004 was the tipping for me when it came to expecting high quality games and movies.  I think it was The Matrix Reloaded that finally pushed me over the edge.  I realized that ridiculous plots and over the top action can make incredible experiences regardless of them actually making sense.</p><div class='title'><b>Drag-on Dragoon / Drakengard</b></div><p>I think Drag-on Dragoon (aka Drakengard) was the video game equivalent for me.  Published by <b>Squaresoft</b> in 2003 (2004 in US), Drag-on Dragoon was touted as their answer to Dynasty Warriors.  You were one man against massive armies of enemy soldiers.  On the battlefield, your soul is fused with a Dragon, and together you fight to end the war and achieve piece.</p><p>It sounds pretty normal... but Jesus was this game bad.  I'm pretty sure it broke me.  In fact, I have the text to prove it!  Read my original thoughts from 5 years ago: <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions" title="/drakengard-impressions">May 22nd, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-2" title="/drakengard-impressions-2">May 27th, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-3" title="/drakengard-impressions-3">June 1st, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v7/drakengard-impressions-4" title="/drakengard-impressions-4">June 6th, 2004</a>.</p><p>First off, The title is pretty ridiculous in its own right.  Japanese titles in general are sometimes pretty crazy, but what the hell does Drag-On Dragoon even mean?!</p><p>Secondly, War brings you to some crazy places.  Killing shit loads of soldiers doesn't really get to me when they're trying to spear or slice me.  But after a few hours in the game, you come across a village whose only defense are their <b>children</b>.  These children hardly hurt you, and they SCREAM very loudly when you tear them apart with your sword.  What the hell is this game trying to teach me?!</p><p>Then shit gets weird...</p><p>Drag-on Dragoon has 5 endings.  The first 3 are pretty normal, but the story branch for the other two endings opens the gateway to HELL.  This massive expanse unloads hundreds upon thousands of gigantic hideous flying human babies into the sky and out for BLOOD.  The first thing they do is devour one of your characters like a fucking animal.  Tearing off her arms and legs.  Stripping the meat from her bones.</p><p>It was the most grotesque surreal image I've ever seen in a video game.  Then the level begins and you're flying around killing these babies.  When these babies die their skin begins melting from their face and bodies as they let out a scream that will haunt me forever.</p><p>I will never forget this video game...  Though, I'd still never heard of <b>Cavia</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Cavia Incorporated</b></div><p>Underneath the cries of dying melting demon babies was Cavia.  Cavia was founded in 2000, partly by Hayao Nakayama, former President of Sega Japan.</p><p>After 3 years in business, they finished their first original game Drag-on Dragoon with Squaresoft publishing.  Their previous games were Anime licenses and such.  And really that's the bulk of their work.  Some Naruto games, Ghost in the Shell, Steam Boy, Dragonball Z, Death Note.  A lot of Namco/Bandai licenses, actually.  These are the type of games you wouldn't play anyways.</p><p>But they pay the bills and give them the freedom to go crazy with games like Drag-on Dragoon.  2 years later they made <b>Drag-on Dragoon 2</b>, but I have not gotten around to playing it.  In that same year, they also finished <b>Beat Down</b>, published by Capcom.</p><div class='title'><b>Bullet Witch</b></div><p>In 2007, I would be graced by Cavia's developmental (emphasis on mental) expertise with Bullet Witch.  Bullet Witch was published by Atari in North America.  I wrote about this game, too! <a href="/old/v7/xbox-360-bullet-witch" title="/xbox-360-bullet-witch">November 13th, 2007</a>.</p><p>Bullet Witch takes place in the near future after half the world has been killed by biological warfare.  An airborne virus has infected and killed most of humanity.  And makes them just weak enough to be ravaged and torn apart when demons climb out of the ground.</p><p>You play as Alicia, who is not quite human.  She has magical abilities to dispel the demons.  But when that doesn't work she has a big gun to rip apart her foes with bullets.</p><p>The demons definitely aren't as off-putting as 30 feet demon babies.  But they still distort and contort their human victims in unnatural ways that made me shake a couple times.  Every enemies still erupts in gallons of blood, too!</p><p>Bullet Witch lets up on the weird psycho shit a bit, and focused a lot more on gaming moments.  My favorite moment is 10,000 feet in the air and fighting some huge flying demon on top of a 747 airliner.  The flying demon is a huge cloud of eye balls that break off and lung themselves at you.</p><p>The dialogue is absolutely b-quality-tastic!  While Drag-on Dragoon is a repetitive boring pile of shit, Bullet Witch has fun with itself.  It's a great way to spend 6 or 7 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>Nier</b></div><p>You may have heard of this game recently.  Cavia and Squaresoft are back together again for a new tale.  You are a one man army killing hordes of demons.  The world is plagued by disease and darkness.  Yes!  That sounds like Cavia to a T!</p><p>Last week at E3, Square released a trailer that described a bit of the story and some of the gameplay.  But that was pretty much it.  The website actually has some content now: <a href="http://na.niergame.com/?lang=US" title="http://na.niergame.com/?lang=US">http://na.niergame.com/</a>.  But overall, there isn't much known about Nier.</p><p>I pity the poor person who sees footage of this game and thinks it's the greatest thing ever.  I mean, I'm somewhat excited for the game, but the "Game Experience" is not what I'm after.  I want this game to shock and disturb me the way that Drag-on Dragoon did when I first sliced into a child.  I want to root for the home team as the characters stumble over their lines of ridiculous dialogue.</p><p>I want to have fun with it. ^_^</p><p>In the meantime, there's Drag-on Dragoon 2 and Beat Down, both on Playstation 2.  I think I'll check those out and bridge the gap between 2003 and 2007.  Stay classy, Cavia.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Other M" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m">Metroid Other M</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the grand finale of Nintendo's Press Conference yesterday, Reggie asked the rhetorical questions, "Could a new edgier game, also be coming from us? ...  We've partnered with a development team with a <em>proven track record</em> in the <em>mature</em> space to give us a <em>fresh take</em> at a <em>storied</em> franchise. .. Here's the preview."</p><p>They rolled the clip, which immediately began with Team Ninja's company intro.  "Project M presents" emerges from a space field of meteors.  "Project M" had been a secret project or team floating around the Wii for a while.  Some stuff in the trailer happens, Samus appears, and title "Metroid Other M" materializes before our eyes.</p><p>Even though most people figured that the M in "Project M" probably stood for Metroid rather than Mario, it's nice to see some confirmation. ^_^  But the addition of Team Ninja is a bit of a shocker.  Team Ninja is about as un-Nintendo as you can get.  They're the development team behind such hits as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series.  They pride themselves on flashy over-the-top Anime-style action gameplay and sequence.  Where as Nintendo is pretty traditional and conservative about their games.  I don't think you could get a "fresh"er look than that.</p><p>The trailer showed a whole lot of action with Samus flipping and hopping around the areas physically beating up enemies, as well as firing them down with her plasma gun.  The trailer also showed several clips of full-fledged cutscenes, which is something Metroid has never done before.</p><p>My immediate gut reaction was not very pleasant.  The Metriod series has always stood for exploration. Adding in all these action sequences feels like they're cheapening the name.</p><div class='title'><b>To the rescue!</b></div><p>Luckily, Jeremy Parish conducted an interview with Team Ninja's Yusuke Hayashi and Project M's Yoshio Sakamoto and asked the hard hitting questions: <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587</a></p><p>His asked a question that dug into the heart of what I wanted to know.  "How do your two completely different game design patterns fit together and still keep Metroid faithful?"  They assured Parish, that Metroid Other M is definitely an exploratory game.  It's just the fire fights have been choreographed with the precision we'd expect from Team Ninja.</p><p>Having Project M head the actual game planning put me at ease about the whole Team Ninja thing.  It sounds like they've wanted to (or were pushed into) develop a "true" 3D Metroid game, but had a little trouble with how they were to implement they actual gameplay.  That's where Team Ninja helped them out. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>Parish went on to ask Sakamoto about where Other M falls into the Metriod timeline, to which he replied, "It's part of the flow, story-wise, between Super Metroid and Fusion."  Which makes sense since the trailer ends with a cinematic of the final scene of Super Metroid.</p><p>The actual chronological order of the Metroid games is all over the map.  It's used to be so easy, but then Metroid Prime was thrown in the mix between Metroid 1 and 2... and then the subsequent releases could do whatever they wanted.</p><p>Here's what it looks like now, as taken from the <a href="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline" title="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline">Metroid Wikia</a>:</p><p>Metroid (NES, 1986) / Metroid Zero Mission (GBA, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime (GC, 2002)<br/>Metroid Prime Hunters (DS, 2006)<br/>Metroid Prime 2 (GC, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime 3 (Wii, 2007)<br/>Metroid 2 (GB, 1991)<br/>Super Metroid (Snes, 1994)<br/><b>Metroid Other M</b> (Wii, 2010)<br/>Metroid Fusion (GBA, 2002)</p><div class='title'><b>Project M explained</b></div><p>To end with, Sakamoto returns to explain what is Project M.  It turns out that Project M is a collaboration of 3 companies working on Other M.  There's the Nintendo team, headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, co-creator of the Metroid series.  There's Team Ninja, headed by Yusuke Hayashi.  And a Third team responsible for the cinematic and game visuals.</p><div class='title'><b>Crisis Averted</b></div><p>After reading that interview, I'm totally excited for Metroid Other M.  It's a new Metroid game designed by the core Metroid team!  Finally!</p><p>Though, they've mentioned Metroid Fusion quite a bit in this Interview.  When released, Metroid Fusion  had some mediocre reviews.  Personally, I never got around to playing it, but I've heard the progress is fairly linear.  Hopefully Metroid Other M will stick to its full exploratory roots that they claim it will.</p><div class='title'><b>The sequel curse</b></div><p>Come to think of it, the Metroid series has a very interesting patterns emerging from its sequels, not unlike the Star Trek series.  All the odd numbered releases are amazing, but the even releases miss the point, or aren't as fun.  Let's see here...</p><p>1986: Metroid 1 ++ new and different!<br/>1991: Metroid 2 -- linear and weird<br/>1994: Super Metroid ++ Best game ever made<br/>2002: Metroid Fusion -- linear again and kinda weird<br/>2002: Metroid Prime ++ Fresh!<br/>2004: Metroid Prime 2 -- horribly unoriginal and dumb<br/>2004: Metroid Zero Mission ++ Excellent!<br/>2006: Metroid Prime Hunters -- forgotten and weird<br/>2007: Metroid Prime 3 ++ Not Bad!<br/>2010: Metroid Other M +/-  thumbs down?!</p><p>So...  does that mean in 2010 we'll be dissapointed?  Pfft.. it's just a silly curse.  Star Trek XI (aka JJ Abrams' Star Trek) is an odd numbered Star Trek and it's pretty damn spiffy.  Curses are meant to be broken.  (or was that "promises are meant to be broken")<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games Games Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-games-games">Games Games Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 2, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>E3 has been fantastic so far, and today was an exceptional day for gamers.  Unlike <a href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me" title="/its-all-melting-around-me">last year when the world was melting around me</a>, Nintendo and Sony had some substantial unveils and a fantastic line up of games.  There are some pretty great looking games coming out on all 3 console platforms and its gotten me excited about video games again!</p><div class='title'><b>Microsoft</b></div><p>From Microsoft's Press Conference <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> looked amazing.  That beginning scene of climbing up the side of a mountain is WORLDS beyond that horrible Modern Warfare 1 opening... ugh.  It's reminds me of the beginning of Mission Impossible 2 actually.  And Star Trek V, come to think of it.  Except you aren't on vacation.  You're scaling this mountain to join a fire fight that ends with a Snowmobile battle!  That totally looks like fun. ^_^</p><p>The next thing I found mildly exciting was the demonstration of <b>Halo Recon</b> (or ODST as they call it these days.)  Though, it's really more of the same.  Walking around, shooting up brutes and other aliens.  They announced <b>Halo Reach</b>, which is another Halo 3 prequel...  Solid Rental titles!</p><p>They also showed off Xbox Live's upcoming synergy with the online space and social networking including <b>Last.fm</b>, <b>Facebook</b>, and <b>Twitter</b>.  I really wonder how many gamers will be twittering and facebooking from their Xbox.  I'll probably hook up all my accounts to Live, but I doubt I'll actually use them after that initial hour.</p><p>And then Kojima came to the stage and announced <b>Metal Gear Solid Rising</b>, a Raiden centric Metal Gear game that leads into Metal Gear Solid 4.  Even though, it was announced for the Xbox, it's also coming to the Playstation, so that makes me happy. ^_^  The REAL megaton would've been if it were Xbox exclusive.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Microsoft showed off <b>Project Natal</b> which uses Camera motion sensing for input.  Instead of having a crappy motion controller, you use your arms, legs, and your entire body to do crap.  Why do we need this crap?  In addition, Peter Molyneux announced their Natal project entitled <b>Milo</b>.  Milo is a 13 year old boy that you talk and interact with.  Fucking creepy, if you ask me.</p><p>And they ended on that.  They showed off far more games than I described above including <b>Crackdown 2</b>, <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, <b>Alan Wake</b>, <b>Rockband: Beattles</b>, <b>Tony Hawk Ride</b> with that ridiculous skateboard controller, <b>Forza 3</b>, and a couple of other games.</p><p>All in all, I think Microsoft's conference was pretty solid.  They showed off a ton of games and some new stupid crap to boot!  They didn't show anything from Mass Effect 2 though...</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Nintendo started right off the bat by announcing <b>New Super Mario Brothers Wii</b>, a 4 player co-op/competitive take on the 2006 DS game.  This game looks incredibly fun.  It's very much like Legend of Zelda 4 Swords, in which you have 4 players basically playing the same 2D game at the same time.  I can't wait to play this game at parties.</p><p>Then they went off on Wii Fit Plus and Wii Motion Plus and how 3rd Party adoption of Wii Motion Plus is great.  They showed off some RPGs.  Crystal Bearers on Wii looks a lot like Sin &amp; Punishment.  Mario &amp; Luigi RPG 3 was announced for America!  And Golden Sun DS!  They also mentioned <b>Zelda Train Simulator</b> in there somewhere.</p><p>Then they announced <b>Women's Murder Club: Games of Passion</b>, which sounds like an episode of the Red Shoe Diaries..  These are interactive novels written by James Patterson for the DS.  Sounds very interesting.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Iwata got up on stage, talked for too long, and then unveiled something EVEN more bizarre than Project Natal, the <b>Wii Vitality Sensor</b>.  It's an accessory that you clip on your finger, and it monitors your heart rate.  Iwata mentioned no properties that used this, no gaming prospects, nothing!  "Look what we made!  It's a thing!"  Were they just going for the hat-trick of announcing 3 upcoming accessories for the Wii, or was there an actual purpose for unveiling this technology?!</p><p>Reggie returned to the stage and brought us all back to earth by announcing <b>Super Mario Galaxy 2</b>!  Really?!  Why?  Isn't it a little soon for another canon Mario game?  This reminds me a lot of Japanese Super Mario Bros 2 (aka Lost Levels), where they reused all the assets from the first game, and just added more levels.  I think Mario Galaxy 2 cheapens Mario Galaxy 1.  Which is unfortunate because Mario Galaxy is a <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-impressions" title="/super-mario-galaxy-impressions">fantastic</a> <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts" title="/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts">achievement</a>.</p><p>Reggie continued by showing off their strong third party lineup including The Conduit, Resident Evil Dark Side Chronicles and Dead Space Extraction.</p><p>And then Reggie concluded with <b>Metroid Other M</b>, which I have mixed feelings about.  Metroid Other M is being developed by Team Ninja, creators of the new Ninja Gaiden series.  The trailer showed the prospects of a very story-centric Metroid mixed with a whole lot of action.  While I'm excited about Story returning to Metroid, which has been absent throughout Metroid Prime, I think the over-the-top action sequences will cheapen the depth of gameplay Metroid is known for.  We shall see....</p><p>Nintendo has a strong start and a strong finish, but it was so goddamn boring in the middle.  Still, they have a pretty decent lineup coming up.  They didn't announce Pikmin 3 nor Zelda Wii nor Kid Icarus.  Seriously though, why would they announce Zelda Wii when they've got Zelda Train Simulation coming up!  They'll announce it next year, and by then it'll almost be done!</p><div class='title'><b>Sony</b></div><p>Out of the big 3, I think Sony's brand is spread the furthest across gaming.  They have the Playstation 2, Playstation 3 and the PSP.</p><p>Well, they begin with some games.  Naughty Dog reps get up on stage and begin to demo <b>Uncharted 2</b>, which looks pretty nice.  The graphics have that very warm color palette that almost all PS3 exclusive titles have.  All the models are very solid and tangible.</p><p>The demo begins across some rooftops until they've discovered by a helicopter!  The helicopter opens fire and you're leaping from balcony to balcony, jumping away from gun fire, dodging bullets, while holding cover and blowing away some bad dudes...  This whole scene totally reminds me of the helicopter fight from Tomorrow Never Dies.  You escape into a building, but it's taken damage from the helicopter and eventually tumbles to the ground seconds after you leap out a window to safety!</p><p>I don't think I've ever seen an action sequence in a game so closely resemble something seen in an action movie.  That demo was incredible.  And Nathan Drake is hilarious as he makes subtle commentary during the fight scenes.</p><p>They showed off the new PSP, and some other games and eventually got to the new trailer for <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, with that absolutely fantastic battle music. Afterward, Jack Trenton starts talking about the "next" Final Fantasy game, which I assume is Final Fantasy XIII Versus, but he says <b>Final Fantasy XIV</b>.  What?!  Did I hear that right?  "Exclusive to Playstation 3 is Final Fantasy XIV, roll that beautiful bean footage!"</p><p>What the?!  Final Fantasy XIII isn't even out yet.  and Final Fantasy XIV is expected to release globally in 2010?!  At the end, the trailer says "Final Fantasy XIV Online", and everyone slaps their head, "D'oh!"  It's just the successor to Final Fantasy XI.  Well, hopefully it won't be as boring...</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Some Sony dudes get to the stage and unveil an accessory that is the spitting image of one of those "back massagers" that everyone uses as a vibrator.  I could hardly contain my laughter sitting at my desk at work.  "We want this device to be in the hands of our consumers." AHahahahahhaa</p><p>But the demo wasn't that bad.  The detection looked far better than the Wii-mote.</p><p>Sony ended with 3 more PS3 games: Gran Turismo 5, God of War 3, and <b>The Last Guardian</b>, which was what I was waiting for.  Previous known as Project Trico, this is the third game in the Team ICO trilogy which includes ICO and Shadow of the Colossus.  They played the trailer that was leaked a couple weeks ago, but had a couple more pieces that were missing before.  It looks fantastic ^_^ and of all 3 press conferences, <b>this is my number 1 game</b>.  I cannot wait for The Last Guardian.  ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of steam from Sony's Conference was taken away by constant leaks leading up to E3.  The Final Fantasy XIV announcement was huge!  But they would've nailed it out of the park if The Last Guardian hadn't leaked, and the PSP Go hadn't leaked.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Nintendo's conference was a little boring, but overall all 3 had some solid games and great announcements. ^_^  All 3 platforms have games I'm interested in for the upcoming year, which makes me excited to be a gamer once again.  Honestly, I thought Christmas 2008 was horrible for games.  Dead Space was the only game that hit it out of the park, and that came out in September.  The disappointments were vast..  Fable 2 sucked, Mirror's Edge sucked, Fallout 3 is boring.  I don't even remember what was released for Wii.</p><p>But for Late 2009, Early 2010, there's tons of crap!  Something for everyone.  Games Games Games!  Even weird ones.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/14">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/12">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
