| January 25, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>With the anticipated release of Mass Effect 2 only hours away, I found myself thinking about it on the way home.  I was trying to think of a way I could scam Gamestop out of a DLC code for their <em>exclusive</em> weapons and armor.  I don't actually care about having the items in the game, but I kinda want that DLC card to complete my edition.</p><p>I had already preordered Mass Effect 2 Collector's Edition months ago on Amazon.  Plus, I bought a preorder at Best Buy, so I could get their <em>exclusive</em> armor.</p><div class='title'><b>Wait!</b></div><p>But then I thought, "Didn't I order Mass Effect 2 with release day shipping from Amazon?  Shouldn't that have shipped already?  Shouldn't I have gotten an email about it?"  Way back when the Collector's Edition first appeared on amazon I didn't instantly buy it.  I was waiting for the ECA to release more Amazon discount codes, or waiting for a discounted Amazon price, rather than the full $70.  I thought, "Did I actually forget to go back and actually buy it?  Did I never actually order it?"</p><p>I was on my way to Gamestop, anyways.  I wanted that DLC card.  And, as a consolation, I was going to Preorder Yakuza 3 since Gamestop has <em>exclusive</em> DLC for that, too.  Ugh.</p><p>When I parked my car, I brought up Amazon on my iPhone and checked my open orders and there was <b><em>nothing!</em></b> I saw no order for Mass Effect, or any history of ever buying it.  Whoops.</p><div class='title'><b>Scavenger Mode</b></div><p>The game comes out tomorrow and I don't actually have a Collector's Edition spoken for.  So, I tried "preordering" at Gamestop since I was there.  Typically, Gamestop will only let you preorder games up until the week before its release.  They won't let you preorder a game that comes out the next day because they already have all their copies in stock.  You'd essentially be buying someone else's copy.  Which would be the same if anywhere let me preorder it at this point.</p><p>But I thought, "eh, fuck it.  Perhaps the employees aren't keen on this fact."  Unfortunately they were keen.  And, in addition, Gamestop discontinued the preorder of Mass Effect 2 Collector's Edition a mere 3 weeks after its availability in the system.  I just stuck with my preorder of <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=76648" title="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=76648">Yakuza 3</a>.</p><p>Best Buy was taking preorders, so that was my next stop.  Even though, I had already preordered the game through Best Buy, I was pretty sure it was the regular edition I laid out $5 for.  I checked the place to see if they were stupid enough to leave out all their preorder boxes, and they were not.  All the boxes had been removed from the shelf.</p><p>In fact, now that I'm at home, I actually preordered the PC version by mistake.  At the time I bought it, they must've already removed all their boxes for the Xbox 360 version.  Which would go along with Gamestop's story of only preordering the game for 3 weeks.</p><p>I stopped off at Toys R Us to see if they were offering preorders.  They would definitely be ignorant to the point of forgetting something like that.  But they were not offering.</p><div class='title'><b>Internet</b></div><p>Unfortunately, those were really my only choices to turn to in the real world.  I don't think any other retailer in Madison would carry the Collector's Edition; let alone, not be knowledgeable enough for me to prey on.  So, the Internet is my final recluse.</p><p>Amazon no longer accepts orders.  Though, some sellers have theirs available for $110.  Best Buy dot Com has no availability.  GameStop dot Com doesn't accept my credit card anymore.  Plus, they're out too.  Doing a Shopping Search on Google gives retailers who are either sold out, or very shady.</p><p>There's a bunch of dudes on eBay selling their copies, and one particular dude selling his for $90 w/ free shipping.  An extra $20 isn't TOOO bad.  Plus, I sold the Collector's Edition DLC from Dragon Age for $40.  I could probably do the same and walk away with a $50 game.  Eh, fuck it.  I've wasted more money on less before.  Besides, my Paypal Account has enough money to cover the whole thing.</p><p>Cha-ching.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Investigation</b></div><p>After being in my head for this whole venture, which lasted about an hour, I went back to Amazon dot Com (this time on my computer).  I went around in my order explorer and actually <b>found</b> my order for Mass Effect 2.  Apparently it didn't show up in my future or past orders because it's in the "now shipping" order queue.  It can't be changed or modified because they're currently putting it together to ship.</p><p>The estimated arrival date is January 26th, though.  I don't know how they plan on getting that package to my apartment tomorrow, if they're still busy putting it in a box, right now.</p><p>As a result of all this nonsense, I find myself with an extra copy of the Collector's Edition.  I'll probably just turn around and put it back on eBay.  Someone will probably buy it for $100.</p><p>Still no DLC card from Gamestop. :/</p><p>I think I need something better to do with my evenings...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Spring is the new Fall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/spring-is-the-new-fall">Spring is the new Fall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 19, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As I peer over at my library of video games, there are very few that I have purchased that were released in 2009.  I bought a couple games such as Retro Game Challenge, KORG DS-10, Pokemon Platinum, Street Fighter IV, Katamari Forever, Dragon Age, Raiden IV, and Metroid Prime Trilogy but that's really it.  There were only 8 games from last year that I felt were worth owning.</p><p><em>Edit:  I also bought Flower and Wipeout HD Fury which were PSN titles.  And that 3D Picross game for the Japanese DS.  So that brings the total to 11.</em></p><p>Don't get me wrong, 2009 had some great games, but many of which I finished in the span of a weekend and felt finished with them afterward.  I rented them through GameFly and just sent them back after completion.  Katamari and Dragon Age were exceptions to that...  Of course, there are still many I haven't gotten around to playing, yet.</p><p>2010 is looking very bright to me. There are many games coming in the next 5 months I can't wait to play.  There are as follows...</p><p>January 26th - <b>Mass Effect 2</b> - Xbox 360<br/>February 16th - <b>Ace Attorney Investigations: Edgeworth</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>February 16th - <b>KORG DS-10 Plus</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>February 23rd - <b>Heavy Rain</b> - Playstation 3<br/>March 9th - <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b> - Playstation 3<br/>March 14th - <b>Pokemon Heart Gold / Soul Silver</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>March 16th - <b>Dragon Age Awakening (expansion)</b> - Xbox 360<br/>March 22nd - <b>Yakuza 3</b> - Playstation 3<br/>May 11th - <b>3D Dot Game Heroes</b> - Playstation 3</p><p>There's 9 games on the list already, and that doesn't include Dead Rising 2, Epic Mickey, Sin and Punishment 2, Metroid Other M, <a href="http://augmentpro.com/halloween-ghostwire-augmented-reality-game-for-2010/" title="http://augmentpro.com/halloween-ghostwire-augmented-reality-game-for-2010/">Ghostwire</a> (that Augmented Reality ghost game on the DSi), Death Smiles and any other shmup that may be released in North America.</p><p>Also, I'll probably pick up a Nintendo DSi XL when those are released.  My Nintendo DS has been beaten incredibly hard and the touchscreen cannot be calibrated for accuracy anymore.  It has served me well these past 4 years, but games like Ouedan and Trauma Center are unplayable.</p><p>And with KORG DS-10 Plus and Ghostwire actually making use of the DSi features, it should be worth it.  Plus, there's all those downloadable puzzle games. ^_^  And there's that pile of unplayed DS games sitting on my shelf, as well.</p><p>Video Games!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect 2 DLC (+ Dr. Pepper)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-2-dlc-dr-pepper">Mass Effect 2 DLC (+ Dr. Pepper)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 19, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dragon Age DLC</b></div><p>Bioware's recent game, Dragon Age, had an immense amount of Downloadable Content at launch.  I'm not specifically talking about the two extra quest lines: The Stone Prisoner and The Warden's Keep, which were both cut areas from the initial release of the game, and were offered free for those who actually purchased the game..  I'm talking about all the stupid items.</p><p>Nearly every first pressing of Dragon Age included the Blood Armor.  Preorders from Gamestop included a Memory Band, Guildmaster's Belt, Feral Wolf Charm, and a couple others.  Preorders from other places included a Dalish Ring, Lion's Paw, Band of Fire, and other crap.  If you bought the Collector's edition, you were treated with a spell book, a helmet, and a staff.</p><p>Beyond that, if you created a Character through the PC Character Creator, you'd receive some charm necklace.  There's also a Flash game available on DragonAge.com, that will net you 3 items throughout your playthrough.</p><p>It's all detailed in this GameFAQ: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/950918/58270</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect 2 DLC</b></div><p>It's pretty ridiculous.  And there's doing the exact same thing with Mass Effect 2.  Preorders from Gamestop include some set of Armor.  Preorders from other places will receive a different set of Armor.  If you bought Dragon Age and received that Blood Armor, that's unlocked in Mass Effect 2 also.</p><p>Also, if you play through the Mass Effect iPhone game, you unlock something in the game too.  I think one of the blogs around that time said you unlock an extra side quest where you meet the characters in the iPhone game.  That would definitely be better than an item.</p><p>There's also this way:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100118_masseffect2/IMG_6345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100118_masseffect2/IMG_6345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100118_masseffect2/IMG_6345.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Dr. Pepper</b></div><p>Every specially marked bottles of Dr. Pepper will give you an unlock code.  Enter this code at DrPepper.com, and you can choose from a pile of DLC from an assortment of EA games.  Each unlock will be transferred to your EA account, and can be accessed from those games.</p><p>When I was refueling my automobile this evening, I entered the convenience store and bought the bottles shown above.  Unfortunately, Mass Effect 2 unlocks were not available on DrPepper.com at the moment.  Maybe that's because Mass Effect 2 isn't out yet?  Or maybe, a whole lot of gaming nerds bought a bunch of Dr. Pepper and redeemed all the available codes.  Probably the former.  I think some blog mentioned there are 5 unlocks for Mass Effect 2 through this promotion.  Each one a piece of Armor or a Weapon.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Random Tidbits</b></div><p>There are 2 other note-worthy pieces of news about the upcoming release of Mass Effect 2 that delight me.  The first one is that Bioware has said they plan on supporting Mass Effect 2 through expansions and DLC over the next two years.  They plan on doing this with Dragon Age as well, which has a expansion due in March which will add another 20-30 hours to the game.</p><p>The other tidbit is that Bioware has stated that they do not plan for the release time between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 to be as long as it has for the first release and next week.  They specifically stated that Mass Effect 3 will be released on current generation hardware.  It will not be on the Xbox 720, or whatever.</p><p>It seems that those "2 years" of expansions and DLC will lead up to the release of the final chapter in the Mass Effect Trilogy, which would be released sometime in 2012. Nice!</p><div class='title'><b>Excitement</b></div><p>Anyways, Mass Effect 2 is released next week! Hopefully, it'll be the "Empire Strikes Back" of the Trilogy, and not "Attack of the Clowns"</p><p>I'm quite excited.  Mass Effect is my favorite new game franchise spawned in this generation.  Its soundtrack is very moody and Sci Fi.  It's entire universe is very well thoughout, solid, and lends itself well to telling an interesting story without focusing on all the Science Fiction. It looks amazing. The art direction is diverse, sleek and sexy.</p><p>I think the one thing Mass Effect lacked were iconic characters.  I really hope the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team talked to each other over the course of development.  I think Dragon Age has set the bar for character interactions and distinct personalities.  It would be a shame if Mass Effect did not have those moments were you truly feel for the other characters.</p><p>Maybe it's hard to build sympathy or empathy for an alien or alien culture? Though, I think District 9 and Avatar did an alright job... just make Humans the bad guys!</p><p>Anywho, I can't wait to see how Mass Effect 2 unfolds. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Modern Warfare 2 and Its Message" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/modern-warfare-2-and-its-message">Modern Warfare 2 and Its Message</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 7, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Talking this game is somewhat of a moot point.  Everyone knows about its existence and how it was the most anticipated game of 2009 and the highest grossing game as well.  And most people know of the controversial Airport scene.</p><p>I knew these things, but didn't really care.  I wasn't a fan of the original, and never really saw the appeal either.  I can't really find the words to describe why I disliked it.  I played it for about 20 minutes before I set the controller down and said, "this game is not for me."  I seemed unpolished, generic, and dull.  But whatever, lots of people seem to like it.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple weekends ago at Dave's place that I actually had a chance to play Modern Warfare 2, so I figured why not.  The videos that were shown at E3 made the game look beautiful.  And after the first couple of minutes, Modern Warfare 2 definitely prides itself on presentation.  It is one of the most beautiful looking games out there.</p><p>The beginning eased me into how to shoot things, and how to fight effectively in combat using more than just my main weapon.  Switching to a handgun is faster than reloading.  Using your knife is an instant kill when you're next to an enemy.  Also, your weapon will always snap to a nearby target when aiming.  It's easy to play, and lends itself well to different strategies when fighting many enemies.  There's always another way to accomplish your task.</p><p>Essentially, Modern Warfare 2 charmed me with its graphics, and the fluid varied controls kept me playing and challenged.  Last week, I received it from Gamefly and began my assault.</p><p><b>Airport Scene</b> (spoilers)</p><p>For those that don't know about the "airport scene"...  In the 4th chapter entitled "No Russian", you play as Private Allen.  He's the recruit you played in the beginning while getting used to the controls, and then put into a battle field fighting a militia.  At the end of the mission, General Shepard says he has a special mission for you.  You are to stick close to Makarov as a deep cover agent.  And this has brought you to a Russian airport.</p><p>The mission begins in a closet with Makarov and some other guys.  You are dressed in suits, bullet proof vests, and armed with chain guns.  Before Makarov opens the door he says, "Remember..  No Russian."  You walk out of the closet in a crowded airport security checkpoint.  Your group aims their weapons, and fire on the crowd.  You continue through the airport terminal mascaraing any individuals you find.  Some security guards fight back, but you can't get hurt.  Your group murders everyone.</p><p>Throughout this opening scene, you can choose to kill the innocent or do nothing.  If you shoot any of your group, the game quits and pulls you back to your last checkpoint.  If you stand back the doorway and not move anywhere, your group will wait.  The game forces you through this entire scene, and you can't prevent anything from happening, unless you want to quit the game completely.</p><p>After going through the terminal, walking over all the innocent slain, the Russian forces arrive and you fight them and make your way to the get-a-way car.  Everyone hops in in front of you.  Someone comments, "This will definitely send a message."  As the last person in, Makarov stops you, and pierces your chest with a bullet.  Makarov replies, "No, this is the message."  And your dead American body responsible for this terrorist attack on Russia creates war between America and Russia.</p><p><b>The Ending</b> (spoilers)</p><p>Throughout Modern Warfare 2 you go back and forth between "Ramirez" fighting Russian troops on American soil, and "Roach" part of Task Force 141 who know that Makarov is behind the terrorist attack and follow his trail throughout the world to uncover his plot.  Eventually, you find out that General Shepard is the one behind the attacks, and everything comes to climax assaulting his hidden base head-on and eventually facing him.</p><p>The final battle is between you, playing "Soap" MacTavish and Captain Price versus General Shepard.  The battle begins with Shepard hopping on a boat and taking off.  Naturally, you and Price grab the second boat and take off after him.  There's lot of rockets, helicopters, and other boats to fight and dodge as you close in Shepard's boat.</p><p>Eventually Shepard gets far enough ahead of you that he boards a helicopter.  Price orders you to steady to boat as he takes a few shots and takes down the helicopter.  Unfortunately, you've gone to far down the rapids and go over a waterfall.</p><p>When you wake, you pull yourself up, take out your knife, and stagger towards the smoldering crashed helicopter.  You find an enemy soldier trying to get away.  You slice him.  You find another one next to the crash, reading his gun.  He pulls the trigger, but it's empty.  You slice him.  A few feet forward, Shepard pops out of the wreck and staggers forward.  You continue after him.  He stops at a wrecked car to catch his breath.  You go in for the kill...  But he catches you, smacks you head on the side of the car, knocks you to the ground, and stabs you in the chest.  The world goes dark.</p><p><b>The Message</b> (spoilers)</p><p>You wake a couple seconds later to Shepard's voice...  "5 years ago, I watched as 30,000 of my men were slaughtered.  All of them died for their country as America sat back and watched.  Tomorrow, thousands will line up to volunteer in this war.  It doesn't matter who started it."  "The Victors write history," he says as he points his revolver in your face.</p><p>It doesn't end there.  Price jumps Shepard as he pulls the trigger, and saves your life.  As Price and Shepard out of your vision, you see the revolver and struggle over to it hitting RT and LT to move.  Shepard gets the upper hand, kicks the gun away, and knocks you out.  You fade in and out of consciousness as they fight.  Shepard gets the upper hand again, but you notice the knife in your chest.</p><p>Here's where Modern Warfare 2 takes a fantastic gameplay cue from <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b>.  To pull the knife out of your chest, you must bang away at the X button.  You need to HURRY though!  Price is getting his ass kicked.  It takes a lot out of you (the player) to bang away at the button to make the game continue.  It attempts to convey the physicality of what your character is going through.  Through this scene I'm thinking to myself, "C'mon!! You can make it, C'mon! C'mon!"</p><p>After railing that X button for about 20 seconds the knife is out and you chuck it into Shepard's eyeball.  Success!</p><div class='title'><b>Digesting the Message</b></div><p>So, the whole reason this [fictional] war was started was to get America off its fat, lazy, ignorant ass and do something for their country.  There's definitely something to that.</p><p>I think this message gives the Airport Scene relevance by putting you in the shoes of a murderer.  Yeah, there are people out there that do this.  And yeah, this is what happens when you sit by and do nothing.  There are consequences to your inactions.</p><p>One of the quotes presented throughout the game really emphasizes this point:</p><p><em>"A citizen of America will cross the ocean to fight for democracy but won't cross the street to vote in a national election"</em> - Bill Vaughn</p><p>Hopefully the tens of millions of gamers playing Modern Warfare 2 take something from this message and, at the very least, not make the problems in America worse.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Also, I just beat Modern Warfare 2's campaign on Veteran.  Is this mode supposed to be hard?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dragon Age &amp; Game Longevity" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dragon-age-game-longevity">Dragon Age &amp; Game Longevity</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Back in High School and College, I used to measure a game's worth based on the amount of time spent playing it.  If it took me at least 60 hours for me to reach the end, then I fully felt like I got my money's worth.  I felt cheated if I bought a game only to beat it a mere 10 hours later.  With games running up a bill of $50 or $60, it was too much to spend on something that would only keep my attention for no more than a week.</p><p>But, things change...</p><div class='title'><b>Games have changed</b></div><p>Back in the day, the only games that made me feel something were those that had enough time to build character.  RPGs and Adventure games took me on a long journey.  I met new characters, and helped them sort out their lives.  Which in turn, let my own character learn more about themselves.  Given the amount of time spent with the characters, I grew attached to them and the story started to mean something to me.  I cared about what happens for more than just curiosity sake.  I want my characters to succeed, fall in love, and overcome their heart ships.</p><p>Other games, like 1st person shooters and action games, didn't have the capacity for passion.  It was more about the fun you had playing the game.  Which is perfectly fine, of course.  But for me, most games feel incredibly empty if they aren't engaging me on an emotional level.</p><p>I don't find that's the case anymore.  The game industry has matured to the point where a game nearly fails if it doesn't connect to the player on an emotional level.  It's boring if the characters an empty shells and have no humanity.  Having an interesting story with engaged characters is as pivotal to success as making sure the game works to begin with.</p><p>Games like <b>Uncharted 2</b>, <b>Batman Arkham Asylum</b>, <b>Brutal Legend</b>, <b>Shadow of the Colossus</b>, <b>Fatal Frame</b>, <b>Bioshock</b>, <b>Dead Space</b> are all ones that will take someone no longer than 10 or 15 hours to complete.  You can easily complete the game throughout the course of a weekend.  And within that time is an incredibly rich experience.  Just as rich as any Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy.</p><p>In fact, I find these games much more engaging <em>because</em> they won't take up longer than a weekend.</p><div class='title'><b>I have changed</b></div><p>I graduated college 3 years ago, and have worked almost every day since.  My weekday is spent thoughtfully thinking about elegant solutions to complex and interesting problems.  It's spent building applications and maintaining them.  I don't have time to think about some game that I'm in the middle of playing.  It really ends up being a distraction.</p><p>In my spare time, I do more than just game.  I sell things on eBay.  I hang out with friends.  I try and fail to meet girls.  I listen to music.  I go to clubs.  I go to other events on the weekends and sometimes during the week.  I meet people for dinner.  I read, though not often.  I shop for games, and sometimes other things.  And plenty of other crap.  And usually afterward, I write about the more interesting things.  Plus, there are other games to play.</p><p>Finishing a game within a weekend gives me the perfect opportunity to completely devote myself to it.  I usually won't have any distractions at all, unless I meet up with some friends at a bar on Saturday night.  Once I wake up on Sunday, I can sit in front of the TV all day and think about nothing else.</p><p>Without any real distractions, I get more out of the game.  I experience it all from start to finish.  And then I usually reflect by writing something about it.  (Unless the game really didn't mean anything, afterall).  A free weekend is perfectly suited for a game, but if it starts spilling into the week it starts eating into time I can, should, or want to do something else.</p><div class='title'><b>Dragon Age</b></div><p>Dragon Age has been the first game I've played in a while that exceeds 20 hours, and it's really annoying.  I've only been able to play the game in 10 hour chunks here and there, and it's almost been a month since I started.  Many of my friends have actually finished the game well before me.  It really feels like it's been dragging on and on.  Though, the game does splinter off in different directions that aren't very well connected, so it's hard to hold on to all the story at once.</p><p>In the beginning, I was gun-ho! about playing the game through a second time, but there's no way I'd find the time.  I might take a look at some of the other Origin stories, but I think they'll feel empty to me.</p><p>Dragon Age is all about the character I made and have spent these 45 hours with.  She may not say a word of dialog throughout the game, but she has actually changed.  Or rather, I have changed the character I portray.</p><div class='title'><b>My Story</b></div><p><em>(I went the path of the Female Human Nobel or Warrior Princess named Rikki.)</em></p><p>After my kingdom had been destroyed and my family slain by Howe, I was a mean, sad little girl.  I was rude to others, and even killed those who were unfortunate because I didn't care.  I thought it was funny with the little power I had over them.</p><p>But then I met Lelianna.  Someone who deep down used to do what I was doing, but was now I devote religious person.  I didn't care much for the religion, but it made sense to actually act with the grace and nobility that ran through my blood.  I took Lelianna as an example, and throughout the course of our adventures came quite close.</p><p>Alistair, Morrigan, Lelianna, and I went across the land of Fereldan and continued our quest to unite the land.  I learned all about my friend's pasts.  Lelianna and I fell in love I suppose.  Once we ended this blight, we would disappear together.  We would travel the world and see everything there is to see.</p><p>We discovered Alistair's little secret.  He was incredibly reluctant, but he's actually King Calyn's brother and first in line for the Throne of Fereldan.  I could hardly believe it, but Alistair did nothing but whine about it.  He and I talked about a bit and I think I talked some sense into him.  We talked a lot, and he's actually pretty funny.</p><p>Once we reunited our lands, it was time to face that fucker Loghain.  But to truly unite Fereldan, we'd need a King.  Alistair would have to take the throne.  We faced Loghain and totally overthrew him.  It was now my decision between Alistair and Loghain's daughter.  OOOoOhhHHHhhhh..  but what is this?  I can use my persuasion, marry Alistair right now, and become Queen!  Hell yeah!</p><p>Not soon after I made my decision, Alistair really assumed the role as King.  He truly became a great man, and the best character in the whole game.  I'm sorry about having lead on Lelianna, but Alistair had validated my decision and my future is with him.</p><p>And now I'm heading into the final battle to defeat the Archdemon and save the world from this Blight.  After a full month of preparing, this will finally be over.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Youge (洋ゲー)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/youge">Youge (洋ゲー)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the past 3-4 years gaming has changed considerably.  In 2005, the Xbox 360 was released, and then in 2006, the Playstation 3 and Wii were released.  Obviously, we're in a new era of gaming with which consoles are on the market, but the considerable change has been the paradigm shift from Japan's dominance in game development to Western.  And by Western, I mean Europe and North America, the "western" civilizations.</p><p>From Nintendo's "splash" in America in 1985 with <b>Super Mario Bros.</b>, and later with <b>Legend of Zelda</b>, and <b>Metroid</b> and Sega's <b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b>, Western development had been behind the curve.  Maybe because we never really thought of gaming as a mature medium.  Most western games were lower quality copies of their Japanese counterparts, while Nintendo and Sega were iterating on their ideas.  Capcom created <b>Mega Man</b> and <b>Street Fighter</b>, Konami created <b>Castlevania</b>.</p><p>There were definitely a couple games that were born in Western game development that established genres as well.  ID created <b>Wolfenstein </b>and <b>Doom</b>, Westwood created <b>Command &amp; Conquer</b>, and Blizzard created <b>Warcraft</b>.  But these First Person Shooters and Real Team Strategy games were absolutely foreign to Japan.  There is something distinct and exclusive to Japanese culture that I'm not sure anyone has ever defined.  If something foreign does not resonate with these ideals it will not be adopted.</p><p>Japan is also incredibly nationalistic and narcisistic at times.  It's only natural that when they're on their game, they become full of themselves.  I'm sure this is where the term <b>Youge</b> originated its discriminatory meaning.</p><div class='title'><b>Youge</b></div><p>Youge literally translates as Western Game.  "You-" (<span class='ja'>洋</span>) is the prefix for Western things, and Ge is short for Geemu (<span class='ja'>ゲーム</span>) or Game.  It's discriminatory double meaning has been born out of their dominance and disregard for Western game development.</p><p>From their 20 year dominance over game development, Western Games have been seen as second class in Japan.  32-bit era games and last-gen games like <b>Metal Gear Solid</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time</b>, <b>ICO</b>, <b>Shadow of the Collosus</b>, <b>Okami</b>, <b>Final Fantasy VII </b>and <b>Final Fantasy X </b>did things with story and gameplay that truly brought maturity to gaming.</p><p>For me, everyone of those games I've gotten emotionally attached to.  I cared for the characters and story.  There wasn't any game that came from the Western side of things that made me feel anything beyond the normal enjoyment of the game.</p><p>But that began changing with the Xbox.  Western developers now had a video game platform outside of the PC, and began taking some of Japan's ideas as their own.  Games like <b>Grand Theft Auto 3</b>, <b>Halo</b>, <b>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</b>, and <b>Prince of Persia Sand of Time </b>were mature products that had mass appeal but were uniquely Western.</p><p>In today's era, there have been an incredibly few Japanese games that have done anything interesting. <b> Dead Rising</b>, <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess </b>and <b>Super Mario Galaxy </b>are just about it.  They stand along-side far more Western games such as <b>Halo 3</b>, <b>Mass Effect</b>, <b>Oblivion</b>, <b>Bioshock</b>, <b>Grand Theft Auto 4</b>, <b>Dead Space</b>, <b>Fallout 3</b>, <b>Batman Arkham Asylum</b>, and <b>Dragon Age</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japan needs to get over it</b></div><p>Kotaku had an article this morning translating Youichi Wada's (CEO of Square Enix) news report about their upcoming release of <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b> and the recent worldwide release of <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> (<a href="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory" title="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory">here</a>).  He says that Japan needs to get over this discriminatory meaning.  Western games are truly leading the world, and Japan has got to face facts and recognize their success.</p><p>Wada isn't the only one.  Keiji Inafune said the exact same thing during Tokyo Game Show this year, exclaiming, <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/">Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished.</a>"  Evolve or die.</p><p>Final Fantasy XIII will definitely be a test for Japan.  Will a game that pure Japanese have the worldwide appeal that it's had in the past?  Will XIII inspire game development the way VII and X have before?  I really wonder if I'll enjoy it having given up on Japanese RPGs.</p><p>I think the only other games worth mentioning on Japan's horizon are <b>The Last Guardian </b>and <b>Legend of Zelda Wii</b>.  Everything else is just an unoriginal copy-cat.</p><div class='title'><b>The Rise and Fall of Japan</b></div><p>Also, 1up has an amazing article from Sept 2008 about <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938" title="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938">The Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Japan</a> that explains all this far better than I attempted.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, The Japanese have a word for it!</b></div><p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dragon Age &amp; Difficulty v.

| December 6, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Before getting a chance to play Dragon Age, one thing that several people mentioned about the game was it's difficulty.  "This game is hard!" exclaimed Nick Breckon of Idle Thumbs, "I've died so many times."  A friend of mine also concurred saying that he's died a whole lot in the game as well.  In both cases, they switched the difficulty down to easy just to make it through the game.  These people aren't novice video game players by any means, but was definitely curious.</p><p>Dragon Age is a game where your character has a few different classes to choose from.  You go about the game with a party of character that are different classes as well.  The game has 3 main classes to choose from: Warrior, Rogue and Mage.  And that's typical the order of how complex each character class is.  Warrior's are dirt simple.  You just walk up to an enemy and keep beating on it until it's dead.  Rogues are a little more tricky because they aren't designed for brute strength.  And Mages are typically the most complex because you have many spells to choose from.</p><p>It came as no surprise to me that all the talk I've heard about the game's difficulty were from people playing as a Rogue or a Mage.  Apparently if you're not playing the game to its fullest, it'll kick your ass.  This is why when presented with the choice of class, I went with the Warrior.  I don't want the game to be difficult to the point of frustration.  But I'm still not going to give the game the satisfaction of playing on Easy.</p><p>As playing a Warrior, I've found the game to be pretty damn easy, actually.  I haven't messed around with Tactics.  I accidentally spent my skill points on things that aren't useful.  I'm not paying attention to talents.  I haven't really tweaked anything to fight the most efficient fight.  I was almost never saving on my own.  And I'm still kicking ass, so I guess I must be doing something right.</p><p>At 15 hours into the game I experience my first death, and another hour later I ran into an actual challenge thanks to the Mage Circle.  But my deaths and problems were simply because I was going into the battle without thinking.  At this point the game had trained me to think any battle could be easily won.  For the first time, I had to change the way I approached the battle.  It only took me a couple minutes to utilize the shape shifting you have in the Mage Circle to defeat this cluster of mages and be on my way.</p><p>The game was still pretty much a cake walk until I came across Kolgrim today.  This phoney Spartan was actually the first real challenge I've face in this game.  My tactics of rushing into battle had no effect.  Even focusing on one enemy at a time ended in failure.  For the first time in the game, I was actually stuck.  There was no way I was going to work with Kolgrim and whatever quest he was on.  With the choices I wanted for my story, I would have to fight him and defeat him.</p><p>So, I started actually learning how to play the game correctly.  I looked into all the skills and talents for the first time, I had for my characters and came up with a battle plan that actually used them.  I looked at each character's tactics for the first time, too.  They were all defaults as aggressive to fight the nearest opponent.  What good is that going to do?  If my entire party focused on one enemy at a time, we can get rid of the weaker guys right away and only have Kolgrim left to deal with.</p><p>After just messing around with the options and coming up with an actual plan of attack, I had gotten far further in the battle than I had before.  Learning what the game has to offer, and utilizing it is the real difference between hitting buttons on the control and actually playing the game.  <b>If Dragon Age is "hard", then you're playing it wrong.</b></p><p>Unlike other RPGs, Dragon Age isn't some mindless level grind to overcome your strife.  It comes down to how you play the game, and developing strategies that work.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dragon Age PSA: &quot;Corrupted&quot; Save File" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dragon-age-psa-corrupted-save-file">Dragon Age PSA: "Corrupted" Save File</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Well, I managed to fuck up my Dragon Age save files.  This is on the Xbox.</p><div class='title'><b>Florida</b></div><p>This past Thanksgiving, I went down to Florida and visited my old pal, Justin.  Back in the day, when working at Toys R Us, we played a whole lot of video games together, and talked about them quite a bit.  We don't have identical tastes in gaming, but many of our favorites cross each others paths.  <b>Dragon Age</b> is definitely one of those games, and we spent a good amount of the weekend playing the game and talking about it.</p><p>Previously, I had played about 8 hours into the game, but I added another 10 hours after this weekend.  My human warrior princess saved the mage circle, completed the Shale DLC quest, helped Lelianna out with some personal issues, and then spent a lot of time with her in bed.  <b>Lesbian sex confirmed!</b></p><div class='title'><b>Downloadable Content</b></div><p>Justin had a couple pieces of DLC for Dragon Age on his harddrive, which automatically showed up in my game when I started playing.  My inventory automatically had that Dragon Armor, and a Memory Ring, which boosted experience.  Additionally, the Shale quest line and Warden's quest line opened up on the map.</p><p>I didn't have any of DLC for Dragon Age, since I was merely renting the game.  We had wondered what might happen when I return to my Xbox with all these new items and quests and things that I shouldn't have.  Well...  It labels your save as <b>CORRUPT</b>, that's what.  Even though, I was able to copy the files that contained those items onto my memory card, and even though those files weren't attached to a specific Gamer Profile, the game still didn't recognize them as correct.</p><p>I complained that I needed 4 pieces of DLC to run my save file.  Downloading the "Stone Prisoner" and "Warden's Keep" was an easy task to fix, since those are available on the Xbox Marketplace.  But, the "Dragon Armor" and "Memory Ring" are preorder bonuses.  They aren't available on the marketplace.</p><div class='title'><b>A Fix!</b></div><p>Some dudes are selling their preorder bonuses on eBay.  It didn't long for me to find the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=160381700577" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=160381700577">Memory Ring</a> and the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=250539259767" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=250539259767">Dragon Armor</a>.  And they really aren't that expensive.  So, I bought both of these a few hours ago.  I already got a reply from the Memory Ring guy.  I still need the Dragon Armor guy to respond with his code, and then I can play my save file on my console.</p><p>On the main menu of Dragon Age, there's a link for <b>Downloadable Content</b>.  Download codes are entered in here, rather than the Marketplace.  This also has a full list of all the Downloadable content available in this game.</p><p>If you decide to bring your saves around to your friends house's, <b>ensure that the items on this list match your own</b>.  If you have things on this list they don't, you won't be able to play your game.  If they have things on this list that you don't, and you decide to save your game, you will find yourself in the same situation I am.</p><div class='title'><b>No friends?</b></div><p>I guess Bioware expected that whoever was playing their game wasn't going to play it at a friend's house on occasion.  It's a real easy way to lock yourself out of the game, too.  Especially when these items and quests are automatically given to you the first time you log in.  I wonder how many other people have run into this issue, and if Bioware has some sort of solution to this.</p><p>Buying the quest DLC is easy enough, but those preorder bonuses are not available to the public anymore.  How are people supposed to get around that without Bioware issuing a bunch of codes?\</p><div class='title'><b>Dragon Age Online Profile</b></div><p>If you are bringing your Saved Data on a Memory Card over to a friend's house to merely show off your character, you can save yourself a couple steps.  Throughout the game, Dragon Age is sending information to Bioware's servers about everything you do in the game.  Things like complete character information, stats, story choices, achievements, etc.</p><p>Here's my Dragon Age profile: <a href="http://social.bioware.com/playerprofile.php?sku=dragonage1_xbox&amp;nid=2263281259" title="http://social.bioware.com/playerprofile.php?sku=dragonage1_xbox&amp;nid=2263281259">http://social.bioware.com/playerprofile.php?sku=dragonage1_xbox&amp;nid=2263281259</a></p><p>To look at your stuff, and sign up to see it, check out <a href="http://social.bioware.com&lt;/a" title="http://social.bioware.com&lt;/a">social.bioware.com</a>.</p><p><b><u><i>Update!!</i></u></b>: I got both codes from eBay, entered them, and my save files work again.  So, I guess that's what you need to do to fix this problem.  I'll probably play some more tomorrow night.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dragon Age Origins" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age Origins</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 24, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, I finally, FINALLY, got a chance to really start playing Dragon Age.  Dragon Age had been sitting on my desk all week, barely touched.  But my Sunday was wide open and void of responsibility, so I took the opportunity to relax in the war torn world.</p><p>Dragon Age is the latest game by Canadian developer, Bioware, the renowned western RPG developer. Dragon Age has been described a spiritual successor to <b>Balder's Gate</b>, Bioware's first established series a developer, but has no ties to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Dragon Age is a completely new IP, which is part of Bioware's company goal to create their own original games, rather than building off of established franchises, such as D&amp;D or Star Wars.</p><p><b>Jade Empire</b> was actually their first IP, but didn't really have the staying power they were hoping for.  <b>Mass Effect</b> was truly their first success on that front.  Mass Effect certainly wasn't my introduction to the Bioware name, but it was the first Bioware game I played and played through to completion.  I loved the environments, and space travel.  The story was pretty engaging, even though the actual character interactions were stoic and lifeless.  But I liked it a lot.</p><p>Dragon Age definitely learns from areas in Mass Effect that fell short, and expands several concepts that make Dragon Age a very well rounded and fantastic experience.</p><div class='title'><b>The Nameless, Speechless Main Character</b></div><p>In Dragon Age, you play a character that you create using a character creator, much like other recent western RPGs of this era (Oblivion, Fallout 3, Mass Effect).  You do not play a scripted defined main character.  Nothing makes me lose interest in a game faster than playing an absolute husk of a human.  At least in Mass Effect, you actually heard your character speak and interact with people.  In Oblivion, Fallout, and Dragon Age, you make your conversation choices but your character says nothing.  You basically play nothing...</p><p>Though, the point of this is to actually "role play" your character.  You make choices on your own and that shapes the story for yourself.  YOU define the character you play, rather than the writers.  The writers are there to merely give you the choices to either act like yourself, play the good guy, or play the bad guy.</p><p>This has never worked for me.  I never feel like I'm making a character.  I'm just making choices and am hardly ever reminded of the consequences.  Some stats go up, some stats go down.  There's no emotional attachment to anything I do.</p><p>But I don't feel unattached to my character in Dragon Age.  My character, who I almost named "Tina Fey", doesn't ever speak a word, but is constantly surrounded by a party of characters who speak their minds.  Every character I've met in Dragon Age has a distinct personality that is something I've never come across in a western RPG, but something you'd have a hard time NOT finding in a Japanese RPG.</p><p>With the choices you make throughout the story of Dragon Age, your party members remember.  When discussing an upcoming battle, or having trouble making a difficult decision, your party members will not hesitate to give their two cents on the situation, and even argue amongst themselves about what is best.  Sometimes you can join their conversation. Afterward, they may complain about it, and you can set them straight, or perhaps smack your self on the head at what a fool you were.</p><p>You may not have a voice of your own, but your party resonates with who you've become as a character and I find that rather engaging and amazing.</p><div class='title'><b>Choices</b></div><p>The choices you make are chiefly made through the conversations you have with other characters in the world.  Those choices found in Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Mass Effect were generally either "Good" choices, "Evil" choices, or "Neutral" choices, which generally make you a "Good", "Evil" or "Neutral" person.</p><p>The choices presented to you in Dragon Age are much more varied.  In fact, to prevent you from thinking in terms of Good or Evil, they've removed your alignment from the UI.  Choices might still be Good or Evil, but the game doesn't judge you in those terms.  Your party members do, though.</p><p>Each of the characters in your party has a Like and Dislike meter and the choices you make will either piss them off or make them think highly of you.  You can walk around with a bunch of the righteous characters and spread love and joy throughout the land.  Or you can surround yourself with assholes and fuck with people.  Or you can mix it up.</p><p>My party has two goodie two-shoes (Alastair, Lelianna) and one bad apple (Morrigan).  Morrigan will always complain when I decide to help out a villager in need.  "Oh god, are we going to help every single beggar that has a problem?  Don't we have more important business?"  But Lelianna can't get enough of it.  In fact, my friendship level with her is starting to get some special privileges, similar to what happens in Mass Effect if you start getting really close to a party member.</p><p>But there's more than just Good and Evil choices.  Good and Evil are only relative to your party members, and really depends on what they think you should be doing.  Some of these choices might be anti-religion or anti-royalty.  You can mind your manors and speak politely, or be a brass asshole.</p><p>For my character, I'm playing a princess whose castle has fallen and family has been completely killed.  Being a woman chosen as a Grey Warden, I'm not putting up with anyone's shit, but I'm still heading the manors I grew up with.  I will not show weakness in any case.  I'm here to prove that a woman will stop this war.  Girl Power!  Lelianna's with me...</p><div class='title'><b>Only 10 hours in...</b></div><p>I started the game bored off my ass, but after spending a good amount of time paying attention to the game and ignoring any distractions, it has totally pulled me in.  Dragon Age is very organic and genuine compared to Mass Effect, but I think both games emulate their environments.</p><p>Mass Effect has some amazing special effects, but deep down is missing the warmth of emotion.  The story focuses on all these things that are going on around you, but you are never affected by them.  No one ever says how they feel or expresses any emotion about the Geth invasion, or Saren.  There's nothing personal.</p><p>Dragon Age is all about the people in this world.  The Horde of Demons is almost identical to the Geth Invasion in Mass Effect, but the people you meet will always mention what they're feeling.  And you have enough dialogue choices that you can add to that conversation.</p><p>I hope the Mass Effect team and Dragon Age team have some cross design ideas that aided the development of both games because without these ideas, I think Mass Effect 2 will be a weaker game.</p><p>Anyways, Dragon Age is pretty great so far.  I just need another uninterrupted weekend day to spend 8 hours with it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Goroawase 語呂合わせ" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/goroawase">Goroawase 語呂合わせ</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, at work, I was talking with one of the project managers about the Konami Code.  We have <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/" title="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/">Flex Spy</a> setup in our Flex App, but we only want Users logged into the omni-user account to use it, and even then, we don't want it displayed at inappropriate times.  Why not implement the Konami Code?  When an omni-user keys in the code while using our app, it'll appear!</p><p>I think everyone in my age group knows what the Konami Code is, but might not necessarily know it by name.  This code showed up in almost all of Konami's arcade style games starting with the NES in the late 80s up through today.  The Konami Code is as follows...</p><p>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Select, Start.</p><p>I sent the project manager a link to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Wikipedia Page</a>.  After glancing over the article real quick, I noticed a little piece of information that solved a mystery that sat around in my head for years and years.</p><p><em>In Mobile phone games by Konami, B A are substituted with 5 7 3 on the numerical pad, which is the goroawase pronunciation for "konami."</em></p><p>573!  I have seen that number all over the place in Konami games.  I first noticed this when I saw that every single Konami Arcade game has a default high score of 57300.  I had no idea why that was significant, but it was consistent.</p><div class='title'><b>Goroawase</b></div><p>Goroawase uses the native Japanese reading (kun'yomi), the Japanese approximation of Chinese reading (on'yomi), and the English reading to describe a word in the form of a number.  The Wiki page has a wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">chart</a> showing each reading for each number.</p><p>The normal reading of 573 in Japanese is "go-shichi-san".  For 7 and 3, we want to use the native Japanese pronunciation, so it would be "go-nana-mitsu".  If we use the base kana for "go", and just the first syllables of 7 and 3, we get "ko-na-mi".</p><p>This is used in various places throughout gaming.  In Dance Dance Revolution, there's a Song called ".59".  In Japanese, the period is pronounced 'ten'.  So with that, the reading would be "Ten-go-ku", which translates as "Heaven" in English.  You might also know Japanese Video Game Designer, Suda Goichi, who writes his name Suda 51.  His name gets mispronounced all the time in the states as Suda Fifty-One.</p><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">Wiki Article</a> has a couple more examples that are interesting ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/games/12">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/games/10">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
