| November 17, 2019 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My absolute favorite video game soundtrack of all time is from Chrono Cross. It was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and had the perfect blend of atmosphere, mystery, and comfort. It perfectly complemented the dreamy and whimsical world of Chrono Cross.</p><p>This year is the 20th Anniversary of Chrono Cross, and to celebrate Mitsuda has gotten his band together to give a live tour of the Chrono Cross soundtrack. It will be performed 5 times in 3 cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.  Tickets were not so cheap at 16800<span class='ja'>円</span> (equivalent to $168), but it would be an absolute dream to hear my favorite video game music performed by the actual creator of the music. Easy buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Morning of the Concert</b></div><p>Prior to the concert, I met up with someone from the Internet who was also attending. We had our tickets reserved, but had to go to the venue early to actually get our tickets. Additionally, I wanted to visit the venue early because the merchandise booth was going to be open, too.</p><p>We went to the venue around Noon and waited for it to open. Plenty of other people were there, too. At 1:30pm, doors open but only a few people were allowed entry at a time. We eventually made it in at 2pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>At the entrance, we gave our reservations to the clerk, and they gave us our tickets. Inside were only a few people, and it was a line for the merch booth that curved around the room. </p><p>My goal was to purchase the concert towel for the event. In Japan, almost every concert or tour has a towel associated with it. It's kind of like a band's tour T-shirt in America. Tell 'em where you've been by buying a towel. The towel was 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> and I bought some stickers, too, for 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>. The tickets included a pamphlet of the concert, so I didn't buy that. Minutes after I purchased the towel, they were sold out, so I was able to get one in the nick of time. :)</p><p>We went back to my car to dump off our stuff, got some lunch, and went right back to the venue for the evening concert.</p><div class='title'><b>The Concert</b></div><p>We probably got back to the venue at 3pm or 3:30pm, and waited in line again. When the doors opened at 4pm, they were letting people in by sequential order of their tickets. Each individual ticket number was checked and let in by the order of when their tickets were purchased. You'd think this would take forever, but it went pretty quickly.  We made it in around 4:30pm, and the show began around 5:15pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The venue was tiny. Capacity was probably 1000 people? (as long as they were all smashed together) WAYYY smaller than the Tokyo or Osaka venues. It was nice, though. Much more intimate.</p><p>The band members took the stage in darkness, tuned their instruments, and the opening sequence for the concert began to play on the screen behind them. The dreamy motions of the title of screen of Chrono Cross. It detailed the preamble of the story.  And then, the heavy reverberations of the guitar being plucked as <b>Scars of Time</b> began, which moved into the light Flute.</p><p>It was incredible. It completely opened up my mind to hearing this music for the first time around 20 years ago when that first trailer dropped on the Internet, and when I imported the game on Playstation.</p><p>Mitsuda quickly introduced himself and the band as they played the opening menu music to the game. As "New Game" was selected, they played the battle music, which is how the game starts.</p><p>Overall, they played through the entirety of the game on the screen, and played the entirety of the soundtrack to accompany it.  I wrote down a rough setlist of what they played:</p><p><u>Main Set</u><br/>	1.	Chrono Cross - Scars of Time<br/>	2.	The Dream that Time Dreams<br/>	3.	Garden of God (Title Screen)<br/>	4.	Between Life and Death (Battle Music)<br/>	5.	Arni Village - Home World<br/>	6.	Arni Village - Another World<br/>	7.	Fields of Time - Home World<br/>	8.	Lizard Dance<br/>	9.	Termina - Another World<br/>	10.	Forest of Illusion<br/>	11.	Viper Mansion<br/>	12.	Gale (Boss Music)<br/>	13.	Victory (A Gift of Spring)<br/>	14.	Guldove - Another World<br/>	15.	Fortress of Ancient Dragons<br/>	16.	A Narrow Space Between Dimensions<br/>	17.	Dead Sea / Tower of Destruction<br/>	18.	Prisoners of Fate<br/>	19.	Magical Dreamers<br/>	20.	Zelbess<br/>	21.	Fate - The God of Destiny<br/>	22. Burning Orphanage??<br/>	23.	The Girl who Stole the Stars<br/>	24.	Frozen Flame<br/>	25.	Dragon God?? (Explanation for Elements. Screwing up, then Game Over)<br/>	26.	A Light for Lost Hopes (Game Over music)<br/>	27.	Life - Distance Promise (Elemental Song)<br/>	28.	Radical Dreamers - Unstolen Jewel<br/>	29.	Fragment of a Dream</p><p><u>Encore</u><br/>	1.	Song to get Mitsuda back on Stage<br/>	2.	Band Members Introduction Song<br/>	3.	Voyage - Another World??<br/>	4.	Voyage - Home World??<br/>	5.	Marbule - Another World</p><p>It wasn't like they just "played" the soundtrack to Chrono Cross. All of these were live variations of the original score. They deviated and mostly improved upon what they had before, and were able to match the crowd's reactions as they played. Much of the concert felt very interactive and Mitsuda explained a lot of his feelings and ideas for each song through the concert.</p><p>As the concert finished, there were credits on the screen, too. I have never been to a concert before with a credits screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Stuff</b></div><p>Concluding the show, this was all the stuff I came away with. I grabbed some of the heart confetti that were shot in the air during the concert, my light stick, and the things that I purchased earlier. Also included is a book of artwork we received as part of our ticket purchase. We also got a flame pendant, too, but that's not pictured here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Again, it was absolutely incredible and a dream come true to see, hear, and feel the music that has shaped my music tastes in video games. It was super dorky to rock out to RPG battle music. It was moving hearing Scars of Time and the other intro song live. And it was fun getting the audience to work together with their colored glowsticks to get the elements in the right order to get the true ending of the game/concert.</p><p>Mitsuda created an amazing concert, and with all of the production that went into the lights and video on display, I understand where the $168 price tag came from.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>With the conclusion of 2 additional final dates in Tokyo, Mitsuda has released an official set list from the concert.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" /></a></p><p>They also made an Apple playlist as well, so you can hear the music from the soundtrack.</p><p><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44" title="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44">https://music.apple.com/.../chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44</a></p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 12th, 2020</I></b></div><p>In a tweet, Mitsuda mentions that the final Nakano performance was recorded, and he is in the process of mastering the audio.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>As part of our ticket purchase, we were to receive a concert booklet of the event. We received an art book, but it was pretty short and didn't include anything about the concert itself. We filled out a card in order to receive this booklet later.</p><p>I got mine in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Calling this thing a booklet doesn't do it justice. In fact, this thing is thicker than most pre-order bonus art books. There are tons of photos from each of the events, interviews, sheet music, and logo designs. Almost all the production that went into planning the concert is included in the book.</p><p>This was BY FAR the most production value I've ever seen packed into a single musical event. In the beginning, it seemed like the concert was a huge expense, but it's clear how much love and care went into the event. Mitsuda clearly loves his music for Chrono Cross as much as his fans, and he loved this experience as much as we did.</p><p>It's an incredible memorial of the event.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - June 24th, 2020</I></b></div><p>This is the concert that keeps on giving. Today, Mitsuda and Procyon Studios released their recording of the final concert in Nakano Plaza. For only 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> on <a href="https://mora.jp/package/43000033/A86298/?fmid=TOPNEWRL01" title="https://mora.jp/package/43000033/A86298/?fmid=TOPNEWRL01">Mora</a>, you could download the complete concert in FLAC format. </p><p>I have been listening to this nonstop on repeat at work while I check student's writing. It's absolutely incredible to be able to relive this concert again and again.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 25th, 2021</I></b></div><p>Everyone said it was going to happen, and today Procyon and Mitsuda announced a live Bluray release of the final concert performance at Nakano plaza. </p><p>I purchased the limited edition version of the Bluray which comes with a download for an arrangement album of Chrono tunes, and some extra stuff.  This cost a total of 14100<span class='ja'>円</span>, which is a lot for a Bluray, but this'll be the very last Mitsuda can ring out of me from the concert. 14100 for the bluray, 16800 for tickets, and 2800 for merch. This totals 33700<span class='ja'>円</span>, or about $337.</p><p>It was totally worth it, though.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - April 15th, 2021</I></b></div><p>The preorder for the Bluray concluded on March 1st, and 6 weeks later, I was finally able to catch my deliveryman and get my Bluray.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It includes a full Dolby 5.1 surround sound experience of the concert with absolutely crisp audio and a full video recording of the event, too.</p><p>Also included is a short pamphlet of photos from the event, and a download code for the arrangement album. This arrangement is okay. I don't think it's as mind-blowing as the actual concert, but it's still a great listen. Much more low-key, too.</p><p>…And now, finally the saga is concluded. An absolutely amazing concert with many ways to relive and cherish those memories.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Games Mosiac (Top 18)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-games-mosaic">Favorite Games Mosiac (Top 18)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

As the overall mystery is uncovered, characters change and motivations make sense. It was the first game I played where death actually had meaning.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Snatcher uses both Blade Runner and Terminator to create a unique story of killer robots, Snatchers, killing and impersonating people. You play as Gillian Seed who had lost his memory and joined the Junkers, a police division which specializes in hunting down the Snatchers. Ultimately, the plot is uncovered and Gillian Seed gets more answers to his past. </p><p>Snatcher was Hideo Kojima’s second game as a sole director. The Sega CD version was the one I played back in the day. It was released in 1994 and was the 4th iteration having prior been released on PC-8801 (1988), MSX (1988), and Turbo CD (1992). This was the only American release, and it was complete with English voice acting and cutscenes. </p><p>The music is very futuristic 90s synthwave that matches the grimey, dirty, and metallic feeling of Neo Kobe City. As the story builds, the music builds with it. It was one of the first games I played where the music set a tense mood and atmosphere rather than just being background music. Snatcher’s sound and music was written and arranged by Akira Yamaoka. This was one of his first games, too. Later on, he would curate and write music for DDR, and ultimately move on to create the Silent Hill series.</p><p>I will always love Snatcher, and I don’t think I’ll ever knock it off my No. 1 position as my favorite game of all time.</p><div class='title'><b>My Favorite Games</b></div><p>As you can see from my list, my favorite games tend to be the ones that allow exploration of a massive world, have a compelling story with unique and distinct characters, and have a unique and memorable soundtrack that accurately compliments the setting, the gameplay, or the story. I tend to value those aspects over the actual gameplay.</p><p>It’s interesting to see how my favorites list has changed over the last few decades. You can view my list from 2007 below. Over time, I can’t really see this list changing much more. I think the top entries are pretty much set.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Horizon Zero Dawn" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It’s an absolutely beautiful game set in the far future after current society had already collapsed.  Roaming the lands are robotic animals that human civilizations hunt and harvest for parts to build and protect their villages.</p><p>From the moment it was first shown at E3 in 2015, everyone wanted to know more about it.  The concept looked interesting and unique.  Unfortunately, it’s release in early 2017 was completely blown away by The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.  On the surface, both games were an open world that lent itself towards exploration.  But Zelda had many aspects that innovated and expanded the genre compared to Horizon’s iterative approach.</p><p>But, unlike Zelda’s pure sense of exploration, Horizon’s strong sense of story fueled my exploration of the game’s world.  How did the world turn out like this?  Why are their robotic animals running around?  What is going on?  Underneath the lush beauty of nature are several metallic facilities of a futuristic society long dead.  Why?  And by the end, there are satisfactory answers to these questions.</p><p>Combat feels great.  Every beast you encounter has a weakness to exploit, or some specialized parts to harvest.  After a while, you are given enough equipment to take on these enemies in a variety of ways.  You can set traps, or blow off body parts.  Fire down arrows from safety, stealthily melee enemies from bushes, or just run in and attack directly.  It’s fun, and certainly challenging on higher difficulties.</p><p>Throughout my play through of the game, I stopped several times to use the photo mode and take a picture of the environment around me.  So many shots and scenes in this game is incredibly gorgeous, and the photo mode made everything come out great.  Every game should have a photo mode at this point.  Below are all the shots that I kept.  They include areas and scenes from the DLC, as well.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Final Fantasy XV" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It’s representation of women was poor.  And some sequences in the game required some patching and reworking from the developers.  But, I loved the music, setting, and, most of all, the main cast of characters.</p><p>From the beginning of the game, all the way through until the end, you play as Noctis and have your three friends, Gladiolus, Prompto, and Ignis, by your side at all times.  At the beginning, as a player, I didn’t really care for them.  In previous Final Fantasy games, the other cast members are just kinda there.  They have their one or two story moments, and for the rest of the game, they don’t talk or add anything to the experience.</p><p>In Final Fantasy XV, your three friends, the other party members, constantly talk about pretty much everything that’s going on.  Noctis doesn’t really say a whole lot unless it’s a pivotal story point.  I think most people get annoyed about this.  But after a while, it’s just the norm.  And their character shows through all of the interactions they have.  The friendship between the four characters isn’t really explained.  It’s felt.  It’s atmospheric.</p><p>For the first half of the game, none of this really has an impact.  You basically take your party members, your friends, for granted.  Then, at a certain point in the game, things change that impact your friendship.  They become quiet and sometimes scornful.  I was able to feel the magnitude of the decisions and consequences of the previous events through the change in atmosphere.  I had come to care for these characters, and now that things had changed.  It felt tense and sad.</p><p>And it wasn’t just getting passed what had happened or about trying to get things back to the way they were.  It was about living with the decisions that were made, and moving forward.  And moving forward together as a group, rather than breaking apart forever.</p><p>Being able to feel this connection to the characters and being able to relate to this kind of conflict through my own life was really powerful.  The localizers did an excellent job conveying this dynamic between the characters.</p><div class='title'><b>Photos</b></div><p>Anyways, one of the other great things about the game is the photographer of the group, Prompto.  Throughout play, he passively takes photos at somewhat random points.  When you take a rest at the end of the day, you can go through these photos and keep the ones you like.  Sometimes these photos even capture some glitches or bugs.</p><p>The following are all the ones I’ve kept.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Rom Hack Custom Box Art" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/rom-hack-boxart">Rom Hack Custom Box Art</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Since the Super Nintendo Mini displays everything in a visual way, every game needs a box art. So, I've made custom graphics for these games.</p><p>You can view them below along with a description, but you can download them all in a ZIP file here:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhrGHONO8y72HUyo5R0uX7QTTyRjRPOS" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dhrGHONO8y72HUyo5R0uX7QTTyRjRPOS">https://drive.google.com/.../1dhrGHONO8y72HUyo5R0uX7QTTyRjRPOS</a></p><div class='title'><b>Super Nintendo Mini</b></div><p>In summer, Nintendo announced the follow up to their massively successful NES Mini console, the Super Nintendo Mini. For people of my generation, the Super Nintendo is the absolute best console of all time, so it was poised to be an instant blockbuster. The game lineup seemed excellent, too.</p><p>They went on sale on October 5th at 10am as stores opened. I had an English one preordered, but I wanted to pick up a Japanese one, too. Between classes, I took off to the lesser known game store in town, and grabbed the last one they had at 10:20am.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4681.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4681.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4681_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4681_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4681_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4686.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4686.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4686_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4686_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_4686_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I owned an NES Mini, but I never really played it. There were some funs games, but the Super Nintendo was always king. The NES Mini had been hacked after its release so you could add your own games to it. It only took a week for people to get this working on the SNES Mini. It used the exact same security protocols and data structure, so it's was easy for them to figure out.</p><p>The funnest thing about the Nintendo Minis was the interface. Most retro devices just gave you a simple text list of games to choose from. Very sterile. The Minis have a rotating list of box arts which is a very visual ways of seeing all the games you have available.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171031_romhack_boxart/IMG_0581_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was no longer just a device to be able to play games. It was a way of visualizing your game collection. Putting your own favorite games on the system was an excellent way of building your own personal collection of the best games on the best console every made.</p><p>As mentioned above, you can do more than just add more games. Over the years, people have made many rom hacks of games adding in exploits or change characters. More modern rom hacks have gone further making almost an entire new game from existing assets.</p><p>Many rom hacks don't have their own box arts, and using the original game's box art didn't make much sense in a lot of cases. Thus, I had to create my own.</p><p><b>Note</b>: It should be stated that while I arranged each of the graphics, I did not create any of the artwork used in the images. Most of this artwork I found on the Internet, and was used in some way to promote the game. I wanted to create a homogeneous set of images that would fit in with original box art, but was still modern reflections of what the rom hacks did with the games. </p><p>If you are reading this and happened to create any of the artwork used, let me know, and I'll credit you. These were all meant for personal use, and are absolutely not meant as commercial products.</p><div class='title'><b>The Legend of Zelda and Super Metroid</b></div><p>The two best Super Nintendo games have tons of rom hacks, but these two are completely new experiences. <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/956/" title="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/956/">The Legend of Zelda Parallel Words Remodel</a> and <a href="https://metroidconstruction.com/hack.php?id=205" title="https://metroidconstruction.com/hack.php?id=205">Super Metroid Redesign Axiel Edition</a> are balanced versions of two hacks that completely change the map of both worlds, game physics, some items, enemies, and lots more.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Legend of Zelda Parallel Worlds Remodel.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Legend of Zelda Parallel Worlds Remodel.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Legend of Zelda Parallel Worlds Remodel.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Legend of Zelda Parallel Worlds Remodel.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Legend of Zelda Parallel Worlds Remodel.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Super Metroid Redesign Axeil.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Super Metroid Redesign Axeil.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Super Metroid Redesign Axeil.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Super Metroid Redesign Axeil.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/custom_boxart/SNES Super Metroid Redesign Axeil.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Mario Kart and Zombies ate my Neighbors</b></div><p><a href="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/162/" title="https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/162/">Mario Kart R</a> is a rom hack that has challenging modifications to all tracks in the game.

It's about a man wanting to distance himself from his life, taking a job as a forest lookout in the deep forests of Wyoming.  It takes place in 1989, one year after the great fire disaster of yellowstone park.  As this man, you live in the isolated wilderness, and try to find peace.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220144222.webp" /></a></p><p>Your only human contact throughout the game is your immediate supervisor, Delilah.  You are in constant communication with her over your two-way radio.  You're only introduction and interaction with her is talking.  She'll ask questions about your life.  You'll answer.  You'll make jokes.  Or you'll avoid answers.</p><p>It's like laying in bed late at night, talking with someone on the phone.  Your conversation is so close, and so personal.  But you're separated by a vast distance.  Because of this, Firewatch is probably the most human game I've ever played.</p><p>The only image you have of her, is her own lookout tower on the horizon, in the distance.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221120941.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the game, or the experience, that Firewatch tells.  Depending on how you open up to Delilah, or keep bottled up, determines the tone of the conversation through the game.  In the wilderness, the story of your character is told through self-reflection and analysis with your conversations of your only other human contact.</p><p>The visuals of the game convey this beautiful sense of freedom and liberty.  The music sets an atmosphere of tranquility and peace.  All of the main character's problems are back in the busy life of society.  All that responsibility can stay there, away from him.</p><p>On the surface, I think the game speaks to all of our back-seated desires to simply give up all of our responsibilities, and be free.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221130041.webp" /></a></p><p>Underneath the surface, the game begins to peel away those layers of freedom by praying on your idea of safety.  Early on, you run into another person stalking around at night.  In the second act of the game, you begin finding barriers and items in the woods that shouldn't be there.  </p><p>For me, my sense of paranoia began to build.  Can I really trust Delilah?  Is she telling me the truth?  Is she really there?  Is this all some social experiment to test me?  What can I believe?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221135906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221135906.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221135906.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221135906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160221135906.webp" /></a></p><p>This is where the actual story of the game begins to pick up from where the atmosphere and characters established in Act 1 had left off.</p><p>There are moments later on in the game that felt SO TENSE, but in reality there was nothing to fear at all.  It was like being afraid of your own shadow, or walking through your house in the dead of night.  There's nothing there.  You're alone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220173939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220173939.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220173939.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220173939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160221_firewatch/Firewatch_20160220173939.webp" /></a></p><p>I love this game a lot.

| January 29, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Witness is a beautiful and mysterious game by famed indie game developer, Jonathan Blow.  He’s been working on this game for the better part of a decade after the release of his debut title, Braid.</p><p>In The Witness, you explore an island held together by various kinds of line/circle puzzles.  The island has a variety of environments with their own versions of these puzzles.  Areas in the general world combine these different rules into more complex versions of puzzles you already know.  </p><p>Progression in the game is the transformation of yourself.  The game never explicitly teaches you how to do these puzzles.  Everything is learned by doing.  You are trained through a system of progressively difficult puzzles with each new rule set.  The world is open, as well, so you can begin anywhere you’d like and tackle any puzzle at any time.  But, if you haven’t experienced the rules for yourself, you might not know what to look for, or how to figure it out.</p><p>It’s an amazing journey.  It’s very satisfying to figure out how to solve puzzles, especially ones you’ve seen at the beginning and had no idea what to do at that time.</p><p>Though, it’s hard not to feel like a tourist when exploring the idea.  You are only able to interact with puzzles, and there are no people.  No living people, anyway.  There are some statues of people that can be interpreted as some kind of story, or hint.  There are voice recordings and some videos, too, but say nothing directly.  They are all quote and clips of renowned scientists talking about how we perceive ourselves and the world around us.</p><p>In the end, I think island is just an allegory.  The idea of a person just writing puzzles.  A person losing himself to art of writing the same puzzle over and over again.  And by writing these puzzles he encapsulates and isolates himself from the world, whether it be by accident or on purpose.  The act of solving all these puzzles isn’t to set him free, but to understand the corner he’s written himself in.</p><p>In that way, too, the idea of being a tourist still works.  You are basically just exploring the mind of a puzzle writer.</p><p>I guess the only revelation found through the game, it’s "braid-like" moment, (spoilers) would be naturally discovering that the accumulation of the puzzles have transformed the environment into a puzzle itself.  And once you begin noticing the line/circle puzzle in the environment, you begin looking everywhere for the hints of a circle so that it might complete another unseen puzzle.</p><p>In a way, the game transforms you again.  Well, it changed me anyway.  Becoming obsessed with these puzzles in the game bleeds into the real life.  Now, I see circles and lines everywhere and moving into a position where I could complete the puzzle.</p><p>The Witness is an amazing and unique experience.  Beautiful, mysterious, and brilliant.  It is definitely worth your time to play it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Change in Receiving Event Pokemon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/change-in-receiving-event-pokemon">Change in Receiving Event Pokemon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Though, unlike previous mystery gifts, you had to receive it via connection to the Internet, rather than local wireless..  which is somewhat curious.</p><div class='title'><b>Mystery Gifts</b></div><p>First off, there are 3 ways you can receive mystery gifts in the recent Pokemon games:  Internet, local wireless, and serial codes.</p><p>Serial Codes are new with the Gen VI games.  You input a 16-digital code.  The game verifies the code online.  And then it'll give you the gift.  There are two kinds of codes, too: unique and non-unique.  Unique codes are strictly one-time use.  Once the code is used, it can no longer be used by anyone.  Non-unique codes can be used once per game.  If code hasn't expired, anyone is able to receive that gift.</p><p>One nice thing about unique codes is that you can receive repeat events as long as you have multiple codes for that event.</p><p>Connecting to the Internet for gifts has been around since Gen IV.  If Nintendo is currently holding an event, just connect online, and receive the gift!  Simple.  Though, one thing to note is that is tied to whatever region your game is from.  US games can only download US events, and so on.</p><p>Gifts distribute via local wireless connections have been already since Gen III on the GBA.  Though at that time, you needed to own the wireless adapter.  To receive these gifts, you must be within proximity of the wireless network in order to make a connection, and download the gift.</p><p>Prior to that, there were other shenanigans required to receive gifts, but the always revolved on your showing up to the event in person.  The local wireless gifts are the modern evolution of that.</p><div class='title'><b>Gen VI Local Wireless Events</b></div><p>Japan has a shit-load of local events throughout the year where you can receive plenty of unique gifts that almost never come to the states.  As mentioned above, the current event is a Shiny Tyranitar.</p><p>Every local event in Japan has been region free for me.  I've been able to receive the event pokemon on both my Japanese games and US games.  Receiving these events have had an interesting effect, too.  Whichever region these Pokemon were received in, becomes the region of that Pokemon.  Even though these events are Japanese, receiving it on my English game creates an English Pokemon, rather than a Japanese one.</p><p>Though, for some reason, this method changed with this Shiny Tryanitar</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo Zone</b></div><p>At the Pokemon Center, rather than collecting the Tyranitar over local wireless, you had to connect through the Internet to receive it.  Specifically, your 3DS had to connect to the Nintendo Zone Wi-Fi network, and download the mystery gift through the Internet.  As I mentioned before, it's a curious change.</p><p>Through wireless, the only authentication done has been on the client-side, or on the 3DS itself.  The wireless signal simply broadcasts when the box is turned on, and does nothing else.  The 3DS searches for any signals.  When it finds one, it does a quick compatibility check, and then either accepts or denies it.</p><p>This new route has a lot more handshaking.  First, on the system level of the 3DS, it must connect to the Internet through the Nintendo Zone.  If the wireless mode is turned on, the 3DS does this automatically.  When connecting through the Internet, the 3DS will send a bunch of information about your game and 3DS through the Internet to Nintendo.  On the server-side, Nintendo will do all the authentication.  Then, Nintendo will decide whether or not to allow you to have the mystery gift.</p><p>One thing that Nintendo authenticates on the server-side is region.  I was not able to download the Tyranitar on the English version of game.  Only the Japanese version worked.  So, I was only able to get one mystery gift, instead of two.</p><p>Yeah, yeah..  boo-hoo, and all that.  But, it's a very interesting change.</p><div class='title'><b>Why?</b></div><p>Because of the region blocking, this allows the event Pokemon to retain their intended region.  The Tyranitar I downloaded from a Japanese event can only be a Japanese Pokemon now.  But, I think that's really just an unintended side effect.</p><p>Because of all the authentication done on the server-side and system level, this allows for a lot more security, which prevents any problems caused by piracy.  If you had some way of receiving the signal outside of the 3DS, now, there's no way you could download a million copies of the event Pokemon.</p><p>Additionally, this gives more control to Nintendo for distributing events.  Back at HQ, they only need to flip one switch on and off, rather than each distribution center having that power.  Everything can be handled at a central location.  Also, distribution centers need not worry about handling any extra hardware on their end.  Only the Nintendo Zone, which is really just a router.</p><p>Whatever the reason, it seems that Nintendo of America recently did this for their Hoopa distribution.  To receive that Pokemon, you had to connect through Nintendo Zone at McDonalds.</p><p><u>Update (3/18)</u>: There's an event going on right now for a Shiny Ho-oh at Pokemon Centers.  But for this event, it goes through Wireless, rather than Internet.  I figured that would continue with the Internet going forward, but I guess they went back to wireless.  Weird.. why?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Castlevania 2 Simons Quest (Japan)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/castlevania-2-simons-quest-japan">Castlevania 2 Simons Quest (Japan)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 16, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Recently, I've been playing a lot of Castlevania 2 on the 3DS Virtual Console.</p><p>As a kid, I thought this game was absolutely impenetrable, but after seeing some other people playing it, and looking at a map of the world.  It's actually not that bad.  In fact, it's probably the easiest Castlevania ever made.</p><p>I bought and played through the US version.  After I finished it, I wanted to try out the Japanese version, so I downloaded that on my Japanese 3DS.  There are some interesting differences.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/castlevania2/zlCfzS9kQUMdcJ12Pz.webp" /></p><p>First off, when it was originally released in Japan, Castlevania 2 was a Famicom Disk game, rather than a cartridge.  The 3DS game emulates the loading effects of the game, too, so every time to switch areas in the game, it's accompanied by a 3-4 second loading screen.</p><p>Also, the music is absolute trash.  It the same music as the US version, but without several added "instruments" that create the iconic tracks everyone knows from the game.  It's really weird listening to it.  </p><p>The Japanese version sounds and feels so incomplete.  It's so weird that they completely dropped the ball on the translation for the US version.  They clearly spent time fixing the other problems with the game.</p><p>Along with the translation, the ending of the Japanese version is WAY more complete, and actually features credits!  The US version just mentions a few mistranslated things, and ends.</p><p>Here's the full good ending to the Japanese version for comparison:</p><p class='img'><img
