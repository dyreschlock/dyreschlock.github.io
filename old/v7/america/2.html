You may have heard of that day when it stormed and stormed and stormed so much that the dam holding back all the water in the man-made lake burst and completely drained the lake.  Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0bVsSWXG-I" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0bVsSWXG-I">clip</a>.</p><p>A month and a half has past as the bottom of the lake has been completely exposed to the July heat.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1597.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1597.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1597.webp" /></p><p>It took me a little while to find somewhere I could park and take a closer look at.  Eventually I found a book landing and was able to walk along the bottom of the lake.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1650.webp" /></p><p>You can't even drive to the edge of the water anymore.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1601.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1601.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1601.webp" /></p><p>It was incredibly eerie to walk along the bottom knowing that the water level is supposed to be one or two feet above my head.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1605.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1612.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1616.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1623.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1623.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1630.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1630.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1630.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1646.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1646.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1646.webp" /></p><p>The bottom of Lake Delton was mostly a sandy surface.  It was just like walking on a beach.  There was a bit of a stream running through the sand.  I took off my sandals, rolled up my pant legs and walked around in the water a little bit to get some close up pictures.  The water was cool compared to the warmed up sands.</p><p>However, I was incredibly careful...  The entire time I was thinking about <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc" title="http://youtube.com/watch?v=HLgADgqZpHc">this youtube video</a> and another video of a guy sinking in mud or quicksand really fast and completely vanished.  I thought of these when I was slowing sinking in the sand while walking in the water, but it hadn't happened the entire time out there.  Until, I stopped thinking about it...  and sunk down past my knees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_lakedelton/IMG_1641.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't running or anything, so I was right near the edge of the solid sandy surface and the mud pit, so pulling myself out was pretty easy.  The whole time I kept slowing sinking down and kept saying to myself, "stop stop stop stop stop...  holy crap."  Luckily I had already taken my sandals off or I probably would've had to buy new ones.  Though my sandals probably kept my "afloat" longer having a larger area to step on rather than the thin area my feet cover.</p><p>I didn't stray too far from shore after that. ^_^</p><p>Anyways, Lake Delton is pretty screwed..  It probably looked like hell after it initially drained with all the dead fish corpses and more perilous mud pits.  There's a new article today that said crews are beginning to repair the dam this week, so it might be fixed by next year.  I wonder what it'll look like in winter.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Leinenkugel's" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/leinenkugels">Leinenkugel's</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 21, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There was one other stop I made on the way home from Minneapolis and that was in Chippewa Falls to see how Zach was doing.  Zach got a fancy internship at Cray Computers for the summer, but has found that working in the middle of nowhere leads to much loneliness.  I saw Dark Knight with him on the way up, and with a beautiful sunny Sunday afternoon ahead of us, we went to the Leinenkugel's Brewery which is also in Chippewa Falls.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1578.webp" /></p><p>It was quite quaint but also pretty fancy too.</p><div class='title'><b>Leinie Lodge</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1572.webp" /></p><p>The main public facility in the Leinie Lodge which is a big gift shop and also the place to sign up for a tour of the brewery itself.  Inside they had tons of crappy merchandise.  They put the Leinie logo on nearly everything..  from postcards to notebooks to fishing tackle to shirts to chairs to rulers to hold punchers to anything really.</p><p>It was really annoying because it took me forever to find a keychain bottle opener to match my New Glarus one.  I should've picked up a pint glass to match my New Glarus ones too, but I didn't think of it.  It doesn't really matter though, since those glasses were kinda ugly.</p><p>We signed up for the tour and off we went an hour later.</p><div class='title'><b>Brewery</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1587.webp" /></p><p>This here is the main bottling facility which is where 100% of the tour went.  We went up and down the elevator a couple times to the 4 floors that serviced the actually creation of the beer.  The mixing of the hops, wheat and all that crap I wasn't paying attention to..</p><p><b>Fact</b>: They still add their active and flavoring ingredients by hand during the process, which allows them to still fall in the category of a Craft Brewery.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Also, they employ less than 52 workers at any given time to also keep this status.</p><p>We went got outside and went into another portion of the building that serviced bottling and then shipping.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: Every single bottle or can or keg produced by the brewery has been ordered in advance. They never make more than what is already spoken for.</p><p><b>Fact</b>: A good chunk of their workers are hired help for the summer from local colleges.  This is why they have a bunch of summer and fall beers, but not many winter and spring beers.</p><p>I learned a few things, but that was pretty much it.  It was a neat tour and the tour guide was cute.  Zach started talking with her quite a bit as the tour ended about this and that. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Comparing tastes...</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1585.webp" /></p><p>The whole area of the brewery was really nice.  Plenty of trees throughout the facility, and a babbling brouk passing between the Leinie lodge and the Brewery.  It was more pleasant than the other two brewerys I've been to.</p><p>The New Glarus Brewery is alright..  but it's really small.  The tours are self guided, so you can show up at anytime and walk through the place.  They give you a little phone thingy you can punch numbers into when you see them on the wall, but it's all rather useless info.  The giftshop had useful things and actually sold the beer, though.</p><p>Times are changing though, as New Glarus has just expanded to open up their much larger facility on the other side of the town.  From the road, it looks probably just as big as the Leinie brewery.  They still plan on keeping their original brewery open for their craft beers, but will use the new facility for more mass production.</p><p>The other brewery I've been to is the Asahi Beer Factory in Fukuoka, Japan, which is absolutely different than these two.  The Asahi Brewery is massive.  Bigger than most Wal*marts I've been to.  The production is super fast and their volume is huge.  It definitely lacked the heart of our wisconsin brewerys, though..  Also, I couldn't understand what the hell the guide was talking about.</p><div class='title'><b>Local is better</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1590.webp" /></p><p>Overall, I'd say this has been the best Brewery Tourery I've been on.  The Leinie's brewery has a lot more history than New Glarus but still keeps everything down to earth.  I still like New Glarus' Spotted Cow over anything that Leinie's has, but Leinie is a great goto beer.  You can find it nearly everywhere and it never lets you down. ^_^</p><p>Leinie's Octoberfest beer should start showing up at retailers in the next few weeks, so that'll replace Spotted Cow for me for a little while. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure what other brewerys I'd like to check out next..  maybe I'll go to Ireland and check out Guiness or something.  I'd like to go back to the Asahi Beer factory and get a keychain bottle opener to match my other ones.  I'm sure I'll find myself somewhere.</p><p>As another note, Zach and I came across a tanning salon with a must hilarious name:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080720_leinen/IMG_1596.webp" /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tampa storms" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tampa-storms">Tampa storms</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 7, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Man, it can really storm in Florida when it wants to.  It just so happens that July is the pinnacle months for heavy thunderstorms.  The heavy weather is brushed from the Atlantic and flows directly over the state and back out over the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>It was really clear on July 4th, but these last few days have been graced with lightning, thunder, and torrential rains.  With Tampa Bay to our east, you can see the rains coming from miles away before it's finally on top of you.  Off in the distance, the clouds will flash and growl.  A few minutes later, streaks of lightning appear parallel to the several skyscrapers on Tampa in the distance.  A few minutes later, part of the horizon disappears with a mess of gray.  The rain literally pulls the cloud into the water.  A few minutes later, the gray blob engulfs more of the horizon and lightning fires out of the clouds into the blob, up and around the blob.  The white light dances horizontally through the sky before finding a spot to land.</p><p>Several minutes have passed and the view of the east-side is completely obstructed, but it's still really light on this side.  On our side, the sky's mostly overcast with patches of sun shining through.  There's a clear division of light and dark ripping through the sky almost right above our heads.</p><p>About half an hour later the storm finally hits us and that blurry gray mess blending sky and ground shows itself to us first hand.  The rain is relentless, pounding and soaking the ground.  The excess rain floods the highways, the streets, everything.  Rain everywhere.</p><p>This really isn't anything all that new to us in the Midwest though.  We already had these types of storms throughout the month of June that completely ripped through farmlands, streets, cities and anything.</p><p>We were driving around in this storm and got back last night.  It let up quite a bit at that time, so I decided to walk around in the rain.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1453.webp" /></p><p>The streets and sidewalks had already been super-heated from the sun earlier in the day, so the water was very warm.  Walking around barefoot in the large puddles surrounding both sides of the street, felt like walking in a pool or a man-made lake.  I guess the rain was heated from the sun beating down on the tops of the clouds.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1458.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1458.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1458.webp" /></p><p>The beach was equally warm.  Tip-toeing across the warm rocks, unto the rough warm sand, walking into the smooth warm muddy sand in the warm waters..  The only thing cold about this rain was the walking through the grass to get to the beach.  The rain itself wasn't really all that cold either.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1476.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1476.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1476.webp" /></p><p>Well, I guess the other cold about the rain was getting back inside the house to the frigid air conditioning.</p><p>The next day, today, the sun pierced the sky and made quick work of any evidence left by the rain.  Only to have the rains bring heaven to earth again a couple hours later.  So, now I'm waiting in the airport for my flight which is still on time, admit several other flights which have been canceled or delayed until tomorrow.  Lucky!</p><p>Anywho, Tampa is pretty rad.  I also made Justin take me to the Green Iguana Saturday Night for Richard Vision and Ybor City during Sunday afternoon for sight seeing.  These two events probably should've happened in reverse order since I found out that Ybor City is the heart of Tampa's nightlife.  I bought a pretty slick record at the DJ shop. ^_^  Here's the Czar Vodka Bar which will definitely bring me back here before the end of the year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1433.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1433.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, Justin isn't much of a bar-hopin', dance goin' fella, but that's understandable since the last 10 years have been akin to chaos living in the Army, shipping to Iraq twice, and two kids that constantly demand attention.  Not too mention, they're still in the process of unpacking their belongings in their new home.  A welcome couple hours of peace online or on xbox is his idea of vacation.</p><p>Whereas my life at the moment is fairly boring, calm and void of chaos.  Especially now that I don't have to live with Dave and Gage's band practicing a night or two a week.  My home is a calm center that tears down stress of work.  A peaceful grove to watch TV shows, play games, occasionally read and casually work on errata.  Ughh..  that sounds WAY too "Men are Mars, etc" for me to bear, but it's true.</p><p>Anywho, Heading out to bars and clubs is a welcome surge of energy to break up the stillness.  Though, it's mainly because of the music and the beer.  Speaking of Beer, I have found the most delicious Floridian beer during my 4-day stay here at Tampa:  Land Shark Lager.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1479.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1479.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1479.webp" /></p><p>It's very smooth like Corona, but has a tasty crispness that doesn't make it taste like Crap/Corona.  I drank a ton of the stuff.  It would probably taste even more amazing with a slice of lime or lemon, but it doesn't need it.</p><p>...And to get back to the original conversation, here's a couple other notable places found in Ybor city.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1435.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1435.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1436.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1436.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1438.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1438.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1438.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080706_ybor/IMG_1447.webp" /></p><p>That last shot was taken facing west about an hour before it rained and the chronological beginning of this post.</p><p><em><b>Post-Flight Update</b></em>:  Well, I must've jinxed that whole "on-time" remark as my plane came in nearly 2 hours later than I had hoped.  But, I arrived back in Madison in one day and nearly finished my book, so I can't complain ^_^.  Also, It's raining a bit here at the moment, so it seems I've traded one storm for another.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Thinking about Florida" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/thinking-about-florida">Thinking about Florida</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 5, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm in a different world down here.  Not one radically different than the world of Wisconsin, but a much different climate which has altered the thoughts and practices behind the development of the Floridian society.  Houses built for heat rather than cold.  Flamingos and White Cranes stalk the beaches, rather than black birds eying grassy plains.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1363.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1363.webp" /></p><p>Cheese doesn't really exist down here, which makes me sad..  but my disappointment is immediately expunged at their abundance of crab, salmon, and other delicious seafood.  The heated climate also gives birth to a beautiful variety of fruits, some strange, some familiar.  I don't need String Cheese for a snack, when I can pick up a Mango or quickly fry up some super-cheap salmon fillet.  Also, I think if you're going to eat mangos raw, use a knife rather than sinking your teeth into it.  Maybe mine was not ripe, but it was much tougher than I thought.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1359.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1359.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1359.webp" /></p><p>Most of you know this, but I came down to Florida to visit my friend in the military, Justin.  With my 10-year High School Reunion only 2 weeks away, It has really been 10 years since he decided to join the service out of high school and has been jumping back and forth between different trainings and posts.  Along the way, he started a family and has 2 kids, Alex (3) and Eric (1).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1351.webp" /></p><p>Little children are an interesting specimen.  No matter how righteous or enlightened you think you are, you were once this frail little person that does absolutely nothing with their time.  I'm a strong believer that environment is the key resource to how a child is shaped into the adult they become and the environment is larger what you put into it because they learn by watching you.  The bigger influence you are in their lives, whether it be interaction, your environment, or your decisions, the more they'll become you later in their life.  Eh, but what do I know on the subject anyways, right?</p><p>Anywho, Florida is like an oven.  During the day, the heat lamps are turned on and bake all the houses and roads and trees.  It fills the earth with hot energy.  But the people of Florida do everything to rid themselves of the heat.  You walk around outside in 80, 85 degree heat, and enter a 65, 70 degree freezer every place you go.  The chillness is an instant break from the humidity, but after a while you need a break from the cold.  I think that's just expectations, though.  I expect to be dying from the heat, but instead, I'm freezing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080704_florida/IMG_1360.webp" /></p><p>The Floridian night has been my favorite part of the day because the heat lamps turn off and the humidity fails.  The ground is still retains the heat from the course of the day, so your bare feet are never too cold.  The air is still warm, but holds a soft breeze.  It's not a chilling breeze or a cool breeze..  just ventilation really.  Movement.</p><p>The sand of the Tampa beach is soft and fine.  Walking along the receded shoreline feels more like tracking through mud than the beaches you'd find in the Midwest.  I guess that's the difference of the sea's massive unrelenting waves savaging Florida, rather than the relative stillness of lakes.  It's very soothing between my toes, which completes the entire scene on the beach here.</p><p>The vacant beach.  The oozing sand massages my feet.  The gentle warm breeze tickles the hairs on arm.  The soft constant waves brush against my shins.  And surrounded by a theater of fireworks in the distance.  The pop, pop, pop and the brilliant flashes sparking and twinkling.  It looks like a thin strip of Christmas lights along the horizon of the beaches across Tampa Bay with the few skyscrapers also lit up.  Serenity graced with a stripe of chaos.</p><p>Romance comes to mind.  Sharing this calm moment with a significant other.  I wasn't alone though as Justin had been following me, and we'd been talking about our lives and what we thought of our positions in life.  Where to go, what to do...  Those type of questions.</p><p>Anywho, today is another day in the oven state and walking around on the sloppy beach sounds like a good idea, I might wait until sun fall though so it's not other cooler, but holding a couple beers doesn't set off any warning bells of public intoxication.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 35W Update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/35w-update-2">35W Update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The new bridge looks absolutely beautiful, ESPECIALLY compared to the piece of shit old one.

It's not completely smashed and the wheels are still in perfect shape, but the tank itself is slightly dented like you were squeezing a pop can.  It's been destroyed with such gentle force compared to the other one.  Like an elephant or a giant brushed up beside it.</p><p>Anyways, this whole scene would've been more surreal if this security guard wasn't watching me the whole time as I crossed over the police "Do Not Cross This Line" yellow banner and walked around for 10 minutes.  And then all these police sirens went off and I took off running.  I like that last photo, but I probably could've taken some better ones.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Devil's Lake" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/devils-lake">Devil's Lake</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I really needed to get up to UW-Eau Claire and retrieve my bowling ball, which was in my little brother's possession, and while together, we decided to go the extra couple of driving hours to reach Minneapolis.</p><p>Today on the way, we stopped off in downtown Minneapolis and took a look at something I didn't get around to doing when I was home last time.  I think that was around 2 months ago.</p><p>We took a look at what was left of the 35W bridge that had collapsed into the Mississippi River on that July Thursday evening around 6pm.</p><p>Parallel to the 35W bridge is another bridge about 200 feet away that connects part of the yuppie downtown area to dinkeyville and the UofM on the other side of the river.  We ended up parking a block or two away from the north foot of that bridge in the fraternity sector of campus and begin to make our way south along the bridge overlooking the disaster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" /></p><p>Here's the northern foot of 35W, collapsed into a train yard.  Those two train cars were udderly crushed from the weight of the bridge and its rush hour inhabitants.  Here's a closeup:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" /></p><p>There were two very large chunks of the bridge still left for disposal.  The closest chunk used to lay atop one of the shelves at the base of the river.  When I first saw this chunk, i thought, "jesus.. no wonder this crappy bridge feel apart."  Honestly, that bridge has got to be the most brittle construction job ever done.</p><p>It looks like 35W was nothing but a thin slap of concrete stretching all the way across the Mississippi being held up by a couple steel beems balancing on 3 or 4 raised shelves.  This bridge should've been torn down years ago and replaced..  I guess time did that for them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0469.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0478.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0483.webp" /></p><p>Further down, all the metal beems that linked itself to this whole chunk were absolutely warped, crushed, bent, squished, etc..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0471.webp" /></p><p>In the river, another team was worked on pulling part of the bridge emerged in the water.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0477.webp" /></p><p>and further on in that picture is that other most solid chunk left of the wreckage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0482.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0484.webp" /></p><p>It's really bizarre to think that a heavily used highway was there only 2 months ago.

| August 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, Mitsuwa had their annual Bon Odori Dancing festival.  The Bon festival is typically the festival of the dead that which citizens remember their loved ones.  Nagasaki has a pretty elaborate Bon festival that spans 3 days.  One of the shrines from Suwa Shrine is brought down to the Harbor where it is clearly visible for the spirits to gather and collect amongst the living.  Loved ones can go to the Harbor and see their loved ones who had died over the past year.  On the third day, loved ones light a candle in a little paper boat and send it down the river to guide the spirit through the River Styx.</p><p>Something like that anyways..  This was one festival, I wish I was still over there to see.  Bon festivals take place towards the end of Summer.  Typically sometime between the end of July and the beginning of September.  Nagasaki's Bon festival takes place in the middle of august.  Around the same time, St. Paul, Minnesota also celebrates Nagasaki's Bon festival, since they are "sister cities," which makes it a great excuse to go home and visit my parents.</p><p>Anywho.. Mitsuwa changes this a little bit by adding 'Odori', which is 'to dance.' Mitsuwa's Bon Odori festival was more of the celebration of life, than the remembrance of the dead.  I wonder what region this change originated from.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" /></p><p>Mitsuwa had a pretty damn big turnout.

No squid on a stick, though :/</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" /></p><p>The real show was the stage outside in the parking lot.  They switched off between traditional japanese stuff, and uninspired contests.  They had Chicago's professional Taiko Drummasters, and Chicago's Okinawan dancers.</p><p>I was really disappointed they didn't have Soran and Yosakoi.  These were the two traditional dances that Maki, Mika, Natchan, and Mayu taught us foreigners.  Perhaps, in one years time, I will assembled a Soran team of my own and bring this time honored tradition to Mitsuwa.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun.  It was really cute to see so many kids having a great time, and it was great seeing everyone in a festival type mood.</p><p>They really need more food vendors and parlor games to bring the essence of a japanese festival to life, though.  I guess too many people have real jobs.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/america/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/america">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (24)
