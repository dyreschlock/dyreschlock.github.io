Basilicas are a special designation of catholic church only given this status by the Pope himself. Groundbreaking began in 1907, and the church was officially opened in 1914. Pope Pius XI then bestowed this status on the church in 1926. Later in 1975, it was designated as an official historical landmark.</p><p>The church has still stood for over 100 years, and has become a regular landmark of the Minneapolis landscape when coming from the west on Hwy 394. It is located right next to the junction of 394 and 94, so it's always visible to the tens of thousands of people traveling through the heart of Minneapolis.</p><p>As such, my nieces have seen this building everything they go home from my mother's (their grandmother's) house. I think the littler of the nieces said she wanted to live there someday? In one of my final few days of my American trip, we all went to the cathedral to walk around. After, we went to the outdoor exhibition area of the Walker Art Center.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Moon in America" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-moon-in-america">The Moon in America</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In European cultures, handed down to America, we had always viewed this image as a face, dubbing it The Man in the Moon. However, in Japanese history (and also China and other Asian countries), they don't see a face. They see a rabbit. Since living here and looking at the moon, I see it, too. It always looks two ears flopped over a crouching body fit into a circle. </p><p>I once read somewhere that claimed part of the difference of opinion was because the angle of moon when viewed in Japan was different when viewed in America. In Japan, the moon was rotated counter-clockwise which put the rabbit's ears up a bit higher, making the rabbit more distinguishable. This seemed like nonsense because Japan and America are on the same latitude. The moon doesn't spin that way.</p><p>One night while in America visiting family, there was a beautiful clear night. A few clouds, but the moon is full and illuminated the darkness. I wanted to photograph proof of this difference.</p><p>Here's the American moon shot in August 2025.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" /></a></p><p>And here's the Japanese moon <a href="/old/v7/super-moon" title="/super-moon">shot in November 2016</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It is rotated by quite a bit! </p><p>But... this rotation could be because of a lot of things.

| July 31, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When I was back in the US, I visited Madison for only a brief 8 hours before moving on. I visited State St and the Square and was shocked at how much the place had fallen apart, due to a combination of Covid and people working from home. Stores were boarded up and gone. They were in the process of tearing down some buildings. And homeless folks were everywhere.</p><p>There were always homeless people in Madison, but they were among the many other people walking around, working, and living in the area. Now, it felt empty and ravaged. I don't think the downtown area of Madison was the only place in America that has fallen apart in recent years. (Visiting the city during a rainstorm probably also contributed to the gloomy atmosphere.)</p><p>Anyways, one of my destinations in Madison was to visit where I used to work, Widen Enterprises. After graduating university, I worked for Widen Enterprises as a Software Developer for over 7 years and then worked abroad for them a litlte bit after coming to Japan.</p><p>Widen Enterprises had a history of print which began in the 40s. They first began detailing and manufacturing plates for newsprint and then broke into catalog printing in the 60s. In the 90s, they invested in developing a user interface and backend that would aid their customers and building these catalogs. This move was perfect syngery with their printing service.</p><p>However, with the Internet becoming more and more ubiquitous, print died and their software division grew considerably. During my years of working there, the printing division became smaller and smaller. The basement used to have huge printers for all their costumer's catalogs. As company's workflows moved online, less and less were printing and these printers just took up space. Just after I left, I think the entire print division was disbanded.</p><p>Widen's Digital Asset Management system grew to become their main focus and now it had become their only focus. When I began work there, we occupied half of the top floor. After I left, the building was remodeled and development took over the entire ground floor.</p><p>Even before the Covid years, I think many developers and staff worked from home at least one day a week. And then during Covid, I think everyone switched to remote working. Not uncommon for companies in the US.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, in September 2021, they sold the company to Acquia. Acquia's main product is a line of content management software for your enterprise website. Having a digital asset management system is powerful tool to allow your costumers to host all their product images and use their software to build their corporate website or commerical website around it.</p><p>Over the 4 years of ownership and looking at some staff listsing at Acquia, it looks like much of the brilliant excellent folks at Widen have been moved into more senior roles within Acquia. From other rumors, it seems like much of Widen's staff has either been absorbed into other areas of Acquia or left the company altogether.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the old Widen building is for sale. It is no longer used by any developers or staff still working on DAM, wherever they may be. I think Widen had been at this location since the late 60s or 70s? Some of the other print buildings in the area still look like they're in business. It seems like a blight to have one of the major businesses in the area gone.</p><p>Someone had recently mowed the lawn, so it doesn't look too bad. But there are still some overgrown plants around the parking lot. Nobody comes here. (The overgrowth is much more present on Google Street View.) I'm not sure when they sold the building. Maybe it was still being used in late 2023?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While I was in the US, I drove past many corporate buildings and businesses that were completely empty because of the workforce moving online. I'm not a fan of working from home, but my commute to work is only 5 minutes in this dense mountain town. If I had to drive 45 minutes to work every day in a dense metro traffic, I would probably prefer working from home, too.</p><p>While everything feels like it's falling apart in the states, I think it's a consequence of transitioning the next (or another) form of our society. And change hurts.</p><p>It still <a href="/old/v7/toys-r-us-is-dead" title="/toys-r-us-is-dead">sucks that another one of my former workplaces is gone.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to St Croix River Riverboat" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/st-croix-river-riverboat">St Croix River Riverboat</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The plastic covers hooked to the very top shelves for signage and concealing extra product.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp"></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp"></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Even though they are painted white, the peg hooks are identical as are all of the price labels on them.

I'm pretty sure that the mall locations don't have the same shelves and aisle fixtures. At my Toys R Us (25 years ago), each section of the aisle with those shelves were 4 feet across. "Merchandise the aisle 4 feet at a time," the old manager would say. I should have brought a tape measure to check if these shelves were 4 feet, but it definitely seemed like it. Japan uses the metric system, so I'm guessing the locations in the malls use more standard Japanese shelves. They wouldn't have defaulted to 4 feet.</p><p>Looking at Google Earth, this Toys R Us was here in 2001, which was back before the International Division broke away from the American parent. Much like Costco does today, they probably manufactured all of these shelves, fixtures, and equipment in America and shipped it overseas. In the last 20 years, there was probably no reason to throw out all of this stuff in order to remodel.</p><p>This North Nagoya location feels like an island in many ways. It feels like an island in time, obviously. But there's nothing else around the area, either. You HAVE to drive to get here, and specifically drive to this location. With nothing else around, this isn't really an impulse stop. There's plenty of parking. The roof is a parking lot, too!</p><p>Despite my photos, many families still come here looking for toys, bikes, and other baby gear. It took me a while to get some photos without people. Actually, I never took photos of the bike area because there was always someone there. So, this location must still be pretty profitable. Makes sense if they're not actually spending any money updating the infrastructure.</p><p>I don't know if the trip to this location would actually be worth it, but if you have deep nostalgia for Toys R Us in the 2000s, and you happen to be driving north out of Nagoya, it could be worth a stop. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Toys R Us is Dead" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/toys-r-us-is-dead">Toys R Us is Dead</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Now, 18 years later, my store has been closed for good. Obviously the rise of the Internet economy slowly chipped away at Toys R Us's market share, but the real death move began in 2005 when <b>Bain Capital</b> bought the company. </p><p>In 2005, Bain Capital and KKR bought Toys R Us for around $6.6 billion. In order to pay for this sale, that put up some cash, but they mostly shifted debt that they already owed into Toys R Us in order to cover the rest of the cost. In more detail, Toys R Us already had about $1 billion debt at the time of sale. Bain Capital and KKR payed $1.3 billion, and shifted $5.3 billion in debt into Toys R Us. As such, Toys R Us was now around $6.3 billion in debt and only valued at $6.6 billion. It was damn near bankrupt immediately. How is this legal? Or possible?</p><p>[ Citation: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/06/business/toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/" title="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/06/business/toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/">https://www.marketplace.org/.../toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/</a> ]<br/>[ Citation: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/09/20/toys-r-us-is-a-lesson-in-how-bad-assumptions-feed-bad-financial-planning-creating-failure/?sh=228d6eaa58ea" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/09/20/toys-r-us-is-a-lesson-in-how-bad-assumptions-feed-bad-financial-planning-creating-failure/?sh=228d6eaa58ea"> https://www.forbes.com/.../toys-r-us-is-how-bad-assumptions-create-failure</a> ]</p><p>Toys R Us was still rather profitable, and could still stand against other retailers. But with its monumental debt, any actual profits it earned went straight into paying off the debt. They could no longer grow, and had to downsize little by little, year after year to break even. Its market-share dropped. Its profits dropped. And Amazon, Target, Wal*Mart, and other retailers began to leave it behind.</p><p>By the way, Bain Capital did the exact same thing with KB Toys 10 years prior. In 2000, Bain Capital bought KB Toys, dumped all of their debt into KB Toys, KB Toys went bankrupt and liquidated all of its assets in 2009.</p><p>On March 15th, 2018, Toys R Us announced to all of its workers that all of its stores in US will be closed and sold.<br/><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803" title="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803">https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803</a></p><p>Over May, June, and July, stores across the US liquidated all of their stock, including the Toys R Us I worked at in high school. I wasn't able to visit it in its final days, but now in August, I've been able to come back and see the building one last time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5754.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5754_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5754_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5754_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180806_tru/IMG_5757_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Over the last 18 years, the interior had changed dramatically.
