Toys R Us International had separated from its American parent prior to the Bain Capital purchase. So, if you're able to travel abroad, you can still visit one of my favorite stores of all time.</p><p>No place is this more true than Toys R Us Asia, the most successful branch of the international division, according to the Internet. In particular in Japan, you can easily find a Toys R Us store in most malls. However, directly north of Nagoya, just south of Komaki, along the road underneath the Nagoya Expressway is a special place.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1845_t.webp"></a></p><p>It's a rare standalone Toys R Us location, outside of the mall and other shopping centers. Here's the location in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/f2tKueDDLrjEzf1SA" title="https://goo.gl/maps/f2tKueDDLrjEzf1SA">Google Maps</a>.</p><p>This particular store is the Toys R Us that time forgot. From the outside to the inside, it's like stepping back through time 20 years. </p><p>All of the aisle fixtures and shelving are exactly the same as they were when I worked at Toys R Us from 1997 to 2000. Those fat heavy off-white metal shelves with three teeth that fit into the aisle. That off-white peg board in the back. The plastic covers hooked to the very top shelves for signage and concealing extra product.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1854_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1861_t.webp"></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1865_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1873_t.webp"></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Even though they are painted white, the peg hooks are identical as are all of the price labels on them. The rollers for the diaper rack are identical. Those metal price frames are the same too. The bike racks. The stroller aisle. They even had the old tickets for video game systems!</p><p>All of the prices were printed on white paper instead of yellow. But other than that, it's a near replica.</p><p>The check out lines were identical too, with the exception of the updated cash registers.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_tru/IMG_1910_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>It's pretty amazing how everything is still intact like it hadn't been touched in the last 20 years.</p><p>Again, of Japan's 150+ Toys R Us locations, 99% of them are located in malls and shopping centers. I'm pretty sure that the mall locations don't have the same shelves and aisle fixtures. At my Toys R Us (25 years ago), each section of the aisle with those shelves were 4 feet across. "Merchandise the aisle 4 feet at a time," the old manager would say. I should have brought a tape measure to check if these shelves were 4 feet, but it definitely seemed like it. Japan uses the metric system, so I'm guessing the locations in the malls use more standard Japanese shelves. They wouldn't have defaulted to 4 feet.</p><p>Looking at Google Earth, this Toys R Us was here in 2001, which was back before the International Division broke away from the American parent. Much like Costco does today, they probably manufactured all of these shelves, fixtures, and equipment in America and shipped it overseas. In the last 20 years, there was probably no reason to throw out all of this stuff in order to remodel.</p><p>This North Nagoya location feels like an island in many ways. It feels like an island in time, obviously. But there's nothing else around the area, either. You HAVE to drive to get here, and specifically drive to this location. With nothing else around, this isn't really an impulse stop. There's plenty of parking. The roof is a parking lot, too!</p><p>Despite my photos, many families still come here looking for toys, bikes, and other baby gear. It took me a while to get some photos without people. Actually, I never took photos of the bike area because there was always someone there. So, this location must still be pretty profitable. Makes sense if they're not actually spending any money updating the infrastructure.</p><p>I don't know if the trip to this location would actually be worth it, but if you have deep nostalgia for Toys R Us in the 2000s, and you happen to be driving north out of Nagoya, it could be worth a stop. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Toys R Us is Dead" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/toys-r-us-is-dead">Toys R Us is Dead</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 6, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>From 1997 through 2000, my first part-time job was working at Toys R Us. Now, 18 years later, my store has been closed for good. Obviously the rise of the Internet economy slowly chipped away at Toys R Us's market share, but the real death move began in 2005 when <b>Bain Capital</b> bought the company. </p><p>In 2005, Bain Capital and KKR bought Toys R Us for around $6.6 billion. In order to pay for this sale, that put up some cash, but they mostly shifted debt that they already owed into Toys R Us in order to cover the rest of the cost. In more detail, Toys R Us already had about $1 billion debt at the time of sale. Bain Capital and KKR payed $1.3 billion, and shifted $5.3 billion in debt into Toys R Us. As such, Toys R Us was now around $6.3 billion in debt and only valued at $6.6 billion. It was damn near bankrupt immediately. How is this legal? Or possible?</p><p>[ Citation: <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/06/business/toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/" title="https://www.marketplace.org/2018/03/06/business/toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/">https://www.marketplace.org/.../toys-r-us-and-how-retail-downturn-story-about-debt/</a> ]<br/>[ Citation: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/09/20/toys-r-us-is-a-lesson-in-how-bad-assumptions-feed-bad-financial-planning-creating-failure/?sh=228d6eaa58ea" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamhartung/2017/09/20/toys-r-us-is-a-lesson-in-how-bad-assumptions-feed-bad-financial-planning-creating-failure/?sh=228d6eaa58ea"> https://www.forbes.com/.../toys-r-us-is-how-bad-assumptions-create-failure</a> ]</p><p>Toys R Us was still rather profitable, and could still stand against other retailers. But with its monumental debt, any actual profits it earned went straight into paying off the debt. They could no longer grow, and had to downsize little by little, year after year to break even. Its market-share dropped. Its profits dropped. And Amazon, Target, Wal*Mart, and other retailers began to leave it behind.</p><p>By the way, Bain Capital did the exact same thing with KB Toys 10 years prior. In 2000, Bain Capital bought KB Toys, dumped all of their debt into KB Toys, KB Toys went bankrupt and liquidated all of its assets in 2009.</p><p>On March 15th, 2018, Toys R Us announced to all of its workers that all of its stores in US will be closed and sold.<br/><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803" title="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803">https://www.wsj.com/articles/toys-r-us-tells-workers-it-will-likely-close-all-u-s-stores-1521060803</a></p><p>Over May, June, and July, stores across the US liquidated all of their stock, including the Toys R Us I worked at in high school.

While I'm not a football fan, I am a fan of live events and trying out new things. I also like hanging out with my family. This was actually a repeat gift from a few years prior with my sister, her husband, and my dad all went to the Packers game.</p><p>I don't remember much about the game, but looking into the past, looks like the Vikings won the game, 20-13. Go Purple! I don't think we really hung out or went to any bars. It was a pretty strict 4-hour trip to Lambeau from Minneapolis, and another 4-hour drive back.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Timberline Lodge on Mt.

We went to the ocean, climbed some hills in his town, Eugene, and drove up to Portland a few times to take a look at some places.  On one of those trips to Portland, on the best most clearest day, we continued east in the direction of Mt Hood, Oregon's tallest mountain.</p><p>The Timberline Lodge is a national historic landmark and operating ski lodge on the southern slope of the mountain.  It's the highest occupied point of the mountain.

The building has its own restaurant, common area, bar, and rooms for the guests.  It probably has living quarters for some of the staff, too.  Though, I suppose commuting everyday wouldn't be too difficult.  It only took us an hour and a half from downtown Portland.  But, they'd probably need something for the staff if they were snowed in.

At the base of Timberline's driveway is a town called Government Camp.  It's a super cute, and super quaint mountain town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0401_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0415_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0415_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120326_timberline/IMG_0415_stitch.webp" /></p><p>We stopped at the Visitor Center is town, which was completely covered in snow, and also had a museum with lots of information about the town.  One interesting factoid I remember is that American automotive companies used to have a constant about whose cars could make it to Government Camp from Portland the fastest (or at all) in the middle of January.  It usually took the cars a whole month to make the journey and a lot of the time the cars would get completely stuck or couldn't even make it over the terrain.  The teams would use horses to pull the car along or over whatever horrible obstacles they came across.</p><p>The museum also detailed plenty of expeditions to the peak of Mt. Hood, and displayed the original gear of these mountain climbers.  Most of the outfits were made of heavy cloth, and had plenty of rips and tears from the climb itself.  Googles were scratched, and you could barely see out of them.  It's like looking at our space shuttles and wondering how the hell we ever used these things to get anywhere.</p><p>Down the street is the Ice Axe Grill, home to the <a href="http://www.iceaxegrill.com/" title="http://www.iceaxegrill.com/">Mt. Hood Brewing Company</a>.  Even though this quaint little mountain town probably feels isolated from the rest of society, and especially when it snows 5 or 10 or 20 feet at a time, there's plenty of beer to go around.</p><p>It would be nice to live in such an isolated place.  Away from the constant distraction of a flourishing city, but I think the tranquil isolation would eventually become boring.  And I'm sure very little ever changes out there.  Those types of places probably feel like they live outside of time.</p><p>Anywho, Mt. Hood is beautiful, and it's fantastic how close it is to Portland.  I'd like to see how it looks over the summer, and actually get the chance to walk along some trails, and be able to see the mountain itself rather than just from the road.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pacific Ocean" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pacific-ocean">Pacific Ocean</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's a pretty big hole cut into the rock, and goes down pretty far to connect to the ocean underneath.  As the waves came in, water shoots up through the well, and completely floods the surface.  As the waves recide, all the water is sucked up back into the well.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0132.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0132.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0132.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0131.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0131.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0141.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0141.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0159.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0159.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0159.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0146.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0146.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0146.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0165.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0165.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120325_pacific/IMG_0165.webp"  /></p><p>Bill and I watched this thing for quite a while.

For the 30 minutes we were mesmerized by this hole in the ground, we were able to get 2 of these waves that completely soaked our shoes and pants.  I was on higher rocks than Bill was, and I was still just as soaked.</p><p>I took some video of Thor's Well, in which I get soaked, again, around the 2 minute mark : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRDiup0UNDo" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRDiup0UNDo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRDiup0UNDo</a></p><p>Overall, it was pretty neat to see this side of the Pacific.  I've seen it from the sky while flying back and forth to Japan, and seen it from the Japanese coast line, too, but never directly from the American side.</p><p>One things I was definitely looking for were traces of Tsunami debree from the March 12th Tohoku Earthquake.  There have been some recently news articles saying that people have been finding things on the coast, and, in fact, further north, a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17500008" title="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17500008">"ghost ship"</a> had found it's way to Canada after being removed from its Japanese port.</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not find anything substantial.  We found a car tire, and a bunch of plastic bottles, one of which DID look like a Japanese PET Bottle, but they were most likely just garbage from nearby.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hiking in Eugene" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hiking-in-eugene">Hiking in Eugene</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The sole reason behind this move was that my little sister and her husband purchased Packer tickets for themselves, my dad, and me for their game on Christmas Day.  They are pretty big sports fans, and love going to live events, sporting or otherwise.</p><p>In the past few years, they've brought me to a Badgers game, and a Twins game.  The Badgers game had a huge amount of fans, but no drinking at all.  The Twins game had plenty of drinking, but didn't really have the same level of fandom that Wisconsin brings to its game.  The Packers game had both.  There was massive amounts of drinking, and an incredible level of fandom.  I'm not really into football that much, and I'm even less into the Packers, but it's hard not to get into the game and root for the home team when you're completed immersed.</p><p>I took some pictures.</p><div class='title'><b>"Tailgating"</b></div><p>The game took place at 7:20pm on Sunday.

C2E2 is short for Chicago Comic &amp; Entertainment Expo, and does have more than just comic books.  It extends itself to the Entertainment industry, so it also has some guest appearances, and Q&amp;A panels for specific television shows.</p><p>I was rather excited to go since I missed PAX East this year, and I had never been to a Comic Con before.  I figured it would be in the vain of the San Diego Comic Con, or the New York Comic Con, where it has some comic book stuff, but has grown into TV shows, movies, and video games.  And while it did have some of that stuff, it was definitely muted and mediocre compared to the comic content.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2043.webp"  /></p><p>We arrived at the McCormic Park Place around 9:30am, which gave us a good 30 minutes before the Convention opened.  In very much PAX fashion, when arriving early, they had us go into a queue room when all the other early participants and patiently wait in line for the exhibition hall.  Con staff riled up the crowd with some chants in attempts to get video.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any crowd games for us to play :(</p><p>10am arrived, and we entered the exhibition hall.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1979_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The exhibition hall was jammed packed with comic distributors, indie comic and toy stores from the Chicago area, Tshirt vendors and other random stuff.  For a comic book convention, I expected vendors to have a large supply on hand, and maybe I would be able to fill in the gaps of my own comic collection, ala Battle Chasers #8, and The Maxx Trades #4 &amp; #5.</p><p>No such luck...  It seems that all the comic vendors at this convention specialize in ACTUAL rare comics, and my gaps were merely uncommon.  Comic book vendors had piles of vintage comics that had been appraised and worth plenty of cash.  And I wasn't interested in that.  I suppose I should have been checking prices because now I'm getting curious.  I wonder what the most expensive comic at the Con was...</p><p>There was one booth in the exhibition hall that I did want to check out, which was the Cyanide &amp; Happiness booth, and Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal attached themselves to.  I picked up one of C&amp;H's books and got it signed.  I also picked up SMBC's DVD of shorts, got that signed, and then got an on-the-fly sketch by SMBC artist, Zach Weiner.  I asked for some science related, and he didn't disappoint.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2045.webp"  /></p><p>The artist alley was nearly bone dry.  I have no interest in comic book looking art, which was the style of the vast majority of artists.  There were a few that caught my eye though.  I liked the style of <a href="http://erikrose.com/portfolio.htm" title="http://erikrose.com/portfolio.htm">Erik Rose</a>, whose art is based on a lot of films.  I didn't find any prints I especially like, but I bought a few buttons.  Another rockin artist was <a href="http://-amaya-.deviantart.com" title="http://-amaya-.deviantart.com">Tanya Zolotareva</a>, who had a very distinct gothy style and much different than all the other artists there.  Also, <a href="http://www.davidmack.net/" title="http://www.davidmack.net/">David Mack</a> was there, who has done some great work with the Kabuki series of comics.</p><p>Also, in the exhibition hall were the autograph booths.  Stars of TV, film, and music sat at booths for hours during the day and people lined up to get something autographed, or get their photo taken with them.  They had Sam and Pan from True Blood, who are two of my favorite characters on that show.  And they had Shane and Andrea from The Walking Dead, who are two of my LEAST favorite characters on that show.  They also had Helo from Battlestar Galatica, also my favorite character.</p><p>While that is pretty awesome, I find it odd that they got the B roll of characters for this convention.  That's like saying "We have the cast of The Simpsons", but then only Moe and Barney show up.  I guess you take what you can get.  Unfortunately, approaching these stars ISN'T free.  You can't just walk up to a celebrity without your wallet.  Duh...  Autographs were $30, and photos for $35.  Fuck that...  Off the top of my head, I can't even think of a celebrity I would pay to get a photo taken.  Maybe Keanu Reeves, but Keanu wouldn't allow that.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1978.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway, the exhibition hall was boring, so the next best time killer is going to Panels.  As one would expect, most of these panels were comic book related, and most of those were Marvel.  I don't think I could care less about Marvel, or DC, or any popular comic books.  Superhero comic books are so boring.</p><p>Even before arriving, the only panels that I was interested in were Evangelion related.  Spike Spencer (american voice of Shinji) was at the convention, and on Saturday, he was introducing Evangelion 1.0 before they screened it.  He also had a panel later on about voice acting.  While I don't really care about Spike Spencer, it was Evangelion related, and there was nothing else for me to do.  I didn't make Evangelion 1.0, but I did sit in on the last 10 minutes of his voice acting panel, which was Q&amp;A when I arrived.  Most of the questions were inside jokes that I did not get.</p><p>But success! I got my Evangelion Bluray signed by him, as well as purchasing his self published (and self printed) book about voice acting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_2044.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess I had fun.  I was expecting a lot more video game related things, and more overall nerd culture, but it was all comic book instead.  And I would say that's a good thing, as the San Diego Comic Con, and New York Comic Con have slowly been overrun by thing that aren't comic books.  C2E2 is bringing back the Comic book convention to the comic book nerds, rather than succumb to the wiles of more popular entertainment.  But it still has some of that entertainment which makes the larger conventions so successful.</p><p>I would probably go again.  Especially if we had another large group of con-goers to hang out with, as we did this time.  I even ran into an old SPAMM member that wasn't part of our group!  It was good times :)</p><p>There were also quite a bit of costumers.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110319_c2e2/IMG_1976.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/america/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
