| April 20, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Coming from English, Japanese is one of the most difficult languages on learn. It's so difficult to learn because nearly every aspect of the language is different. The words, the grammar, the ideas, the culture, and the way Japanese is used all differ from English. </p><p>In fact, the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" title="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/">Foreign Service Institute</a> classifies Japanese as a Category IV language, which requires a minimum of 2200 hours of class time (88 weeks of 5-hour daily training) to achieve a General Professional Proficiency level. It is the Institute's high ranking, shared only by Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.</p><p>The best way to learn Japanese, and any language, is to be immersed in the language. Have daily contact with the language, and try to find a balance of using all four or five methods of communicating with a language. These four methods are: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Sometimes, people break speaking into two methods: speaking written or prepared words and speaking your own improvised thoughts. Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing is also the order of difficulty of performing them.</p><div class='title'><b>Listening</b></div><p>By being in Japan, listening becomes a daily routine. However, it can be easy to shut everything out and ignore what it said around you. In your native country listening to your native language, you can hear and understand everything around you. You are part of the public consciousness. In a foreign country with a foreign language, you're no longer able to naturally understand everything. You have to work at it. And work is often exhausting, which makes it easy to tune out others.</p><p>There's a lot to understand, and it's possible that there's some things that you'll never understand. But, as time goes on, you will have the ability to understand some things, and be able to connect dots to understand things. If you get in the habit of tuning out others, you rob yourself of the ability to naturally understand your surroundings. So, don't tune out too much. Make attempts at understanding.</p><p>When you hear common phrases, or sometimes when people talk with you. Try repeating what they say. This may seem stupid, but this is how babies naturally begin to learn languages. Which, also may seem stupid for you. Of course, as adults, we can also learn the rules of the languages and compare them with our own language. The combination of these two things will allow use to learn the language.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>Listening becomes the easiest method of communication in Japan because you have so many passive opportunities to practice. Writing is the most difficult because you are not only outputting what you know of the language, but you have to activity do it to get better at it. It takes the most work and time out of the others.</p><p>Unlike English with its 26 letters (or 52, including both upper and lowercase alphabets), Japanese uses three sets of alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana have 46 characters each. Kanji, on the other hand, has over 10,000. Although, there are hundreds or thousands of kanji that are outdated. High School graduates are expected to know the most common 2,000. The Genki books only go through about 320.</p><p>All three of these alphabets are used together. Take a look at this sentence:</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span></p></p><p>The first two characters are <span class='ja'>ジム</span>, katakana. Katakana is almost exclusively used for foreign words in the Japanese language. Both Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic alphabets, so each of the characters have specific sounds that are said the exact same way wherever they are in the sentence, with a few exceptions. <span class='ja'>ジム</span> is my name, Jim, which is phonetically spelled.</p><p>The next two characters are <span class='ja'>先生</span>, kanji. In sentences, kanji are used for solid words, such as Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives. In this sentence, we have 3 words using kanji: <span class='ja'>先生</span>, <span class='ja'>店</span>, and <span class='ja'>行く</span>. <span class='ja'>先生</span> is <i>sensei</i>, or teacher. Combined with my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生</span>, it's used as a suffix to denote that I'm a teacher. Generally, non-casually, when referring to other people, you use a suffix with their name. <span class='ja'>店</span> is <i>mise</i>, or store. And, <span class='ja'>行く</span> is <i>iku</i>, or the verb, to go.</p><p>The other characters in the sentence (<span class='ja'>は</span>, <span class='ja'>に</span>, <span class='ja'>きます</span>) are hiragana. This is getting ahead of ourselves, but they are used in the sentence as particles and a conjugation. Using <span class='ja'>は</span>(wa) after my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生は</span> denotes that I'm the subject of the sentence. Using <span class='ja'>に</span>(ni) with shop <span class='ja'>店に</span> denotes the direction of the action. And, <span class='ja'>行きます</span>(ikimasu) is the present positive conjugation of the verb <span class='ja'>行く</span>, meaning to go.</p><p>Putting the meaning together: Jim goes to the store. (or Mr. Jim goes to the store.)</p><div class='title'><b>Hiragana and Pronunciation</b></div><p>Even though there are three writing systems, both katakana and kanji can be written in hiragana, which is the first alphabet we'll learn. Additionally, every hiragana character can be written in Alphabetic characters, which is where we'll start when learning words. This is called Romaji.</p><p>Let's go back to our sentence.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span><br/><span class='ja'>じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span><br/>jimu-sensei wa mise ni ikimasu</p></p><p>Looking at the sentence in Romaji can help with pronunciation. Each hiragana has a specific sound and pronunciation doesn't change based on spelling as in English. Here's all the Hiragana, with Romaji to the right.</p><p><div class="columns center"><div class="column"><span class='ja'>あ　い　う　え　お</span><br/><span class='ja'>か　き　く　け　こ</span><br/><span class='ja'>さ　し　す　せ　そ</span><br/><span class='ja'>た　ち　つ　て　と</span><br/><span class='ja'>な　に　ぬ　ね　の</span><br/><span class='ja'>は　ひ　ふ　へ　ほ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ま　み　む　め　も</span><br/><span class='ja'>や　　　ゆ　　　よ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ら　り　る　れ　ろ</span><br/><span class='ja'>わ　　　　　　を</span><br/><span class='ja'>ん</span></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">a <span class='ja'>　</span>i <span class='ja'>　</span>u <span class='ja'>　</span>e <span class='ja'>　</span>o<br/>ka<span class='ja'>　</span>ki<span class='ja'>　</span>ku<span class='ja'>　</span>ke<span class='ja'>　</span>ko<br/>sa<span class='ja'>　</span>shi<span class='ja'>　</span>su<span class='ja'>　</span>se<span class='ja'>　</span>so<br/>ta<span class='ja'>　</span>chi<span class='ja'>　</span>tsu<span class='ja'>　</span>te<span class='ja'>　</span>to<br/>na<span class='ja'>　</span>ni<span class='ja'>　</span>nu<span class='ja'>　</span>ne<span class='ja'>　</span>no<br/>ha<span class='ja'>　</span>hi<span class='ja'>　</span>fu<span class='ja'>　</span>he<span class='ja'>　</span>ho<br/>ma mi mu me mo<br/>ya<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yu<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yo<br/>ra<span class='ja'>　</span>ri<span class='ja'>　</span>ru<span class='ja'>　</span>re<span class='ja'>　</span>ro<br/>wa <span class='ja'>　　</span> <span class='ja'>　　</span>wo<br/>-n</div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Speaking in terms of English pronunciation, the overall Japanese language is based on 5 vowel sounds with a combination of the above consonants. The vowel sounds do not change when paired with other characters.</p><p>Also, you may have noticed that ji, from my name <span class='ja'>じむ</span>, is not listed in the alphabet. There are certain characters that can take a <i>ten-ten</i> mark or a <i>maru</i> mark to slightly expand the alphabet. <span class='ja'>し</span>(shi) becomes <span class='ja'>じ</span>(ji).</p><div class='title'><b>Kanji and Readability</b></div><p>Note: Often students wonder, if you can write a sentence using only hiragana, a much less complex writing system, why ever use the other two? Why not write everything in hiragana.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span> vs.<span class='ja'>　じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span></p></p><p>Coming from English, it makes sense to write everything using a limited number of characters, but the overall readability of the kanji sentence is far higher than the second. In fact, I added spaces in the hiragana sentence to improve its readability, but you still have to read each character to understand the words. The kanji sentence doesn't even need it.</p><p>While we don't use Kanji in English, the idea of using symbols to form a familiar shape representing a word is not so foreign. We've been reading and writing English since we were children, and one of the natural passive techniques we've developed is recognizing a word purely based on its shape. As long as the shape of the word fits the pattern we're used to, we can read and understand the word immediately without looking at each of the letters.</p><p>Kanji works the same way. Once you know the meaning of the kanji, you don't even have to read the whole sentence. Because there are so many kanji, much of a sentence's ambiguity is also removed. When I say, "light" without any context, do I mean something that shines on to a surface or something that's not heavy? Much like English, Japan has words written in Hiragana the same way with different meanings. But when using Kanji, the meaning is clear.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Again, learning Japanese is not a simple process. Just takes things step-by-step. Ask questions.

Almost everyone has some form of culture shock, but it is different for each person and each person deals with it in different ways.</p><p>It can sometimes happen abruptly from a situation or incident, or slowly build from small problems over time. Sometimes, incidents of culture shock can happen immediately upon arrival. Other times, it might be months until feeling some kind of culture shock. For me, there have been two periods where I've lived in Japan, now and study abroad in college. Both circumstances for living in Japan were entirely different, so the conditions of experiencing culture shock were entirely different, too.</p><p>Either way, when living in a foreign country, culture shock follows 4 (or 5) overall stages and the overall graph of your steady mood usually looks like this.</p><p><canvas id="fullChart" /></p><p>Going up, then down, back up and eventually returning to equilibrium. The four main stages are <span class="rainbow_mag"><b>The Honeymoon Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_voi"><b>The Frustration Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_blu"><b>The Adjustment Phase</b></span>, and <span class="rainbow_gre"><b>The Adaption Phase</b></span>. The fifth extra phase is <b>The Reintegration Phase</b>, when returning to your own country.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Honeymoon Phase -</b></div><p>When people think of culture shock, they often think of it as something negative. But, the overall feeling of experiencing life in a new country is often met with excitement. There are so many new things to experience differently from your own country. New food, new buildings, new money, new people, new stores. If you're a fan of your new country, touching things that you've dreamed of for the first time is an amazing experience you'll probably never forget.</p><p>All of these new experiences raise your overall mood level, and we move up the curve.</p><p>If you're only in a foreign country for a short amount of time, especially on vacation or a very short study abroad, this is probably the only part of the curve that you'll experience. This was the case when I studied abroad. Every day felt like a vacation. Exploring Nagasaki and writing blog posts about it was an amazing adventure that had something new and interesting each day. I never experienced any cultural problems large enough to pull me down.</p><p>So, in short, the honeymoon phase is meeting differences in culture with joy and excitement.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Frustration Phase -</b></div><p>The shock phase is the opposite. This is what happens when meeting differences between your countries and cultures has problems. This is also what people think of when they hear, Culture Shock.</p><p>Again, this can happen gradually over the course of several incidents or perhaps even one big incident. Problems are caused by not really understanding what people are saying. Or by people not really understanding you. Problems are caused by something someone said or did that was different than what you expected. Problems are caused by someone putting you into a situation where you felt uncomfortable and you felt trapped. And problems are also caused by small differences in culture that annoy and bother you that built over time.</p><p>It's easy to feel alone when you're in a foreign country. People often describe this feeling as being put into a box. In a foreign country, you don't have the same comforts as your normal routine. If you have a problem, you may not have a way to comfort yourself. And often when seeking those comforts, you can't find an equivalent and often don't know how to ask for it. So, for any problems, you hide in your box and you wait for this feeling to pass. Or, you wait until you're back home.</p><p>Often as you recluse, anything foreign or anything outside of your normal will reinforce these feelings and put you further into a spiral you cannot break from.</p><div class='title'><b>Experience</b></div><p>Often when you're in a foreign country for a short amount of time, you probably won't have enough time for these problems to really build and hit you. And if you do have problems, you only have to wait until the end of trip. There's a fast-approaching light at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>That doesn't mean it won't happen for short trips, but be prepared that it might. It really comes down to expectations. Making too many assumptions without verification often leads to problems.</p><p>Frustration and Shock is much more common to occur after several months of living in the country. After meeting with people and working with people, making friends, and hanging out, you begin to feel like you're accepted, and like you've become part of the society.</p><p>But, you are pushed away. Your friends or co-workers do something that clearly shows they do not truly accept you as part of their society. You're just the foreigner, and you'll always be the foreigner. Once again, you made an assumption that you thought was fact.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adjustment Phase -</b></div><p>The overall strategy of Culture Shock is not to avoid it, but learning how to deal with it. This is the adjustment phase. Much like frustration, the ways that people naturally adjust are different for each person, but there's always room to learn and try new ways of returning back to natural mood level.</p><p>Skipping to the punchline, the overall best way of adjusting and understanding the situation better is to talk about it. Talk with your co-workers and friends about why you felt uncomfortable. Talk to other foreigners about similar situations, how they felt and how they overcame it. By talking about it, I mean opening a dialogue and expressing ideas. By talking about it, I <b>do not</b> mean to confront them about what they said and try to teach them why it's bad. </p><p>On one hand, they could absolutely be out of line and did something worthy of being called on. But, on the other hand, within their culture, it could be a socially-accepted action. If you call them on it, you're only reinforcing your foreign divide between them, and possibly reinforcing their behavior. Often in these scenarios, it's up to you to change. It's up to you to ask others and inform yourself about why any misunderstandings may have happened.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Tricks</b></div><p>Above is the overall best way to adjust, but there are several tricks to help elevate your mood.</p><p>If you're being overwhelmed by too many things outside of your comfort zone, try to reconnect with things from your home country. It's a good way to feel like you're normal. Buy some foreign food from your country. Or watch a movie. Or visit somewhere that reminds you of home. Call your parents or call your friends back home. If you feel like an outsider, take a vacation and be an outsider, if only for a few hours or a day.</p><p>It's also pretty simple, but exercise. Exercise is a great way to mentally relax. Often as you blow off all of your physical strength through exercise, your mental strength will get exhausted, too. Then, you're able to move through your emotions and process them. Maybe meditation is your thing instead of exercise? Singing is fun, too.</p><p>Whether its food or exercise or singing, finding some way of centering yourself can slow or stop your downward fall, so you can begin the climb back up.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adaption Phase -</b></div><p>The Adjustment Phase course corrects your mood and brings your back up to normal, through the Adaptation phase.</p><p>The more you understand about your foreign country, the more you can understand about how you fit into it. When you can successfully apply that knowledge to your life, you feel like you've had a win. You feel like you've overcome a barrier and become closer to your new home. <b>This is your overall goal</b>. Overall understanding and adaptation isn't something that happens over night. It takes time, patience, and communication. And often new problems occur. </p><div class='title'><b>Reoccurrence</b></div><p>Culture Shock and frustration isn't a single event. It's often multiple events throughout your life in a foreign country that make you feel like a foreigner and not accepted. Once you feel you've adapted, it's not uncommon for something new and unknown to happen and bring you back down.</p><p>Also, it's not uncommon for people to cling to quick fixes or escape rather than truly reach out, communicate and understand the problem. If you hold on to grudges and problems, you will never fit in and you'll always be an outsider. </p><p>Ultimately, your goal is to fit in society as best as you can. You must adapt in some ways in order to do this. This doesn't mean losing part of yourself. It means gaining a new part of yourself. Gaining the ability to fit into both societies.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Reintegration Phase -</b></div><p>If you're in a foreign country to live forever, then adaptation is the goal. But most foreigners will eventually go back to their country, either for a trip or for good. Then, the whole cycle begins again, but often it can be more severe. This is The Reintegration Phase, also sometimes known as Reverse Culture Shock.</p><p>If you've adapted and integrated in your foreign country, now YOU are the foreigner when you return home. You are expected to pick up life exactly as you left it, but you are different. You've changed. You do things differently than before. You talk different than before. Your personality may have changed, too. Depending on the length of time you've been away, your country has changed, too.</p><p>If you've been integrated in your foreign country for a while, you can often forget what it's like to no longer have a foreign bubble around you. You suddenly instantly passively understand everyone and everything around you, whereas in your new country, you become comfortable in certain levels of understanding. </p><p>People make a lot of assumptions about you, too, because they don't see you as anything different than themselves. Adjusting is often a harsh reality of what you've left behind.</p><p>This is normal. But, you've been here before. Honeymoon phase, Frustration phase, Adjustment phase, and Adaptation phase. Do your best, and don't give up. Communicate, Exercise, and Adapt.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Features and Potential of Budo Culture" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-features-and-potential-of-japanese-budo-culture">The Features and Potential of Budo Culture</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 12, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I attended the 30th Annual International Seminar of Budo Culture, which coincided with the 150th anniversary of the start of the Meiji era in Japan.  This year’s main lecture was <b>The Features and Potential of Japanese Budo Culture</b> given by Seiichi Takeuchi <span class='ja'>竹内</span> <span class='ja'>整一</span>.  He is currently a professor at Kamakura Women’s University, and former professor of the University of Tokyo.  His field is the study of ethics and Japanese thought.</p><p>The lecture was given in Japanese and translated into English by Alex Bennett, who is currently a professor at Kansai University and has written and translated many books on the Japanese Budo arts.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my 3rd time attending the seminar.  Every year I’m able to get amazing insights into budo martial arts and learn about their connection to Japanese psychology and culture.  I previously wrote about the main lecture from the first seminar I attended two years ago: <a href="/old/v7/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan" title="/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">March 4th, 2016</a>.</p><p>Overall, I felt the contents of the lecture did not match the title, but the main idea expressed in the lecture was another fascinating look at an explanation for Japanese culture.  The theme carried through the explanations and examples was that of <i>onozukara</i> and <i>mizukara</i></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」</span></b></div><p>Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> explained the cooperative duality of these two forces behind the decisions and actions of people in Japanese culture and society.</p><p><i>Onozukara</i> <span class='ja'>おのずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自然の働く</span><br/><i>Mizukara</i> <span class='ja'>みずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自分の能力</span></p><p>Let’s do <i>mizukara</i>, first.  <i>Mizukara</i> is the effect from oneself.  It’s the idea that an action or decision you made came as a result of your own willpower.  <i>Onozukara</i> is the workings of nature, the idea that there is an overwhelming force behind a decision or action that made or allowed it happen.</p><p><i>Mizukara</i> is pretty easy to understand, but <i>Onozukara</i> is much more ambiguous.  In western countries, <i>onozukara</i> could be similar to the will of god.  God is an outside influence, and people often thank God for giving them fortunes, or blame God for misfortunes.  This was brought up in a question after the lecture had finished.</p><p>But for Japanese people, the idea of God is not a singular entity.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned if you asked a Japanese person who they pray to when they pray, they would not have an answer.  They wouldn’t know.  The will of nature is a result of many different factors and moving parts within the world and society.</p><p>As another example, another question was asked, "Did you decide to do this lecture? Or was it the will of nature?"  He replied that he did want to do lecture, but he was also asked by many people to do it.  The people he knew and the connections he’s made throughout his life knew his expertise that made him qualified to give a lecture on this subject.  In that way, there was a force that created the opportunity for him to accept.  So, this lecture was a result of the actions of both nature and self.</p><p>So, the idea of <i>onozukara</i> is the force of everything around us.  It’s the connections we’ve made with people in our lives, the opportunities society gives us, and nature itself.  It is not, directly, "the will of God."</p><div class='title'><b>Example within Japanese Language</b></div><p>These two concepts aren’t something that is thought of on the surface level.  People aren’t consciously thinking about the will of themselves or nature when making decisions.  But there are examples within the Japanese language that build on this idea.</p><p>The main example given was <b>I am to be married</b> <span class='ja'>結婚することになった</span>.  When people get married in Japan and they announce it to their family and friends, they use this phrase.  It’s very passive and reflects the idea of <i>onozukara</i>.  Getting married is simply a matter of course.  It’s natural.  Additionally, the effect of getting married wasn’t just decided or caused between the two involved.  It was the culmination of the people around them and their families’ blessings and good intentions.</p><p>He did mention later in the lecture that a lot of young people these days use a more affirmative phrase when speaking informally about marriage, <span class='ja'>結婚することにした</span>, <b>we’ve decided to get married</b>.  The two getting married take responsibility for their marriage as opposed to passively excepting it as a matter of nature.</p><p>There could be any number of reasons for why this is becoming more popular.  Perhaps young people aren’t being taught more tradition methods of speaking than they were before.  Maybe people aren’t getting married as often as before, so they don’t hear the phrase enough.  Or perhaps, as English and the western world becomes more prevalent in Japan, people are becoming more direct and affirmative when expressing themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Connections to Budo</b></div><p>As a practitioner of a budo martial arts, we also seek for our movements to become natural.  In the beginning, we chose to study a martial art of our own free will (<i>mizukara</i>).  We all have our reasons for wanting to do it, whether it be for health, for friends, for fun, or because it looks cool.  We start from ourselves.</p><p>There Japanese word <span class='ja'>習う</span> <i>narau</i> means "to learn", but literally, it means "to continually repeat things" and becoming accustomed to it.  As a result, over time, these actions become natural.  You no longer need to think to do them.</p><p>In Budo, we strive for this level of movement where the thought process is no longer a factor, and to become part of nature, the natural flow of life (<i>onozukara</i>).  When movements and actions are not performed naturally, they are not seen as being complete.</p><p>In Kyudo (archery), for example, when one reaches the level of complete mastery, the practitioner feels that the bow no longer exists.</p><div class='title'><b>The 3 points of Japanese Thought</b></div><p>Within the balance of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> is the concept of Japanese thought and 3 points that define it.</p><p><span class='ja'>自然</span> <i>shizen</i> - nature<br/><span class='ja'>意気</span> <i>iki</i> - will power<br/><span class='ja'>諦念</span> <i>teinen</i> - resignation</p><p>The idea of <b>nature</b> leads to accidental fury that was must put up with.  It’s something that we must endure and grow from.  <b>Will power</b> is the willingness to put your body on line for what may happen.  And if something goes wrong, it’s your responsibility to <b>resign</b> yourself to the outcome, and not make excuses for the result.</p><p>Though, resignation does not mean to simply give up.  It’s about reconciling the efforts of one’s will with the movement of nature, and to be able to see something clearly for what it is.  And in some cases, recognize your powerlessness to deal with whatever comes.  We take for granted our power over nature and often think that we can overcome it, but in reality we cannot.  Nature is a much greater force.</p><p><span class='ja'>申し訳ない</span> <i>moushi wakenai</i><br/>This phrase literally translates to "there were no reasons behind my actions" or "there is no verbal excuse for what I have done."  This is used as a strong apology in Japanese, but an actual apology means to explain your actions and why you were wrong.  This goes one step further by saying there can be no excuse for the action I’ve done.  In this way, you’ve accepted the outcome (resigned) and take full responsibility (will power).</p><p>On the other hand…</p><p><span class='ja'>すみません</span> <i>sumimasen</i><br/>This is used as a light apology and basically means <b>excuse me</b> or <b>sorry</b>, but the direct and complete translation is something closer to "my actions were not clear or clean or complete," or "I wasn’t able to completely do this action myself."</p><div class='title'><b>Other Japanese Words</b></div><p>Much like the lecture on the cardinal virtues of Japan, speaker Seiichi Takeuchi wrote several books on the subject of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.  He wrote 4 books, actually.  3 of which are out-of-print and expensive!  On Amazon, they are being sold for nearly 7000<span class='ja'>円</span>.  But, there was one book I could buy for only 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」のあわいで</span> <span class='ja'>やまと言葉で</span> <span class='ja'>哲学する</span>.</b> or <i>onozukara to mizukara no awai de yamato-kotoba de tetsugaku-suru</i>.  <i>Awai</i> isn’t so easy to translate, but I was told, in this context, that it basically means between.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> talked about this balance between both <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> in his lecture, so I think it makes sense.  <i>Yamato-kotoba</i> basically means words (<i>kotoba</i>) that encompass the spirit of Japan (<i>yamato</i>).  And lastly, <i>tetsugaku</i> is philosophy.  So, the title is basically <b>The Philosophy of Japanese Words and Their Existence Between the Balance of <i>Onozukara</i> and <i>Mizukara</i></b>.</p><p>The book starts off with a quick summary and definition for <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>, and then has chapter on specific Japanese words, phrases, or expressions, their history, and their connection to <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For example, <span class='ja'>ありがたい</span> (thanks), <span class='ja'>めでたい</span> (congratulations), <span class='ja'>あう</span> (when meeting someone), <span class='ja'>あいする</span> (loving someone), and so forth.  Maybe in the future, I’ll try and go through some of these chapters and write something about them.  For many people, though, Japanese philosophy is an incredibly dense topic.</p><div class='title'><b>Relation to Myself</b></div><p>Anyways, </p><p class='img'><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Lecture Abstract</b></div><p>Japanese will often say things like <i>kekkon suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to be married) or <i>shuushoku suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to start work).  It should be expressed as "I decided to …"  Even if something is decided by the will of the individual (<i>mizukara</i>), it is expressed as something that has been predetermined for him or her as a matter of course (<i>onozukara</i>).  This in turn indicates a tendency to accept things in one’s life and the world as being naturally preordained and to be accepted passively.  The Japanese philosophers Kuki Shuuzou identified three elements in the features of Japanese thought: "nature" (<i>shizen</i>), "chic" (<i>iki</i>), and "resignation" (<i>teinen</i>).  This means that based on "natural" (<i>onozukara</i>) conduct, when something occurs the individual decides from one’s self (<i>mizukara</i>) to confront the situation putting their own body on the line (for example, seppuku) in the spirit of "chicness" (<i>iki</i>), while also resigning (<i>teinen</i>) the self to go with the natural flow (<i>onozukara</i>).  The culture of Japanese thought is considered within the encounter between the movement of nature (<i>onozukara</i>) and exertion of the self (<i>mizukara</i>).</p><p>Japanese budo culture is the same.  According to Kuki, "The ideas of Japanese morality maintain a significant meaning in universal nature (of <i>onozukara</i>)…  Morality which must reach the stage of becoming 'natural' cannot be seen as complete."  The term "morality" (<i>doutoku</i>) can be replaced by the word "budo" here.  In bud, first engaging in rigorous training or study from your own volition (<i>mizukara</i>), if it does not ultimately become an inevitably natural (<i>onozukara</i>) activity then it "cannot be seen as complete."  To "<i>narau</i>" (learn) means "to continually repeat things" thereby gradually becoming accustomed (<i>nare</i>) to it, and "reaching the stage where it is natural."  In the culture of Japanese bud, there are correlations with moral, religious, and artistic thought in that one’s own efforts (<i>mizukara</i>) will finally proliferate into and connect with natural expansiveness and depth (<i>onozukara</i>).  Seen in this way, the features and potential become apparent.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kendo San-dan 三段" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kendo-sandan">Kendo San-dan 三段</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 24, 2017 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><span class='ja'>剣道三段に合格しました</span>！</p><p>Right on track.  After passing the ni-dan test two years ago, I’ve been able to continue practicing and learning more about the Japanese martial art of kendo.  And last weekend, I was able to pass the 3rd level of dan, san-dan, in kendo.  </p><p>According to the sensei giving the test, I am the first foreigner to pass this test in Gifu.  Breakin’ boundaries!  Though, that title obviously comes with some caveats.  There are plenty of other foreigners living in Japan that have passed this test, and are way higher rank than me.  They just don’t live in Gifu.  If Gifu had a higher foreign population, someone would’ve passed this test long ago.  It’s more a sign of foreign folk living in more remote areas of Japan.</p><p>I was certainly nervous going into the test.  I understood everything that was required of me, but I wasn’t sure if I could do everything perfectly and correctly.  I don’t think I would’ve been able to pass if it wasn’t for my new job working at Takayama Nishi High School, and practicing kendo with the students, especially the 3rd year students, nearly every day for the last two months.  It was really rewarding taking the same test with those students, and all of us passing.</p><p>Passing the test with my 3rd year high school students is also very apt because I feel like san-dan level is analogous to high school level proficiency and knowledge in kendo.  Passing san-dan is like graduating high school in kendo.  And, in a few months, the 3rd year students will actually graduate high school.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Levels</b></div><p>I previously remarked that passing ni-dan just felt like a stepping stone.  San-dan was the true next test.  But, after talking with some people about it, I don’t think that’s exactly true.  In fact, I think the high school analogy works pretty well.  The 1st grade kyu, or ikkyu, is equivalent to elementary school proficiency.  1st grade dan is like the beginning of junior high school, and 2nd grade dan is completing junior high school.  3rd grade dan is completing high school.  After completing high school, you’re an adult in kendo.  Fully proficient in kendo.</p><p>The next level is 4th grade dan, which could be thought of as completing college.  You are now a full professional in kendo.  Kendo is no longer just something you did, it is something you do.  You have proven that you are kendo.  With the next grade, 5th dan, it’s like completing a masters or a phd program.  You are not only a professional kendo practitioner, but also a specialist in kendo.  Typically, 4th and 5th grade dan are the lowest levels where one leads their own dojo or has a sensei status within their own dojo.</p><p>Beyond that are 6th, 7th, and 8th dan.  These levels are only awarded on a national level.  A practitioner is now nationally recognized as a master in kendo.  Even though kendo is a life of continued study of the art, most lessons are learned through teaching others, and contributing to the martial art as a whole.  You are now a master that others look up to.  </p><p>Anyway, I think this is a pretty good comparison.</p><p>Having passed the test of adulthood in kendo (3rd grade), the next step is becoming a professional in the martial art (4th grade).  Apparently, people consider this the next big step.  Probably because of the age requirements.  4th grade dan is the first level only adults can take.  </p><p>In Gifu, 4th and 5th grade dan tests are only done twice a year and with everyone in the prefecture.  Up through 3rd dan, the proctors travel around to different regions several times throughout the year.  It’s a much bigger deal with much fewer practitioners taking the test.</p><p>But, for me, that’s in 3 years.  It’s not enough to simply "cram" for the test starting 2 months in advance.  I need to continue practicing throughout these next 3 years and retain the ideals of my current grade so I’m able to reach beyond it.  Thankfully, I work at the perfect school and live in a great town to make this happen.</p><p><i>Update: March 1st</i></p><p>Today, all of the 3rd year students graduated from high school.  We also received everyone’s certificate for completion of 3rd grade dan back in November, so they were able to get them before they left officially left school.  It’s very fitting (though also convenient) to get them today as I consider passing san-dan as the equivalent of completing high school.</p><p>I got my certificate, too. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having now mastered the basics of doing kendo for myself, 4th grade dan and up is the study of being able to instructor others on the best ways to do kendo and guide them on the right path while sharpening your own skills.  And as high school students graduate, they continue to university and college and do exactly that with either kendo or their own profession.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Arrival" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/arrival">Arrival</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And through learning the language, her thought process changes, her perception of time begins to change, and she’s able to view parts of her future. Because she’s able to understand and process their language, she’s able to think like them and perceive time like them.</p><p>This is the central plot of the movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Human Examples</b></div><p>Let’s go back to our previous sentence, and compare it with some other languages.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.<br/>Je marche à l'école tous les jours.<br/>Yo camino a la escuela todos los dias.<br/>Ich gehe taglich zur Schule.</code></p><p>There’s English, French, Spanish, and German.  Each has its own sound and ring, but the basic sentence structure is the same.  I walk.  Je marche.  Yo camino.  Ich gehe.</p><p>The very first thing we care about in the sentence is "who" followed immediately by "what is he/she/it doing."  After that, everything else is details.</p><p>I think this is because our culture, personalities, and attitudes tend to be very direct.  Or we tend to favor people and ideas that are very direct.  If we can quickly and succinctly communicate the who/what and it’s action, we can understand the idea faster and fuller.</p><p>So, how does this compare with Japanese.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は毎日学校に歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>First is the subject (<span class='ja'>私</span> <i>watashi</i> or I), but the verb is the very last thing in the sentence (<span class='ja'>行きます</span> <i>ikimasu</i> go).  All of the other details are explained before the actual actions.  I think this is because Japanese language and culture tends to be indirect a lot of the time.</p><p>The Japanese teacher in class went on to give some examples of indirectness in Japanese, such as refusing an invitation.  In English, when refusing an invitation, we typically say something like, "Sorry, I can’t" or "I’m busy," and then maybe followed by a reason.  The refusal can be softer, but typically the first thing we say is very direct, "I can’t."</p><p>In Japanese, such directness could be considered rude or harsh, so the polite way to refuse is to be more indirect.  "Sorry.  On that day, I’ll be out of town"  or "Sorry, I already have another engagement on that day."  There’s no real reason to say "I can’t" because it’s implied, and because of that those harsh words are never said.</p><div class='title'><b>Switching Brains</b></div><p>As long as I’ve been learning Japanese, people have always mentioned the idea that they’re able to "switch their brain" when fully immersed in Japanese.  They claim they think in Japanese and speaking Japanese becomes more natural to them.  Sometimes they need to stop for a second to switch from talking in one language to the other.  </p><p>This idea is the foundation behind the plot of <b>Arrival</b>.  Louise can change switch her brain when communicating in the alien language, and then be able to perceive her current and future memories at a single time.</p><p>This has never been the case for me.  Over these last 4 years of living here, and 15 years since first learning Japanese, I’ve really just maintained a single mode of thought.  My thought process always tends to translate and interpret the incoming Japanese into something I can understand.  Outgoing, too, has a quick translation from English to Japanese.</p><p>Though, this single mode of thought has changed and been molded over time by all the language and culture I’ve absorbed and learned by living here.  For certain kinds of grammar and vocabulary, I can say them pretty fast.  It just feels more instinctual rather than a complete switch.  Through practice, I feel like I’ve simply trained my brain rather than developed something completely separate.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Cardinal Virtues of Japan 日本の元徳" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">The Cardinal Virtues of Japan 日本の元徳</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The first one was titled <b>The Cardinal Virtues of Japan</b> and took place directly after the opening ceremony on the first day.  The lecture was given by Kanno Kakumyou <span class='ja'>菅野</span> <span class='ja'>覚明</span>, a professor at Kogakkan University, whose expertise is in Japanese ethical thought in fields such as Shintoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, and bushidou.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1976_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was spoken in Japanese, and translated/interpreted by Bruce Flanagan, lecturer at Tokyo University of Science of Engineering, and Toyo Gakuen University Theory of Interpreting and Translation.</p><p>The lecture, <b>The Cardinal Virtues of Japan</b>, had the following abstract:</p><div class='title'><b>Lecture Abstract</b></div><p>One typical Japanese manner of thinking suggest that our life is actually a path (<i>michi</i> or <i>dou</i>) on which we journey day-to-day towards self-improvement.  This philosophy is evident in Japanese arts such as poetry, singing, calligraphy, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement, where the names of the art includes the suffix <i>dou</i>.  Budo is another example.  Budo is a system of armed and unarmed fighting techniques, but martial arts and skills alone do not constitute budo in the philosophical sense.  Actual fighting techniques were called <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> and were considered distinct from budo.</p><p>The goal of <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> is to defeat an opponent but this is not necessarily the case in budo.  Naturally, budo practitioners also train to defeat an opponent, however that is just one part of the process of achieving the larger goal of self-development.  Put simply, in budo, as with training in other <i>dou</i> arts, perfection of one's character is the ultimate objective.</p><p>An individual who has achieved excellence in a particular field may be called a <i>meijin</i> (master) or <i>tatsujin</i> (expert).  While the terms <i>meijin</i> and <i>tatsujin</i> refer to the technical proficiency of the individual, the terms may also be used to refer to an individual who possesses unique traits and is recognized as being wise or holy, such as Confucius or Buddha.  Budo as a form of <i>dou</i>, provides the practitioner with a 'path' or means to achieve the enlightened awareness of a wise or holy person.  If, through achieving a high degree of self-development, a person has attained some desirable attribute, then we call this personality trait their 'virtue' (<i>toku</i>).  There are many difference kinds of virtues that people try to develop in themselves and these values are generally universal.  However ethnic, cultural, and religious groups often differ in their opinions on which virtues are the most important.</p><p>Fundamental virtues of particular importance are called 'cardinal virtues' (<i>gentoku</i>).  In Christianity, faith, hope, and love are espoused as the three cardinal values (Corinthians 13).  In ancient Greek philosophy, wisdom, courage, restraint, and justice, formed the four cardinal virtues.  In Confucianism, the five values were benevolence, justice, courtesy, wisdom, and sincerity, and the the three virtues were wisdom, benevolence, and courage.  In this lecture I will discuss some of the important virtues associated with Japanese budo taking into account Buddhist and Shinto thought.</p><div class='title'><b>Unpacking the abstract, and defining terms</b></div><p>First, a virtue or <i>toku</i> <span class='ja'>徳</span> is a positive personality trait.  It's something that contributes to the dignity of one's life.  <i>Gentoku</i> <span class='ja'>元徳</span> is a fundamental virtue of importance, or <b>cardinal virtue</b>.  These are the basic building blocks of what makes a desirable personality.  As mentioned above in the abstract, wisdom, benevolence, courage as examples of cardinal virtues.</p><p><i>Budo</i> <span class='ja'>武道</span> is field of martial arts, but it doesn't cover all martial arts.  According to The Budo Charter, budo are Japanese martial ways that have been transformed and evolved from combat techniques (<i>jutsu</i>) into ways of self-development (<i>dou</i>).  There are only nine such martial arts: judo <span class='ja'>柔道</span>, kendo <span class='ja'>剣道</span>, kyudo (archery) <span class='ja'>弓道</span>, sumo <span class='ja'>相撲</span>, karatedo <span class='ja'>空手道</span>, aikido <span class='ja'>合気道</span>, shorinji kempo <span class='ja'>少林寺拳法</span>, naginata <span class='ja'>なぎなた</span>, and jukendo <span class='ja'>銃剣道</span>.  </p><p>As mentioned in the abstract, most of these martial arts carry the kanji suffix <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>, which identifies them as a path to self-improvement.  Many other arts in Japan also carry this suffix, such as tea ceremony or <i>sado</i> <span class='ja'>茶道</span>, calligraphy or <i>shodo</i> <span class='ja'>書道</span>, and flower arrangement, or <i>kado</i> <span class='ja'>華道</span>/<span class='ja'>花道</span>.  I don't really understand why iaido <span class='ja'>居合道</span> isn't a budo art, but I guess that's because it's not meant as a means for combat?  Or perhaps it doesn't stem from a former form of combat?</p><p>Despite being different forms of combat, training, and practice, budo martial arts are all connected by the same virtues of self-development and self-improvement.  If a martial art does not follow these virtues, and doesn't set one on the path to self-improvement, it is not considered <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>.  In that case, they are pure fighting techniques, or <i>jutsu</i> <span class='ja'>術</span>.  The virtues of those martial arts and sports are different.</p><p>Because all forms of <i>dou</i> carry the same virtues and basic fundamentals, scholars consider this the reason why so many military commanders and famous swordsman of the past were also great poets, musicians, and writers.  They had some deep connections with themselves and could easily express it.</p><p>This is also why many budo practitioners these days have ranks in multiple branches of budo or other Japanese arts, rather than only one course of study.</p><div class='title'><b>3 important Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>After reading that description and beginning the lecture, I really wanted a straight list of virtues.  I wanted something like, "The cardinal virtues of Japan are…"  But that's not how it went.  Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned that there would not be enough time to mention all the virtues of Japan, and explain why they were so revered.</p><p>Looking through my notes of the lecture, and from what I remember, he focused on 3 particular virtues he found as important.</p><p>- <span class='ja'>礼</span> <i>rei</i> - respect and gratitude<br/>- <span class='ja'>文武両道</span> <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> - the balance between strength and wisdom<br/>- <span class='ja'>無</span> <i>mu</i> - nothingness</p><div class='title'><b>Rei <span class='ja'>礼</span></b></div><p>Physically, <i>rei</i> is the act of bowing.  It's an expression of the importance of order, and an outward expression of our inner <b>respect</b>.  It's a sign that we should love and respect other people, rather than hate.  All human relations are founded on the two principles of <i>shinrai</i>, people trusting and being friendly to each other, and <i>sonkei</i>, acknowledging and respecting those different from you.  And physically bowing to someone is an expression of both.</p><p>As an example, it is respectful for hosts to please their guests.  It's their duty to go above and beyond the capabilities of their guest and impress them.  And it's respectful for guests to acknowledge and show gratitude for everything the host has done for them.  Even if they disappoint, it is always the guest's duty to return the same magnitude of respect to the host.  In that same vain, bowing is also a show of <b>gratitude</b> and thanks.</p><p>In his lecture, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> brought to the topic to respect on the battlefield, or <i>gunjin no rei</i> <span class='ja'>軍陣の礼</span>.  Though, battlefields and war refer more to the fighting done in the warring states period of Japan, not necessarily modern warfare.  Before a battle or fight, bowing to your opponents shows mutual respect for each other as warriors.  Bowing at the end, signifies a return to the state outside on conflict.  It was a way to preserve our humanity even in the face of conflict, and separates us from animals.</p><p>Without bowing on the battlefield, we're nothing but blood-thirsty war-mongering people.  Winning a battle or war at all costs, and dehumanizing and humiliating the enemy is a sign of cowardice and disrespect.  These kind of people are not human, and should be dealt with like animals.</p><div class='title'><b>The Balance between Strength and Wisdom</b></div><p>There's a Japanese term called <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> <span class='ja'>文武両道</span>.  As long time ago, it meant being accomplished in both literary and military arts, or, that all military training should be correctly balanced with scholarship.</p><p>Today, the meaning has changed a little.  Now the translation means having both <b>strength</b> and <b>wisdom</b>.  It basically means the same thing, but the military and fighting connotation has been removed.  This change was influenced by western thought thanks to terms like "the pen is mightier than the sword."</p><p>The forces of strength and wisdom are often depicted with red and blue colors.  In popular culture, these colors often depict characters that represent strength or wisdom, such as the power rangers.  If you remember the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the red ranger was the leader of the group, and always the strongest.  He is usually not smart, but feels passion and emotion which often leads him into combat.  The blue ranger, while not necessarily the weakest of the rangers, was certainly the smartest.</p><p>But, strength doesn't mean to simply have physical strength.  Strength also refers to their strength of ones heart and will.  It's the ability to love and compassion.  Without this kind of strength, a person is just blood thirsty.  True warriors fight with compassion.</p><p>You can see this ALL the time in Shonen Jump series such as Dragonball and One Piece.  Goku and Luffy often lack the wisdom side of the coin, but their strength always comes their compassion for their friends, or what is just or right.  They never enter into a fight for no reason.</p><div class='title'><b>Nothingness <span class='ja'>無</span></b></div><p>The goal for any budo practitioner is to be able to perform moves and actions naturally and without thinking.  This is known as a state of <i>jizai</i> <span class='ja'>自在</span>, or naturality.  How is this done?  One way is to achieve this state of nothingness.</p><p>By nothingness I mean that the practitioner wishes to have a simple state of being.  This can be done through the unification of the following 3 states of consciousness:  <b>sincerity</b>, <b>selflessness</b>, and being able to <b>free the mind of thoughts</b>.</p><p>Following these states, the practitioner is able to free themselves of themselves.  Their own ego, wants, and desires are no longer in their way, and everything becomes instinct, and natural.</p><p>True masters and experts strive for this ideal state of character, and can achieve these states at will.</p><p>This aligns with true virtues:  the virtue of <b>honesty</b> or <i>shoujiki</i> <span class='ja'>正直</span>, and the virtue of <b>purity of spirit</b>, or <i>seijou</i> <span class='ja'>清浄</span>.  The lecturer make a point by saying, "I believe these are the most important of the virtues."</p><div class='title'><b>The Book of Japanese Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>Not quite being satisfied from my notes of the lecture, I wanted to know all of the cardinal virtues of Japan.  I wanted the finish this sentence: "The cardinal virtues of Japan are …"  Fortunately, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> literally wrote the book on the subject.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lecture was actually just a small snippet of what he wrote about.  Though, the book isn't just an answer to "What are the Cardinal Virtues of Japan?"  It's a published account of all personality traits found good and desirable in Japan in different circumstances and situations, how they've been developed, and how they relate to budo culture in most cases.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I can't actually read it.  But, I can translate the table of contents and form a decent list of what's inside.  The contents are split into 4 sections: order and harmony, world citizenship, self-development, and objects of self-improvement.</p><div class='title'><b>Order <i>chitsujo</i> <span class='ja'>秩序</span> and Harmony <i>wagou</i> <span class='ja'>和合</span></b></div><p>These virtues mostly deal with the inner expression of yourself.  These are your thoughts and feelings about the world around you, and how you conduct your life.  Some of these are also outward expressions that demonstrate or convey your inner thoughts and ideals.</p><p><span class='ja'>側隠の心</span> <i>sokuin no kokoro</i><br/><b>Compassion of the Heart</b> or "showing sympathy or pity."  Apparently <i>sokuin</i> has more of a negative connotation, so I think "pity" is better.  But, that doesn't really make sense.  Wouldn't the ideal be showing compassion and sympathy for others by not looking down on them?  Being one with them, and looking past any ego driven or vain thoughts about yourself?</p><p><span class='ja'>敬</span> - <span class='ja'>「うやまう」「つつしむ」</span> <i>kei</i> - <i>uyamau tsutsushimu</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b>.  Being able to show respect <i>uyamau</i> to other people, and being modest <i>tsutsushimu</i> about your own achievements.  This is the same kanji used in <i>keigo</i> <span class='ja'>敬語</span>, which is the honorific / respectful words and language used in Japanese.</p><p><span class='ja'>清浄</span> <i>seijou</i> <br/> <b>Purity</b> - pure of heart / innocence (like a baby)</p><p><span class='ja'>礼</span> - <span class='ja'>天地の序</span> <i>rei</i> - <i>techi no ji</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b> and <b>Gratitude</b>.  This was already mentioned above, but it's the idea of performing things in a set order.  The act of bowing preludes heaven and earth.</p><p><span class='ja'>倹約</span> - <span class='ja'>均衡</span> - <span class='ja'>調和の知恵</span> <i>kenyaku</i> - <i>kinkou</i> - <i>chouwa no chie</i> <br/> <b>Frugality - Balance - Harmony of Wisdom</b>.  This is the idea that simplicity is best.  You should rid yourself of unnecessary things in your daily life, and only live with what is needed.  You must manage overindulgence.</p><div class='title'><b>World Citizenship <span class='ja'>世の中の一員</span></b></div><p>These virtues are about yourself outward expression to the world.  This is how someone should conduct themselves as a member of their community, society, and the world.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> - <span class='ja'>百行の本</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>hyakkou no moto</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> - the foundation of all actions.  Filial Piety means your undying loyalty to your parents and family, and essentially having the capacity to support them as they have supported you.  Apparently, this is foundations of all of our actions in our lives.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> (<span class='ja'>続</span>) - <span class='ja'>親子の真実</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>oyako no shinjitsu</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> (continued) - the nature of the relationship between parent and child.</p><p><span class='ja'>勤勉</span> - <span class='ja'>世のため人のための徳</span> <i>kinben</i> - <i>yo no tame hito no tame no toku</i> <br/> <b>Diligence</b>.  This is the virtue of people who do things for the greater good of the world.  Those that work hard everyday at what they do.</p><p><span class='ja'>義</span> - <span class='ja'>人間の条件</span> <i>gi</i> - <i>ningen no jouken</i> <br/> <b>Morality</b> or <b>Justice</b> - the human condition.  Members of yakuza gangs use the term <i>gi</i> to describe the rules they enforce in the public and among themselves.</p><p><span class='ja'>信義</span> - <span class='ja'>公共の精神</span> <i>shingi</i> - <i>koukyou no seishin</i> <br/> <b>Trust</b> / <b>Faith</b> / <b>Loyalty</b> - the spirit of common sense.  This means having faith in society that they'll do the right things, and by being a member of society that you uphold that faith of common sense.</p><p><span class='ja'>分別</span> - <span class='ja'>大人の道徳</span> <i>bunbetsu</i> - <i>otona no doutoku</i> <br/> <b>Judgement</b> (or <b>Discrimination</b>) - the morals and ethics of adults.</p><div class='title'><b>Self-development <span class='ja'>自己を育てる</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>誠</span> - <span class='ja'>修行の思想</span> <i>makoto</i> - <i>shugyou no shisou</i> <br/><b>Honesty</b> or <b>Integrity</b> - the ideals of <i>shugyou</i> training.  Translating <i>shugyou</i> only as 'training' loses a lot of its meaning.  <i>Shugyou</i> training is strict self-disciplined mental and physical training like a samurai.  Examples would be doing the same disciplined training everyday exactly the same to achieve perfection.  Or, there's the example of a samurai sitting and meditating under a waterfall.  The purpose is to try and attain a state of zen or a state of <i>mu</i>.  It's these ideals that establish integrity.</p><p><span class='ja'>忠</span> - <span class='ja'>普遍的価値への奉仕</span> <i>chuu</i> - <i>fuhen-teki-kachi e no houshi</i> <br/><b>Loyalty</b> - devoting oneself to the universal values of loyalty.</p><p><span class='ja'>和</span> - <span class='ja'>『憲法十七条』の精神</span> <i>wa</i> - <i>[kenpou 17 jou] no seshin</i><br/> <b>Harmony</b> - the spirit of the Seventeen-article constitution.  The Seventeen-article constitution is a document written by Prince Shoutoku Taishi in 604.  It was a highly Buddhist and Confucian inspired set of morals and virtues that were to be expected of government officials and the emperor's subjects.  An excerpt from Wikipedia states, "Harmony is to be valued, and the avoidance of wanton opposition to be honored."</p><p><span class='ja'>克己</span> - <span class='ja'>忍耐</span> - <span class='ja'>現代に最もっとも必要な徳</span> <i>kokki</i> - <i>nintai</i> - <i>gendai ni sai motto mo hitsuyou na toku</i> <br/><b>Self-Control</b> - <b>Patience</b> - the most necessary trait in our modern age.</p><p><span class='ja'>定心</span> - <span class='ja'>存心</span> - <span class='ja'>正念</span> - <span class='ja'>正気に返れ</span> <i>joushin</i> - <i>zonshin</i> - <i>shounen</i> - <i>shouki ni kaere</i><br/><b>Meditation</b>, <b>Feelings from the heart</b>, and <b>True Faith</b>.  Meditation is the spirit of Buddhism.  You rid yourself of all distractions and focus your mind on a single thought.  You keep yourself in a free state, void of feeling, or a level feelings.  It's like a state of nothingness.  You try to achieve a state of zen.  True Faith is being able to control or correct your bad feelings, and bring in good feelings.</p><p><span class='ja'>怨望</span> - <span class='ja'>日本人の弱点</span> <i>enpou</i> - <i>nihonjin no jakuten</i><br/> <b>Envy</b> - a Japanese weakness.  The first kanji is also used for the verb <i>uramu</i> <span class='ja'>怨む</span>, which means to have a grudge against someone.  But, this boils down to resentment, jealousy.  There's a really common utterance in Japanese: <span class='ja'>いいな</span>.  Directly, it's translates as "that's good," or "that's awesome," but it carries a sense of wanting with it, like, "I want that to," or "I wish I had that, too."  I'm not sure if including this virtue is an example of something bad, or if it's just part of being Japanese, good or bad.</p><p><span class='ja'>勇</span> - <span class='ja'>肉体に根ざす徳</span> <i>yuu</i> - <i>nikutai ni nezasu toku</i><br/> <b>Bravery</b> or <b>Courage</b> - the fundamental trait that makes up the human body.</p><p><span class='ja'>仁</span> - <span class='ja'>生命のものの徳</span> <i>jin</i> - <i>seimei no mono mo toku</i><br/> <b>Benevolence</b> or consideration and compassion for other people.  Humanity.  This is the virtue of all existence and life in general.</p><p><span class='ja'>志</span> - <span class='ja'>人生の司令塔</span> <i>kokorozashi</i> - <i>jinsei no shireitou</i><br/> <b>Intention</b> or <b>Motive</b> - the central drive or direction that controls our lives, or your reason for doing the things you do.</p><p><span class='ja'>『教育勅語』の徳目</span> <i>[kyouiku chokugo] no tokume</i><br/><b>Types of virtues taken from the "Imperial Rescript of Education"</b>.  The Imperial Rescript was kind of like the Pledge of a Allegiance in the US.  It was something that all school children (prior to World War II) would read and say in school.  It requested that people advance public good and promote common interests, always respect the constitution and observe the laws, and should emergency arise, offer yourself to defend and maintain the prosperity of the Imperial Throne.  These days, Japanese people consider this nationalist train of thought dangerous as it lead to the mistakes of war.</p><div class='title'><b>The Objective of Self-improvement <span class='ja'>修養の目標</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>男一匹</span> - <span class='ja'>新渡戸稲造の修養論</span> <i>otoko ippiki</i> - <i>Nitobe Inazou no shouyou ron</i><br/><b>The perfection of masculinity</b> - Nitobe Inazou's idea of self-improvement.  This is the ideal that every Japanese man wants to be.</p><p><span class='ja'>すてきなひと</span> - <span class='ja'>女性らしさの徳</span> <i>suteki na hito</i> - <i>josei rashisa no toku</i><br/><b>"Beautiful" Person</b> - feminine virtues.</p><p><span class='ja'>三種の神器</span> - <span class='ja'>政治家の徳</span> <i>sanshu no jingo</i> - <i>seijika no toku</i><br/><b>Three Sacred Treasures</b> - the virtues required of politicians.  These are honesty <span class='ja'>正直</span> <i>shoujiki</i>, compassion <span class='ja'>慈悲</span> <i>jihi</i>, and wisdom <span class='ja'>知恵</span> <i>chie</i>.</p><p><span class='ja'>老木の花</span> - <span class='ja'>亀の甲より年の功</span> <i>rouboku no hana</i> - <i>kame no koi yori toshi no koi</i><br/>(<b>Idioms</b>) The Flower of an Old Tree - wise old man wisdom from a turtle shell.  These are virtues found from idioms, or wise old sayings passed down by generations.  Heeding this wisdom shows respect to the elderly.</p><p><span class='ja'>無私</span> - <span class='ja'>徳の大きさ</span> <i>mushi</i> - <i>toku no okisa</i><br/><b>Nothingness</b> - the size of a virtue.</p><p><span class='ja'>中庸</span> -<span class='ja'>「普通」</span>- <span class='ja'>こそが究極の徳</span> <i>chuuyou</i> - <i>[futsuu]</i> - <i>koso ga kyuukyoku no toku</i><br/><b>The Golden Mean</b> - <b>Normality</b> or being average - virtues of the ultimate goal.  This is about sticking to the group, and not being extreme.  But, it can also mean being fair, and not taking sides.  Ultimately, this idea came from China.</p><div class='title'><b>Translation</b></div><p>The book is quite dense.  It'd be like a Japanese person trying to translate a bible into their language.  Some of these virtues deal with the roots of modern day Japanese culture stemming from China.  Others are wholly formed Japanese ideals.  One easy way to identify traits stemming directly from Japanese ideals are the words that use a single kanji.  Usually words with two or three kanji stem directly from Chinese kanji.</p><div class='title'><b>Balance</b></div><p>Out of everything, I found the topic of balancing strength and wisdom particularly important to me.  Not being able to fully understand Japanese (and perhaps the way they train junior high students) has made me miss a lot of the theory and thought process behind the moves and training I've done thus far.  Even the written test makes the test-takers only memorize the words written, but not actually think of their own answers.</p><p>The lecture on the following day mentioned that one cannot learn a budo art by training alone.  Someone who only trains technique and only builds physical strength and speed will never be on the same level as someone who balances training both their body and mind.</p><p>This conference was immensely valuable to me because of this.  It identified my largest weakness in learning kendo so far.  The idea of always training in kendo doesn't necessarily make you better at kendo.  Improving aspects of your life, and bringing balance to everything will improve your skills as well.</p><p>Good habits in your life are brought into your budo, just as the bad habits, too.  If you're a well-organized person, those ideals are brought into your performance.  If you're a slouch or a sloppy person, those ideals are also brought in, too.  Kendo and other budo arts are an expression of your inner self, and your moves and techniques mirror those ideals.  This is what your opponent sees when faced against you.  </p><p>And things I improve in kendo translate back in my life.  Kendo is no longer just something that I do.  Kendo is who am I.  It's a part of me.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kendo Ni-dan Test" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kendo-ni-dan-test">Kendo Ni-dan Test</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Though, using the black belt as a metaphor, I think some people consider a black belt as some kind of master level status, but that's not the case.  A first level black belt, or a Shodan grade, means that you've successfully demonstrated that you know and can perform the basics and the core of the martial art.  You've really only mastered the basics, and now the world is open to you.</p><p>Ni-dan is really just a stepping stone.  I wouldn't say that it's a formality, though.  I feel like achieving ni-dan shows that you've successfully demonstrated your capacity and motivation to continue learning and growing in the art.   I don't feel like ni-dan has a true bar of skill for itself.  It's more of a check-in to see whether or not you are continuing correctly.  And that if you continue your path, it's possible for you to attain san-dan, or 3rd dan, in 2 years.</p><p>I think that's the next true step in Kendo.  Shodan is the first step.  With that you've become a true practitioner of Kendo.  But with 3-dan, you've become a professional.  You're an athlete.  It's no longer just enough for me to get the title and become that rank.  I need to build myself.  I need to train.  I need to take exercise and health seriously.  I need to become the ideal of that rank to get that title.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kendo Shodan Test" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kendo-shodan-test">Kendo Shodan Test</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 25, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been about a month, but on Nov 16th, I took and passed my Shodan level Kendo examination. :D</p><p>I wrote a little bit about this leading up to the exam on <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  Shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, or "first dan", and the first level of dan mastery in Kendo.  Dan mastery is somewhat similar to the black belt scale in Karate.  So, achieving Shodan is similar to a first level black belt.  There are no belts or additional decoration used in Kendo, though.</p><p>Prior to dan mastery, there is kyuu mastery, which is reserved for beginners of Kendo, usually elementary students, and beginning junior high students.</p><div class='title'><b>Examination Day</b></div><p>The test was held at Big Arena on Sunday Nov 16th.  The doors to Big Arena opened at 8am, and there were plenty of students waiting by the doors before then.  Additionally, there were basketball and table tennis tournaments held that day, too.  The Kendo test was held in the martial arts hall within the complex.</p><p>As the doors opened, everyone filled into the building.  I went upstairs and into the testing area.  Several of the beginner students I practice with were there taking the Kyuu tests for the first time.  One of my former students was there taking the "second dan" test, ni-dan <span class='ja'>二段</span>.  I had been practicing with him for the past month in preparation. :)</p><p>Everyone registered for their respective tests, and paid their fees.  The Shodan test was almost 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($100).</p><div class='title'><b>Kyuu Examination <span class='ja'>級審査</span></b></div><p>The Kyuu-level tests began at 9am.  They first began with correct execution of the Kendo waza techniques.  These are a series of moves performed with another test taker.  One acts as the attacker.  The other as the defender.  Then when complete they switch roles.  These are performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span> (wooden sword), and without any protective gear.  The moves are performed in a deliberate and methodical way to correctly show one's understanding of how the move is to be correctly executed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" /></p><p>Secondly, the test takers are evaluated on moves performed in real-time.  These moves are performed with all the gear worn by the test taker, and with a shinai <span class='ja'>竹刀</span> (bamboo sword).  Same as the first test, test takers perform these moves on each other.  One is the attacker.  The other is the defender.  Then they switch.  Additionally, for "first kyuu", or Ikkyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span>, the test ends with both test takers performing as many moves as they can against each other in a "practice" match.  The lower levels don't require this.</p><p>As the different kyuu-level tests complete, the results are posted on the wall, the taker's kendo licenses are stamped and certificates are handed out.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Examination <span class='ja'>段審査</span></b></div><p>Once all the Kyuu tests were complete, then the Dan tests finally began.  I think our tests began 10:30.  There are 3 tests, and each is immediate elimination.  Meaning: if you fail a test, you do not continue.  I was most worried about the first test.</p><p>The first test is a practice shiai <span class='ja'>試合</span>, or match, but it's performed much differently than in a tournament.  In this match, when you meet your opponent, you carefully study their posture, their movements, and their feelings.  When you understand your opponent, then you can interpret intentions, and correctly strike and respond to their movements.  </p><p>My biggest problem with doing this part of the test is my bulky slow-ass giant body.  These junior high kids are way too fast for me.  For some students, I can see their attacks coming, but I can't parry and counter fast enough to make a valid strike.  Other times, I can't even see their attacks coming because they whip around their shinai so fast.</p><p>This test isn't about winning or losing, though.  Reading your opponent is certainly key.  But more important is that you follow through with your movements to completion.  At least, that's how I understand it.  I think there are other factors at play, too.</p><p>For this test, examinees perform twice against two other examinees, and each match is one minute.  That's it.  As usual, I was in the last group.  I took my turn, and performed the test as I understood it.  I was certainly nervous, but I had been practicing so much over the past 2 months, and regularly practicing with students of similar level that it really didn't bother me as much as it did during the previous test.  I knew what to do.</p><p>So, I passed the first part of the test without a problem.  I was slow a couple of times, but I guess I was sufficient where it mattered.</p><div class='title'><b>Part 2 and 3</b></div><p>After more than an hour lunch break, we continued the test with the reminder of the test takers.  All the kyuu-level examinees were already gone at this point, so the crowd of parents was pretty sparse.</p><p>Part 2 is correctly performing dan-level waza, which are higher-level kendo techniques performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span>.  I had been practicing these so much over the previous 3-4 months that they were completely internalized.  All the kendo instructors kept putting such an importance on them that I don't think I could ever forgot them.  During the test, though, we only needed to perform one side of the waza.  We were random chosen to either be attacker or defender, and that was it.  All examinees passed.</p><p>Part 3 of the test was the written exam.  This is what I wrote about before: <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  There are 4 questions total on the test chosen from a pool of 6.  Each examinee basically needed to memorize the answer, and write it down on the test.  You didn't need to write it in your own words.  And didn't need to write anything dealing with comprehension.  Only memorization.  (In my opinion, that doesn't really teach anything, but whatever.)</p><p>My written test was completely in English because I'm terrible at Japanese.  The English answers for the test were somewhat based on my translation of the booklet, too, so memorizing the answers was pretty easy (since they were written in my voice).  I was able to completely memorize the 6 questions within two days on the test.  Apparently, when grading my test, the proctor had commented that I had written everything 100% perfect.</p><p>So, I passed. :)  So too did everyone else that made it to this point.</p><p>I am one of perhaps ten or twenty foreigners to ever take and pass the Shodan exam in Gifu-ken.</p><div class='title'><b>Success!</b></div><p>I was rather nervous about whether I could pass the test, but a lot of that nervousness turned into confidence as the test drew closer.  I had been training every day leading up to the test, and was doing everything nearly perfect during practice.  My waza was totally perfect a few weeks prior to the test.  And I knew I could memorize the written part.  This was my third time taking a kendo exam, too, so I knew what to expect, and how to deal with things.  I didn't want to be too confident and have that turn to arrogance...  but I knew I could pass.  </p><p>Some of the student's parents were pretty confident I could pass as well.  They called the newspaper prior to the test so they could interview me and write an article about me.  The reporter asked me rather standard questions.  "How do you feel?" "How long have you done Kendo?" "Why do you do Kendo?" etc.  They asked my Kendo instructor questions as well.</p><p>It appeared in the Takayama newspaper the next day:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This brought me plenty of attention.</p><p>My student's parents read the newspaper, and noticed me.  The next day at school, all the students made comments about it, and congratulated me.  <span class='ja'>ジム先生、初段におめでとう</span>!  Some parents made their kids memorize their congratulations in English, and recite it to me.  Several teachers made a big deal out of it, too, making the whole class congratulate me before we started.  Plenty of students knew that I practiced and performed Kendo after school, but now everyone knew.</p><p>On Friday, a reporter from the Hida section of the Gifu newspaper wanted to write an article of their own.  They came to school, and interviewed me for about an hour.  She asked the same questions, but with more depth.</p><p>Again, the next day, it appeared in the paper:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between both these articles, I don't actually know the extent of what they wrote, since I'm terrible at Japanese.  It's also difficult for me to fully articulate myself when I can't do it in Japanese, and the person doesn't completely understand English.  As such, I don't think my responses were really all that interesting.  Nor can I really tell if they printed some shit about me.  (I did notice in the first article that I'm from Australia.)</p><p>This newspaper reaches A LOT more people than the Takayama paper.  Plus, it was the top story in this section of the newspaper, and it took up about a quarter of the page.</p><p>Now, everyone in my daily life knew that I did Kendo, and couldn't wait to congratulate me.  Teachers in other schools that I hadn't met, congratulated me.  The employees working at the convenience stores, grocery stores, gas station, and dry cleaning places I regularly visit, all recognized me in the paper and congratulated me the next time I went there.  Even the delivery man made a comment after dropping off a package.  <span class='ja'>いつもおめでとう</span>.  <span class='ja'>剣道をがんばってましょう</span>.</p><p>It wasn't that I hated the attention.  I mean, I already stand out quite a bit as a foreigner, which gives me attention on its own.  This is now yet another way of people paying attention to me.  Too much attention.  It was all positive attention, though, so I'm thankful for that. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Kendo continues to be amazing for me in Takayama, so I will absolutely continue to improve myself, and climb the rankings ladder.  After shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, the next level of mastery is nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span>, or "second dan."  The rules of ranking prohibit anyone from taking the nidan exam until one year after achieving shodan.  So, I won't be able to get nidan until November 2015.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, maybe 10 or 20 foreigners have gotten shodan in Gifu in the past.  Maybe 1 or 2 have gotten nidan.  None have ever gotten sandan <span class='ja'>三段</span> (third dan).  I don't think that's necessarily because of a skill-gap, or difficulty gap (though, I could be wrong.)  Nidan seems almost identical to Shodan, with the addition of more waza, and some different questions on the test.</p><p>I think the biggest gap is time.  Most ALTs only stay in Japan for 3 years at the most.  It's not that usual for someone to stay 4 or 5 years (which is the absolute max).  Between shodan and nidan, you must wait a year.  Between nidan and sandan, you must wait 2 years.  At this point, if I pass my nidan test next year, and stay for a 5th year, my sandan test would be after my contract is finished in Takayama.  I'm not sure where I'll be in November 2017, but it won't be Takayama.</p><p>I definitely plan on getting nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span> next year.  From there, I plan on continuing Kendo all the way up until I leave Takayama.  Hopefully where I am after, I will have the means to continue, then return to Takayama for the sandan test.  Who knows, though.  A lot can happen in the next 2 1/2 years.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gifu Kendo Exam Question Workbook" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gifu-kendo-exam-question-workbook-progress">Gifu Kendo Exam Question Workbook</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 11, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In Gifu prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span> when taking a dan <span class='ja'>段</span> level examination for kendo <span class='ja'>剣道</span>, one of the components is a written test.  The Gifu Kendo Federation provides a book which details all the questions and answers they use for this test.  </p><p>I will take the test in November, and unfortunately for me, it's all in Japanese.  So, I translated the book into English, and then made a few edits with a kendo dictionary after.</p><p><i>Currently</i>, this is a work in progress.  I've completely translated the first 3 parts.  But for the 4th part of the book, I only translated the shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span> level questions for now.  I'll do the rest after November.</p><p>You can download my translation and take a look for yourselves, at the following link:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYXdSTmM5TzZFTGs/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYXdSTmM5TzZFTGs/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs/ <span class='ja'>剣道学科審査問題集</span> Kendo Exam Question Workbook - WOP-2014-09-11.pdf</a></p><p>It's a PDF.  Also, the size of the paper is a Japanese B4 size, which is 257 mm (10.12 in) by 364 mm (14.33 in), and it's currently 18 pages.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6373.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6375.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6375.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>Kendo is one of the oldest forms of martial arts in Japan.  It literally translates as "way of the sword," and across Japan tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of elementary, junior high, high school, college students, and regular citizens practice or have practiced Kendo at some point in their life.</p><p>I began practicing Kendo in April 2013 when the junior high school I taught at continued to ask me to join them in their practices.  It's been great exercise, great stress relief, and I've met so many people throughout the community through this sport.</p><p>Much like every martial art, Kendo has an idea of ranking, similar to the black belt system in Karate.  Kendo has two levels of mastery, Kyuu <span class='ja'>級</span>, and Dan <span class='ja'>段</span>.  To achieve these ranks, you must take an exam.  And in Gifu prefecture <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span>, these exams are proctored by the Gifu-ken Kendo Association.  They visit the Takayama area 4 times a year.</p><p>The first level, kyuu <span class='ja'>級</span>, builds up from higher number to lower.  So, 1-kyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span> is the highest rank on the kyuu scale.  From there, the next level is dan <span class='ja'>段</span>, in which numbers increase.</p><div class='title'><b>Not Ranked</b></div><p>You gotta start somewhere.  If you're a junior high school student, or older, when taking the test for the first time, the requirements are similar to the 1-kyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span> test.  Afterward, the judges will assign a grade to you.</p><p>I took the unranked exam in November last year.  My exam had two parts.  I had to perform all 9 waza for kihon-waza with a bukkuto.  Then needed to perform a series of moves attacking an opponent.</p><p>Kihon-waza are a series of movements in kendo that are practiced slowly and methodically.  This series are some of the most basic moves you can perform within a kendo match.  Performing them in this way teaches correct posture, body movement, foot movement, and shinai movement.</p><p>Here's a youtube clip of the waza being performed:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ</a></p><p>Additionally, you must perform some moves in realtime against an opponent.  For unranked, I had to perform kiri-kaeshi, men-no-uchi, kote-men-no-uchi, men-kaeshi-dou, and men-suriage-men.</p><p>I messed up the men-suriage-men.  They blamed it on my opponent, though, and let me try again.  Again, I messed it up, so they realized it was my fault not his.</p><p>But overall, I was awarded 2-kyuu <span class='ja'>二級</span>!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" /></p><p>This put me on the same level as the 5th grade elementary students I practiced with each week.  Actually, many of my students were taking the exam as well, and got 2-kyuu, too!</p><div class='title'><b>1-Kyuu Exam <span class='ja'>一級</span></b></div><p>In June this year, I took the 1-kyuu exam.  This test had 3 parts.  It had the same 2 parts from the unranked tests: the kihon-waza, and the series of real-time moves.  In addition, I also had to take part in an example shiai, or match.</p><p>Within the match, I had to demonstrate how I attack and strike my opponent, and show as much variety as possible.  I didn't need to win, or get as many valid strikes as possible.  I just need to demonstrate I knew how to initiate attacks, reacts to incoming attacks, and that all my movements were in sync.</p><p>I think I was a little stiff in some actions, but my mind was 100% centered on the moves I was performing, and what was happening within the match.  I tuned out everything around me, and forgot about the world.  It was only my opponent and myself that existed.  It may have been the first time I actually felt this way.  Usually, I'm very conscious of instruction, and how I look performing these moves, but I couldn't focus on that.  I pushed it all out of my mind.  </p><p>I did all this MAINLY because I was the last person to do this test.  They put me in the back because I was so tall and couldn't "measure" to the other test takers.  So, no one else was in line behind me.  Everyone else had already finished.  I was the only one on the floor, and all the other participants, families, judges, and whomever else were all watching me.  Maybe 200 people?</p><p>I do get a little stage fright in front of so many people, but this is compounded.  Everyone is Japanese.  I'm the only white guy here.  I stand out quite a bit (literally).  And I'm the only white guy, in the history of Takayama (possibly in all Gifu), to do Kendo and take these tests.  The nervousness of failing or succeeding or looking dumb or just looking anything was just too great because it felt like I was representing more than just myself.</p><p>So I had to tune it out.  Which is what I should being doing a match in the first place.</p><p>And my concentration paid off.  I achieved the rank of 1-kyuu!  Along with all my students, both elementary and junior high. :D</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span></b></div><p>Having mastered kyuu, the next level of mastery of dan.  The first level is shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>.  The requirements for shodan are completely different than that of kyuu.  There are 3 parts.  </p><p>There's a new set of waza that must be learned.  These are Nippon Kendo Kata.  For shodan, only the first 5 waza must be performed.  These feature very advanced moves, which are more complicated and intricate than the kihon-waza from before.</p><p>You also must perform in several shiai, or matches.  I think they group together 4 test takers, and everyone takes turn battling each other.  Again, I don't think you need to actually win these matches.  Just demonstrate that you can correctly attack and respond with appropriate behavior.</p><p>The third part is the written exam, which is the whole reason for this post.  The exam pulls questions from the following book.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" /></p><p>This is the book I translated.  One questions is always asked, and 2 others are randomly chosen.  I translated all the shodan level stuff, and after giving them the translation, I should be able to answer these questions in English. :)  Also, one of the English teachers I practice kendo with said they'll let him translate my answers back to Japanese for the judges.</p><p>For the next 2 months, I need to continue to practice all this stuff, so I can pass the test.  Ganbattemasu!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Youge (洋ゲー)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/youge">Youge (洋ゲー)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the past 3-4 years gaming has changed considerably.  In 2005, the Xbox 360 was released, and then in 2006, the Playstation 3 and Wii were released.  Obviously, we're in a new era of gaming with which consoles are on the market, but the considerable change has been the paradigm shift from Japan's dominance in game development to Western.  And by Western, I mean Europe and North America, the "western" civilizations.</p><p>From Nintendo's "splash" in America in 1985 with <b>Super Mario Bros.</b>, and later with <b>Legend of Zelda</b>, and <b>Metroid</b> and Sega's <b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b>, Western development had been behind the curve.  Maybe because we never really thought of gaming as a mature medium.  Most western games were lower quality copies of their Japanese counterparts, while Nintendo and Sega were iterating on their ideas.  Capcom created <b>Mega Man</b> and <b>Street Fighter</b>, Konami created <b>Castlevania</b>.</p><p>There were definitely a couple games that were born in Western game development that established genres as well.  ID created <b>Wolfenstein </b>and <b>Doom</b>, Westwood created <b>Command &amp; Conquer</b>, and Blizzard created <b>Warcraft</b>.  But these First Person Shooters and Real Team Strategy games were absolutely foreign to Japan.  There is something distinct and exclusive to Japanese culture that I'm not sure anyone has ever defined.  If something foreign does not resonate with these ideals it will not be adopted.</p><p>Japan is also incredibly nationalistic and narcisistic at times.  It's only natural that when they're on their game, they become full of themselves.  I'm sure this is where the term <b>Youge</b> originated its discriminatory meaning.</p><div class='title'><b>Youge</b></div><p>Youge literally translates as Western Game.  "You-" (<span class='ja'>洋</span>) is the prefix for Western things, and Ge is short for Geemu (<span class='ja'>ゲーム</span>) or Game.  It's discriminatory double meaning has been born out of their dominance and disregard for Western game development.</p><p>From their 20 year dominance over game development, Western Games have been seen as second class in Japan.  32-bit era games and last-gen games like <b>Metal Gear Solid</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time</b>, <b>ICO</b>, <b>Shadow of the Collosus</b>, <b>Okami</b>, <b>Final Fantasy VII </b>and <b>Final Fantasy X </b>did things with story and gameplay that truly brought maturity to gaming.</p><p>For me, everyone of those games I've gotten emotionally attached to.  I cared for the characters and story.  There wasn't any game that came from the Western side of things that made me feel anything beyond the normal enjoyment of the game.</p><p>But that began changing with the Xbox.  Western developers now had a video game platform outside of the PC, and began taking some of Japan's ideas as their own.  Games like <b>Grand Theft Auto 3</b>, <b>Halo</b>, <b>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</b>, and <b>Prince of Persia Sand of Time </b>were mature products that had mass appeal but were uniquely Western.</p><p>In today's era, there have been an incredibly few Japanese games that have done anything interesting. <b> Dead Rising</b>, <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess </b>and <b>Super Mario Galaxy </b>are just about it.  They stand along-side far more Western games such as <b>Halo 3</b>, <b>Mass Effect</b>, <b>Oblivion</b>, <b>Bioshock</b>, <b>Grand Theft Auto 4</b>, <b>Dead Space</b>, <b>Fallout 3</b>, <b>Batman Arkham Asylum</b>, and <b>Dragon Age</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japan needs to get over it</b></div><p>Kotaku had an article this morning translating Youichi Wada's (CEO of Square Enix) news report about their upcoming release of <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b> and the recent worldwide release of <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> (<a href="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory" title="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory">here</a>).  He says that Japan needs to get over this discriminatory meaning.  Western games are truly leading the world, and Japan has got to face facts and recognize their success.</p><p>Wada isn't the only one.  Keiji Inafune said the exact same thing during Tokyo Game Show this year, exclaiming, <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/">Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished.</a>"  Evolve or die.</p><p>Final Fantasy XIII will definitely be a test for Japan.  Will a game that pure Japanese have the worldwide appeal that it's had in the past?  Will XIII inspire game development the way VII and X have before?  I really wonder if I'll enjoy it having given up on Japanese RPGs.</p><p>I think the only other games worth mentioning on Japan's horizon are <b>The Last Guardian </b>and <b>Legend of Zelda Wii</b>.  Everything else is just an unoriginal copy-cat.</p><div class='title'><b>The Rise and Fall of Japan</b></div><p>Also, 1up has an amazing article from Sept 2008 about <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938" title="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938">The Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Japan</a> that explains all this far better than I attempted.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, The Japanese have a word for it!</b></div><p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/language-culture/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
