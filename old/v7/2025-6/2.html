| June 28, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Old Ueda Village used to be a key destination on the old Gokayama Highway, leaving the urban area of Tonami City <span class='ja'>砺波町</span> and Johana Town <span class='ja'>城端町</span> and going up into the southwestern mountains of Toyama prefecture. After Ueda Village, there was nothing but the road, the trees, and the climb. Many of the residents made their living catering to these travelers, or by working as porters themselves.</p><p>At the top of the first mountain was <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span></a>, which I wrote about before. The Hosoo Pass and the area is well known for its Postal Corps, a group of housewives and local people employed by the postal service who would cross the mountain every day during winter to deliver the mail. When descending from the pass from the other side, you'd reach <a href="/old/v7/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="/abandoned-nashitani-village">Nashitani Village <span class='ja'>梨谷村</span></a> and then after going over Ose Pass, you'd reach Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> and Shinonashi Village <span class='ja'>下梨村</span>.</p><p>After the war, Japan began to rebuild and became an economic icon. They invested a lot of money into infrastructure, making many of the remote areas more accessible. The Gokayama Highway became Route 304, and as transportation also became stronger, fewer and fewer people were stopping at Ueda before going up the mountain. In 1970, a new Route 304 was established, and now no one traveled through Ueda.</p><p>In 1973, the remaining residents of the Ueda Village all moved away together to the Rikyu area of Johana Town, leaving what was left of their homes to be reclaimed by the forest.</p><p>In 2009, a monument was erected in remembrance of the old village. I put a <a href="/old/v7/ueda-village-translation" title="/ueda-village-translation">transcription and translation</a> of that monument in another post, so you can view the information directly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the village with its credits listed on the back of the monument. On the larger stone monument, a town map has been enshrined. It lists 35 households from 1945 (Showa 20). From research done <a href="/pages/murakage-ueda.html" title="/pages/murakage-ueda.html">Mr. Murakage on his site</a>, Ueda village had 30 homes with 174 people in 1872. The number of homes may have peaked in 1930 with 42 homes. As mentioned above, it was 35 homes in 1945. Murakage says 22 homes in 1946. And only 8 homes in 1948.</p><p>Apparently when Murakage and Hayaneko visited the area in 2011, there were still some wooden remains of a few houses. Today, I couldn't any trace of homes other than some stone foundations and a few bridges that crossed the steam and went no where.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking at the town map again, there are a lot of side roads branching off of old Route 304. The map shows a shrine off in a direction, so I wondered if there were still any traces of that left. Usually people still attend to shrines long after the area is desserted. (Of course, I wasn't able to sight-read the monument, so I didn't know the shrine had folded and its diety moved into town.)</p><p>Across the street from the monument, it did look like there was a path leading into the forest. It was heavily overgrown, but my legs were completely wrapped up and I had my work gloves. I could power through it if the path continued to be noticeable enough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tearing through vines and overgrowth wasn't that bad, and the path continued to lead to a raised clearing which must've been a foundation for a home. So, I figured that I must have been going the right way. Although, looking at the map, it was clearly not. The path to the shrine went up a bit, so I continued up, but the ground was too muddy and unstable. I stepped on the ground, and my foot sunk into a mud hole. Meh, I'm going back. It's probably better to try and run through the woods in fall after the growth has died down.</p><p>I got back in my car and continued driving south going up the mountain. Along the road were several dumping pits for concrete rubble. Further up the road was a construction site for machinery milling out parts of the mountain to create concrete and concrete blocks used for road construction and such.</p><p>The road twisted back on itself and sharply shot up the mountain to reach the current Route 304.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the top of the junction, you could look back down and see just how thick the forests were after so much rain and sun in May and June. Way up in the left corner of that photo, you can see <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span></a>, the ultimate destination of all the porters who lived in Ueda Village when they transported things to Gokayama. By continuing up the new Route 304 (new as of 1970), you'll reach the destination of the porters.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By the way, finding the Ueda (Futatsuya) Village monument took a little bit of research. I had found those webpages of <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko</a> and <a href="/pages/murakage-ueda.html" title="/pages/murakage-ueda.html">Mr. Murakage</a> going to the village in 2011, but it's not marked on the map, and both reports don't actually say where it is. I had a general idea where it was, though, given the location of Hosoo Pass. And just north of Hosoo Pass was Futatsuya River following north into Johana. It had to be along there, but I didn't really have confirmation.</p><p>What I was really looking for was the first image in <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko's Post</a>. There was an old road sign pointing to Ueda two kilometers ahead. This had to be somewhere in southern Johana. I poked around a lot Google Map Street View, and I finally found it. This is at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z" title="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z">36°29'03.5"N 136°53'32.4"E</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" /></a></p><p>Street View had an entry for 2021 and 2012, both of which had the sign removed from its posts. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.webp"/>When I arrived at the location</a>, the posts were no longer in the ground. There was some debris nearby, some piles of loose lumber, possibly from a demolished shed. I found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0369.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0369.webp">an old bus stop sign</a> partially buried in the ground.</p><p>On the way back to my car, I looked over at the shed with metal siding and saw the sign, continuing to rust and decay.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Gifu was still visible, but both towns of Ueda <span class='ja'>上田</span> and Shimonashi <span class='ja'>下梨</span> had decayed. Interesting that those two of the three had been abandoned and decayed themselves.</p><p>After going through Ueda village and back up the mountain, my next location was another abandoned village, <a href="/old/v7/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="/abandoned-nashitani-village">Nashitani Village <span class='ja'>梨谷村</span></a>. Shimonashi was the main village along river, and Nashitani was futher up the mountain between Ose Pass and Hosoo Pass.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Iiyama Temple 飯山寺" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/iiyama-temple">Iiyama Temple 飯山寺</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's now all that remains of the Iiyama family and castle, which was said to be a psuedonymn of Asahina Saburou <span class='ja'>朝比奈三郎</span>.</p><p>I went to the area because I was looking around at locations of castle ruins in Takayama. I had never noticed this before, nor really knew anything about it. Also, Google Maps didn't even have a road going to it, so it seems like an interesting place to investigate.</p><p>To reach the temple, there's an unremarkable unpaved side road that goes up a hill through some farms. The farmland is still being used, so some rice planting equipment was on the side of the road. The narrow roads winds up the hill as most side roads do, and the forest opens up to reveal the temple and a rather large garden with some old folks doing their various gardening.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Being the height of June, all the plants and grass have grown to take over much of the area. There were several historical plaques posted near the temple with each more recent plaque having more detailed information of the history and significance of the temple. I made a separate post with full <a href="/old/v7/iiyama-temple-translations" title="/iiyama-temple-translations">transcriptions and translations</a> of those plaques.</p><p>The legend of the temple begins with Asahina Saburou, a legend of Japanese folklore. After his defeat in the Heiji Rebellion, he apparently fled to Hida and lived in hiding by changing his name to Iiyama. At this location, at the foot of the mountain, he built his castle and estate. Although, the plaque says that the rebellion was in 1159, but Wikipedia says Asahina was born in 1176, so who knows.</p><p>After building his estate, he ultimately came into possession of a statue of the eleven-headed Kannon. He built a hall within his estate to house and display the statue. This hall was named Reishoin <span class='ja'>霊松院</span>. The hall was later refashioned into a temple in 1339 for the statue.</p><p>Later, Miki Yoritsuna (1540-1587) invaded Hida and burned down Iiyama's castle and estate, along with the temple. Miki built <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">Matsukura Castle</a> on the top of that mountain to defend the region.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After the Kanamori Clan swept through Hida and conquered it, Kanamori <span class='ja'>金森長近</span> ordered a Shingon monk to rebuild the temple at its current location, which was said to be where Iiyama Castle and estate once stood. The temple was renamed Toukouzan Iiyama Temple <span class='ja'>東向山飯山寺</span>. This was in 1604.</p><p>In the Edo Period, with Tokugawa Shogunate in full control of Japan, a priest named Genkai <span class='ja'>玄海</span> began the revival of state sanctioned Buddhism. He moved to Takayama and lived in Iiyama Temple as he helped rebuild and shape Kokubunji Temple downtown. He also rebuilt Ichinomiya Shrine to the south. The Buddhism revival attracted many lords and people, so the temple flourished again. The current worship hall at Iiyama Temple was part of Ichinomiya Temple reconstruction, and later moved here.</p><p>Inside the temple, the wooden statue of the eleven-headed Kannon is still there, according to the plaque. All of the doors were closed, and the entrances were covered in screens for protection against animals. For a time, the temple was home to two works by the Japanese Monk, Enku <span class='ja'>円空</span>, both of which are designated as cultural properties of Gifu prefecture. Those works are now on display in the Takayama City Museum.</p><p>Despite the Temple having been largely abandoned, every seven years the temple opens again for the public to view the priceless statues inside. Although, apparently, this practice may have stopped in 2021.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Near the exit to the forest was a small collection of Ojizosama. It seemed like it had been several years since they've been tended to. One of the Jizos didn't even have a face anymore.</p><p>The Ojizosama statues offer two kinds of protection. One of these protections are for children who have died too early in life. As a child's soul passes into the afterlife, it doesn't have its parents to guide them. So, the Jizo-sama protect them like a parent.</p><p>These days, I think the more common protection of these statues is for travelers, which is why you see these statues everywhere when driving around in the mountains. The Jizo-sama protect people traveling long distances and help them reach their destination.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the hill, there are a few more statues and monuments, but many of them had been knocked over by snow melt.

Nowadays, the road to the temple goes directly passed it, so it's only still here for preservation.</p><p>Again, the road leading to the temple is a fairly unremarkable side road off of Route 41. The side road used to be masked by a construction company and their large building, but I feel like they had been slowly going out of business over the last several years. Now, this main building has been completely demolished. Looking through Google, it must've happen in the last 6 months, which is really recent.</p><p>It's remarkable to go around Japan and find pockets of rich history. But, it's also almost just as remarkable how fast they can tear down their modern buildings when their business moves or changes. Living in Takayama for over 12 years, there have been so many changes.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hosoo Pass 細尾峠 &amp; Postal Station Ruins 郵便交換所" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass 細尾峠 &amp; Postal Station Ruins 郵便交換所</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

People living in these villages were largely cut off from the main Japanese society. One of the main transportation routes was along the Sho River <span class='ja'>庄川</span>, but the river only went through mountains in the north. A whole range of mountains encircled the southern end of Johana shielding the town from the valley.</p><p>So, the old Hosoo Pass route was established in 1887 (Meiji 20). It was fairly direct ascent up the mountains, but the road twisted enough that it was smooth travel for people and easy for horses, too. This 10 kilometer route was far more convenient than the 40 kilometer detour north following the river.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Halfway through the road, at the top of Hosoo Pass, you can clearly see Johana Town and the rest of the Takaoka and Tonami area.</p><p>These days that old route is no longer used. In 1927 (Showa 2), the Yahata Road <span class='ja'>八幡道路</span> was completed. It was a paved road that went directly from Johana Town, through Hosoo Pass, and continued to the Taira and Kamitaira villages before ending in Shimonashi village on Sho River. Part of this new road was the Hosoo Pass tunnel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the southern end of Hosoo Pass, continuing to Taira and Shimonashi villages, the old route went over Kakuma Pass <span class='ja'>鹿熊峠</span>, but in 1973, the Nashitani Tunnel <span class='ja'>梨谷トンネル</span> was completed which decommissioned that part of the route. In 1979, construction on the Gokayama Tunnel <span class='ja'>五箇山トンネル</span> began and finished in 1981. The tunnel went directly through the mountains and connected with the Nashitani Tunnel. Yahata Road going through Hosoo Pass was no longer necessary.</p><p>The road is still usable today despite the occasional fallen rocks and branches from the cliffs above. Old folks still drive along the road and clear the debris. Enough preventions have been set to prevent landslides, but eventually there could be a large enough landslide to knock out the road, rendering Hosoo Pass no longer travelable from the north.</p><div class='title'><b>Adventure</b></div><p>A few weeks ago, I traveled to Hosoo Pass. At the time, I knew nothing about the area, so I followed Google Map's suggestions, which lead me to several closed roads, taking too much time, and forcing me to return a few days later. That's the day that I went to that <a href="donohara-winter-branch-school" title="donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School</a>. That branch school was along the Sho River to the north of Shimonashi village.</p><p>On my second trip, I left my house early at 6:30am and arrived at Hosoo Pass around 8am, an hour by highway and 30 minutes on mountain roads. Before exploring the rest of Hosoo Pass and Yahata Road, I took the side path next to Hosoo Tunnel to climb Hakamagoshiyama. I detailed that hike in a <a href="hakamagoshiyama" title="hakamagoshiyama">different post</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Hosoo Pass Tea House Ruins <span class='ja'>細尾峠の茶屋</span></b></div><p>Today it's no longer a spectacle, but next to Hosoo Tunnel was a two story Tea House.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now all that remains are 7 metal posts sticking out of the ground and a bunch of metal garbage behind them. Much of that metal garbage is the old aluminum roof of the building. There was also a refrigerator back there, and a few other things.</p><p>I have no idea when the tea house was built, but it apparently had no running water, nor any electricity of its own. For those people who traveled along the old route in the Meiji and early Showa periods, this had to have been used as a rest stop in the middle of the journey from Johana to Taira or Shimonashi. Later, after it closed, construction companies used it as an office and warehouse.</p><p>Looking around the Internet, I found a webpage that had a photo of the tea house in the year 2001. I copied the page and <a href="/pages/hosoo1.html" title="/pages/hosoo1.html">hosted it here</a> as a backup. You could clearly see the 7 white metal posts holding up the front of the building, but many of the windows have been broken out, and the building doesn't look very safe.</p><p>I found some other photos other sites, too. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp">Here's a photo</a> of less than half of the building remaining from around 2005, I think.

I think, year after year, snow melt continued to push and move the garbage away from the site and down the mountain.</p><div class='title'><b>Hosoo Postal Exchange Ruins <span class='ja'>細尾峠郵便交換所</span></b></div><p>A few hundred meters away from the tunnel and tea house is the ruins of the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange office. Finding this building is not very easy. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Yahata Road curves along the rim of the mountain and has a steep drop off. There's a 3-meter drop to the ground from the road, and the ground is angled at 45 degrees. But apparently there's a trail down there which was the old Hosoo Pass route. Google Maps doesn't mark any kind of entry, but the OSM maps had a trail. And at those coordinates, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp">I found a rope</a>. The rope trails trials off into the brush going nearly straight down.</p><p>On my first trip, I did not believe that was the entry point, but I confirmed it later at home. When I came back on the weekend, I put on my worker gloves and scaled down to ground. The trail apparently hugs the road and then shoots off along the ridge of the mountain. </p><p>When there's no clear indication of a trail and you're cutting through brush, it's hard to tell if you're going the right way. I naturally followed the downward slope of the mountain, but then remembered this was not the way. I climbed up a bit, using the plants as handles and found a flattened spot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As I headed in the direction that seemed correct, I noticed a red flag on a tree. Okay, I am actually going the right way.</p><p>Most of the trail was completely covered in brush, but there were the occasional stone and cement bricks along the path. The trail did hug the road for a little bit before heading off in the direction of the mountain ridge.</p><p>And after 10 or 15 minutes, the ruins poked through the brush in front of me.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside the ruins was a large painted board that detailed the history of Hosoo Pass and the Post Office. I transcribed the board and put a translation <a href="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information">on this page</a>.</p><p>When the Taira Post Office was established in Shimonashi in 1872 (Meiji 5), the Postal Corps <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span> was also established. The Postal Corps was a group of people who lived in the villages of Taira and Shimonashi. This group of people would gather all the mail for the day and physically hike up to Hosoo Pass and down to Johana. They would collect the mail at Johana, and then return to Taira Post Office. Each person carried a maximum of 18 kilograms of mail and packages. </p><p>They did this 20 kilometer round trip every day, even in winter. When the traveled the formed a line of people. Sometimes in winter, blizzards would be so strong that it was difficult for the mail carriers to see the next person in front of them. They constantly had to sound off to make sure no one was left behind.</p><p>A few years later in 1887, the old Hosoo Pass route opened which made this travel must easier and faster. Again, in 1927 the paved road, Yahata Road, was opened which made travel more convenient in summer, and now mail could be transported by trucks. But the Postal Corps still transported the mail by foot in winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1945, ths Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office was built. Now, the Postal Corps had two teams. Both teams who would leave Taira and Johana post offices at 9am and meet here. Parcels and Mail would be exchanged between both teams. And then, they'd return to their towns. This cut travel time in half, but required more workers.</p><p>In 1955, as Japan experienced significant economic growth, many temporary workers were hired to match the workload. However, by 1971, the villages of Taira, Ueda, and all the areas around Shimonashi experienced significant depopulation. The current members of the corps were aging, and young people moved away to live in larger cities. The postal corps was abolished that year.</p><p>And again, the Nashitani and Gokayama tunnels were completed in 1973 and 1981, which made the road obsolete.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The brickwork and cement structure is still holding after 80 years, but all of the metalwork has rusted, and the roof of the office building has collapsed. Part of the roof still protects the signboard from the weather, though.</p><p>I took a few more pictures and then returned to the road. Out of the entrance to the Postal Exchange, the old route branches up and down the mountain. I wasn't paying close attention, but I managed to go the right way.</p><p>Moving along the ridge of the mountain, I came to the area underneath the paved road. The old route snaked along with the road until it came to that 3-meter drop off with the rope. But, I figured that I could just ascend anywhere that seemed easy enough to reach the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, this looked like a good spot. I grabbed the trees and climbed up. With each step, I grabbed the next bit of plants coming out of the ground. Often I would lose my footing and slip down, but I was able to keep advancing and pulling myself up. Inch by inch, I finally saw the outline of the road and had my exit in front of me.</p><p>I moved along the 3-meter drop off until some plants were high enough to vault me up to a guardrail pipe and then I yanked myself up onto the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I should have shimmied along the road back to the rope, but I was back to civilization, and back on easy street. I returned to my car and continued down towards Johana to meet the Gokayama Tunnel.</p><p>The road continued to snake along the edge of the mountain. Occassionally I would have to squeak my car to the side to let another car pass. Lots of people were using the road today.

A small stream was flowing over part of it, so I thought it was a hydroelectric plant, using the natural spring of the mountain for power. There was an occasional whirring sound, too, which I thought it was a turbine or some kind of internal machinery.</p><p>The northern side of the structure had plastic windows, several of which were broken. I took a look inside, and a car whizzed by! Ah... I checked the map. This was part of the Gokayama tunnel.</p><p>Back at the large square garage-looking door, one of the emergency exits was not locked, and I could go inside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was about a kilometer into the 3km tunnel.

Sakaide was a small family owned restaurant in the center of Shimonashi village.

I don't know how it stood apart from other soba I've had before. In the soba were chunks of cooked bear meat. It also wasn't really remarkable. They tasted like cuts of beef. It was good, but I think buying the mountain vegetable soba <span class='ja'>山菜そば</span> would've probably been better.

It's a pretty short climb, and more seasoned hikers use it as the first stop of a much longer hike going to the peaks bordering Toyama and Ishikawa prefectures. </p><p>A few weeks ago, I planned to explore <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass</a> and the various ruins along that road. The trailhead for Hakamagoshiyama was in the opposite direction after reaching the Hosoo Pass Tunnel. The entirity of the road for Hosoo Pass was paved, but after turning off for the mountain, it was all rock and dirt.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7785_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I stopped a few times to clear some rocks from the road. I also had to move to the side to let a car go through. I guess some other folks just drive over the rocks in the road.</p><p>The trailhead for the hike was clearly marked, but I parked about 100 meters away from the entrance because of a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7792.webp">crack in the road</a>. It was probably safe to drive over, but a few other cars were parked away from the fissure, so I parked back there, too.</p><p>Hiking to the peak of Hakamagoshiyama was pretty rough. Immediately from the start, the path went nearly straight up. This first part of the hike wasn't too bad, as steps were carved and placed into the ground. The trees gave way to a clear sky above and when reaching the top of the stairs, a rest hut was at the top of the first peak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7802_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was pretty early in the hike for a rest, but the hut was meant more for hikers in the winter starting from the villages at the base of the mountains. There is too much snow in the winter to be plowed, so anyone hiking these mountains would spend more than a day doing so.</p><p>Moving further to the edge of this peak, you could see most of the distance someone would have to travel from below.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7820_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was about 300 or 400 meters into the hike so far. There was still another 800 meters to go. This first bit was tough, but the stairs made it pretty easy. The rest of the hike had no stairs and most of the hike was far steeper.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7851_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Sometimes the hike was pull up to a wall of dirt and roots with some ropes attached to trees above. I can usually pull up steep ascents on hikes by myself, but these were far steeper than usual. I actually had to use the ropes. (And the ropes were absolutely necessary going back down.)</p><p>The trail went straight up in parts, and then snaked around some small ridges of the mountain. Occassionally, the trees would open up giving <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7854_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7854_stitch.webp">a beautiful view</a> of all the mountains to the east along with a reminder of how far you've gone.</p><p>It felt like the hike took a while. But, in reality, it only took about 30 minutes from the rest hut to reach the peak. The peak forked into two separate observation points.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7891_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Turning left at the fork and going south, you could see everything to the southwest of Hakamagoshiyama. There was the highway exit for Suganuma Gokayama Village, the exit I initially took to get here. Above the village, the highest peak was Hakusan <span class='ja'>白山</span>, which bordered Gifu and Fukui prefectures. Closer to me were the mountains Ogasa <span class='ja'>大笠</span> and Oizuru <span class='ja'>笈ヶ岳</span>. Mt. Oizuru was the border of three prefectures: Gifu, Fukui, and Toyama. </p><p>The observation point had a lot of bees and large flies buzzing around. Apparently two weeks ago, all of the magenta flowers on the mountain were in full bloom. The insects could have been flying around trying to find any remaining ones still open.</p><p>I took my photos and moved to the northern observation point.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7973_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After climbing the ladder to the top of the tower, you had a full 360-degree view of the surrounding mountains. You couldn't see Gokayama anymore, but all the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7957.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7957.webp">mountains to the south</a> were visible. You could also see all <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7930_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7930_stitch.webp">mountains further to the east,</a> too. Mt. Norikura wasn't in view, but I could see Shirakimine, which I hiked <a href="/old/v7/shirakimine" title="/shirakimine">2 years ago</a>.</p><p>As I approached the observation tower, someone else was already at the top. A woman who was more than happy to talk to me. I was surprised that I hadn't met anyone yet considering the two other cars at the trailhead. Apparently, for seasoned hikers, Hakamagoshiyama is just the first stop on the hike of these mountains. Past the observation tower, you continue down the opposite side of the mountain and go up the western mountains to eventually arrive at the peak of Mt. Ogasa <span class='ja'>大笠</span>. That was too much for what I had planned for today.</p><p>The mountain views were great, but the view to the south was pretty special.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7939_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The whole Nanto, Tonami, and Takaoka areas were visible. It wasn't too hot, but the humidity did limit some of the visibility. Apparently, you could also see over the western mountains and view Kanazawa, but I didn't notice it. Maybe I'll come back some day and continue along the western mountain ridges to see that view.</p><p>I snapped my photos and moved on. There was more adventure scheduled for today.</p><p>Descending mountains is usually the easiest part of the hike, but that wasn't the case when the paths are so steep. I had to constantly hold on to ropes and branches to catch myself from slipping, and I often still slipped anyways.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_8002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Halfway down, I had some kind of cracking sound and then some guys shouting something. I stopped to listen, but the noise stopped. A few minutes later, I heard it again, but had no idea what it was. I reached an observation point and noticed <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hakamagoshiyama/IMG_7996.webp">a few more cars next to mine</a>.</p><p>Further down the mountain, I heard some more shouting. Eventually, I got close enough to it to understand the situation. In the brush, away from the trail and invisible to me, were two guys cutting through a separate trail. They were yelling out to each other as a safety measure. If one of them yelled out and there wasn't a reply, they would know the other person was in danger.</p><p>A worker van was parked at the beginning of the trail, so they must've been construction workers making their way to an electrical tower, or something.

Much like many mountain villages in central Japan, it suffered severe depopulation after the war and eventually ceased to exist. On December 12th, 2011, the final residents left their homes leaving the village completely abandoned. </p><p>A few years prior in October 2009, a monument was erected detailing a brief history of the village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9190.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9190_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9190_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9190_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It also lists the rise and decline of its population by years.</p><p>1730 - 10 houses<br/>1863 - 13 houses<br/>1874 - 15 houses<br/>1940 - 22 houses - 186 people<br/>1975 - 11 houses - 45 people<br/>2008 - 4 houses - 5 people<br/>That winter, the shrine's priest left.</p><p>Seems like 1940 was peak times for the village, and there's a map on the back of the monument listing each of the 22 homes and the leader of the household.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9173.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9173_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9173_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9173_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument was built in the center of the village near the site of the old branch school. The monument titles the school as Hora Branch School with the kanji <span class='ja'>洞分教場</span>. I think this was its original name when it opened in 1900. It was later closed in 1968 as <span class='ja'>坂下小学校洞分校</span>, Sakashita ES Hora Branch School. The monument mentions that throughout its 67 years, it produced only 205 graduates.</p><p>Up the hill beside the open area was a Hakusan Shrine. The gate and the statues further up were covered in tarps to preserve them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9241_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Many of the homes throughout the strip of village were demolished, or had collapsed and were cleaned up later. Down the road, I stopped at some rubble. The roof and walls had been cleared away from the site, but the wooden foundation still remained as did the cement and cerarmic kitchen and bath.</p><p>I was absolutely stunned at how small this bathtub was. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9386.webp">Look at its size compared to my shoe</a>! I think my bathtub now is pretty small, but I can easily fit into despite being 6-feet tall. This tub is less than half that size.</p><p>Also, an interesting thought. Why was the tub empty? If this rubble was exposed to nature for so long, wouldn't rain water fill the tub? The piping must've still been clear.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9371.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9371_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9371_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9371_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Further down the road, at the end of the village, the road went over the river and back down the mountain to the main highway. But it splittered first and led to a huge building. I thought it was a restaurant or a communal inn for people passing through. The door was open, so I went inside and looked around.</p><p>Looking at the map from before, I think this was a home and it belonged to <span class='ja'>西之腰尚</span> Nishinokoshi Takashi? in 1940.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9462.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9462.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9462_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9462_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hora/IMG_9462_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were some recent signs of movement. There was a notice from the electric company from 2 years ago, saying they were coming to the home to replace some wiring. Really, though, the electricity should be completely disconnected. There was also a notice on the bathroom from 3 years ago, saying it had been removed and demolished, so do not enter. (I didn't go inside.)</p><p>Anyways, I didn't stick around for too long. Despite the village being abandoned, the <a href="/old/v7/ikegaharashitsugen" title="/ikegaharashitsugen">Ikegahara Marsh</a> was just up the road, so the route was occasionally traveled.</p><p>Yet another pocket of Japanese history and civilization in the deep dense forest mountains. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Momosegawa Branch School 百瀬川分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/momosegawa-branch-school">Momosegawa Branch School 百瀬川分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It is one of the center most buildings in the neighborhood, and it is very prominent along the neighborhood's main road. It's turquoise color makes it very distinct among the other branch schools in Toga Valley, which are the standard slate gray of concrete.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8757.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8757.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8757_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8757_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8757_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Toga Valley follows Toga River from where it joins Sho River at the base and continues over 40km up the mountains to its source. The overall area had historically been very poor for farming because of its deep forests and rocky cliffs. </p><p>Momosegawa was different. It is about 1km away from Toga Village at the center of the valley, but it's not along Toga River. You must travel over the mountain to the east. When early settlers did this, they found a long stretch of plains with fertile land perfect for farming. Most of Toga Valley's rice production came from this area.</p><p>Naturally people lived here, and naturally their kids needed a school. They couldn't be expected to force their little kids up and over the mountain every day, so a branch school was constructed sometime in the 20s and 30s. I don't have the exact date.</p><p>In the beginning, it was a wooden building built on the northern end of the neighborhood. Then in 1971, construction for the current turquoise building was complete, and the school was opened. It continued in operation until 1989, the first year of Heisei. Then it was officially fully closed in 1996 with all the other extra schools in Toga.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1599_t.webp" /></a></p><p><i>Slight Update:</i> I ended up visiting this area 4 times total over summer. On the second time, I took photos of the above home which is all that remains of the original wooden building of Momosegawa Branch School. Looking through Google Maps Street View history, it seemed like every couple of years more and more of the original building had been torn away.</p><p>This year or last year, it looks like the right side of the home was removed. Two years before that, the left side of the home was torn down. After the building was decommissioned in 71, it was sold to a local sake brewery which used the building for brewing sake and storing its larger barrels. I'm curious how much longer the rest of the home will last.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1609.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1609.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1609_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1609_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1609_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going past the old wooden school up the road brought me to a crazy looking home that had been gutted by structural collapse. The front and side frames of the building were intact, but the roof and back of the home had collapsed leaving only the front outer walls.</p><p>Further up the road was <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1642.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_1642.webp">another home</a> whose front door was in the middle of collapse. The rest of the house looked okay from the outside. Only the front was crushed. The seams had burst so you could look inside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8763.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8763_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8763_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8763_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The door of the concrete branch school was open, so I let myself inside. This was after visiting <a href="/old/v7/kitamamedani-branch-school" title="/kitamamedani-branch-school">Kitamamedani Branch School</a>, which had a very similar layout so I knew where I wanted to go. I went to the gym, which was much smaller than Kitamamedani's gym. Momo's gym had not been renovated or altered since the 70s. It still had its original floor, which had crumbled in most areas. </p><p>In the corner, old gym equipment had been piled up out of the way for the kiln that was set in the middle. There were old ping pong tables, a long rope for tug-of-war, and a taiko drum.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8779_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8779_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8779_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8779_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8779_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Next to the entrance was a stage that doubled as a music classroom. The floor was sturdy, but had completely disintegrated from lack of upkeep. Maybe there was a huge termite infestation that weaken the wood. The windows of the room had been shattered open. There was <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8822.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8822.webp">a certificate</a> on the ground from October 1971 that congratulated the community on the completion of the building.</p><p>From the music room, I moved into the main building. The ground floor had a bathroom, bathing room, kitchen, and office. The office looked different from the rooms of the rest of the building, so maybe it was painted and remodeled after its decommission in 1996.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8830_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8830_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8830_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8830_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8830_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Moving to the second floor, there were more bathrooms, a lunch room, a discussion room <span class='ja'>相談室</span>, and 1st year homeroom <span class='ja'>一学組</span>. In total, Momosegawa only had 3 classes by the time it was closed in 1989. While it was the 1st year homeroom, this homeroom had both 1st grade and 2nd grade combined.</p><p>The classroom had hiragana flashcards on the wall next to the chalkboard. The curtains had been burned thin and weak from over 30 years of sun and neglect. On the wall, there was a calendar from 1998. I found another calendar from 1999 in another room, so it seems like it was only used for another 3 years after the school got rid of it.</p><p>Next to the homeroom was the teacher's living quarters. The whole reason branch schools existed was to offer remote villages ease of education when distances were too great or too difficult to go to the main school. Teachers couldn't be expected to make the daily trips either, so they lived in the school, and had a slight bump in salary to compensate. Momo was a <b>Grade 2</b> remote school out of a max of 5.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8955.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8955.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8955_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8955_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_momosegawa/IMG_8955_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Moving to the top floor, we have the second <span class='ja'>二学組</span> and third year <span class='ja'>三学組</span> homerooms. There was another living room for a teacher, a science room, and a store room.</p><p>The third year homeroom still had newsletters tacked on the wall from Toga Elementary. The listed out the lunch menu for March, the list of events in March, other information about Toga Junior High sports, and other interesting new and information for students. It was pretty incredible seeing all this information still intact.

On one hand, it's a shame that what was once the pride of Momosegawa was now gone. But on the other hand, it was a huge health hazard for the people living next to the building, and especially the old folks home that shared the parking lot. If the building was left to rot and eventually collapse on its own, it would have been an even bigger problem.</p><p>I hope Toga historians were able to make a final sweep of the place and gather any final items of importance.

Although, I'm not so glad that I exposed myself to all that asbestos. When I go into buildings, I always wear a mask. When I get home, I always throw those clothes in the laundry and take a shower/bath, too. I'm not sure what asbestos poisoning feels like, but I was totally fine after, so I think I took adequate precautions.</p><p>While I was inside, I took many photos, so people are able to see what it was like before the very end.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kitamamedani Branch School 北豆谷分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kitamamedani-branch-school">Kitamamedani Branch School 北豆谷分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The full name was Toga Elementary School Kitamamedani Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校北豆谷分校</span>. I'm not completely sure about its history, but I think it may have opened in 1930 as Oshiba Winter Branch School or at the same time.</p><p>Originally, the branch school was built between Kitamamedani neighborhood and the remnants of the now <a href="/old/v7/abandoned-oshiba-settlement" title="/abandoned-oshiba-settlement">abandoned settlement of Oshiba</a>. That building also still stands today and it's been remodeled as a guest house (bed & breakfast). In the late 1950s or 60s, a new concrete building was built in the center of Kitamamedani neighborhood, and that is the prominent building.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8446_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It has such a weird space-age design with its spherical windows in the stairwell. As a school, it continued to operate until 1968 when it was closed. After that, it was used as a community center. The gymnasium was remodeled as a meeting/banquet hall lined with Tatami mats. On the wall were a string of awards with the last one dated 2003. </p><p>The whole hall looked beautiful if it wasn't for the piles of bat feces on the ground. I found a newspaper dated 2015, so maybe that was the last time it was used for anything.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8525.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_8525_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While the main entrance had been boarded shut, the doors to the gymnasium were open. The gymnasium hall led into the main building, which had a kitchen, bathrooms, and a few office rooms. Moving to the second and third floors were rooms that were used as classrooms, but had been converted to an apartment. </p><p>It seems pretty weird, but many of these old schools had people living in them after they closed. They were probably pretty cheap and affordable for people. Also, they were probably really warm and stable in winter compared with wooden homes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_1707_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_1707_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_1707_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_1707_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_kitamamedani/IMG_1707_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p><i>Update:</i> I visited the school again a few weeks later, and there was temporary housing set up on the school grounds. A nearby car was marked as Toga Dam, so I guess the dam needs extra manpower in summer for some reason. Looking through Google Maps, there was also temporary housing set up in 2023 and 2021, so maybe this is routine for the dam and other construction projects in the area.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It apparently closed in 1972, but it was never torn down. The building has stayed abandoned since then, and the local farmers even repurposed it for storage of their farming equipment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now, nature has completely reclaimed the wooden building with trees and vines choking the remains of the structure. The front of the building is surrounded with tall grass, difficult to move through. The entrance to the school is completely shut from vines. The back of the building has tall trees towering over it. Bamboo trees also surround the old school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From certain angles, it's hard to tell there's even a building back there. Apparently later on in summer, the plants grow so high that you can't even reach it. Right now it's only the beginning of June, and already it's a bit difficult getting to the actual building.</p><p>It's a lot easier to move around the back of the building. The tree canopy prevents any of the grass growing. But, the back reveals that the building is in much worse shape.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The south end of the roof has collapsed, probably from the weight of winter snow. As the roof collapsed, it took the second floor, staircase, and back wall with it. Much of the electrical wiring of the building is now exposed.</p><p>Looking at the wood work around the building, it seemed like the local farmers adding a bunch of bracing and other wooden beams to keep the building together. But, a lot of the wood looks like it's been chewed through by termites. Even though the nearby fields look like someone has still been using them, no one has seemed to touch this building recently at all.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school building looks like it had 4 rooms. The main room in the above photo was probably the office. The room leading off to the right was mostly likely the classroom. Then, there was a store room to right in the photo above, about the size of a closet. And lastly, a staircase that went up to another room. I don't know what they would've used that for.</p><p>According to folks on the Internet, the building finished construction in 1957, and in 1959, it serviced only 8 students, the children of the people living in this small farming plateau. 10 years later in 1969, there were only 4 students. It apparently closed in 1972.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going back to the full title of this building, it's the Former Higashinakae Elementary - Sugio Branch - Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>旧東中江小学校杉尾分校渡原冬季分校</span>.</p><p>In 1999, Higashinakae Elementary School <span class='ja'>平村立東中江小学校</span> merged with nearby school Shimonashi Elementary School <span class='ja'>下梨小学校</span>. Both schools were part of Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> at the time, and the new school was named Taira Elementary School <span class='ja'>平小学校</span>. This school used the Shimonashi ES building, so the Higashinakae building was no longer used.</p><p>Side tangent, but in 2004, due to depopulation, Toyama (and many other prefectures at the time) restructured many of its outlying villages and municipalities into larger cities. Taira village joined the other south western villages together into Nanto City. In 2006, Taira Elementary was closed, but the building is still used every day as the administrative building for the residents. It also has the post office, a clinic, and a few stores, too.</p><p>Anyways, back in the day, many of the schools (especially elementary schools) in remote areas had branch schools. Branch schools were mainly used in winter when traveling was difficult. It was much easier for a teacher or two to travel and stay there for a week, rather than the students of the area traveling to the main school building every day.</p><p>The Sugio Branch School <span class='ja'>杉尾分校</span> was in the Sugio neighborhood area further north down the river. The Donohara neighborhood was between Sugio and Higashinakae, and apparently it was too far for those 8 students to go to either school, so the Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>渡原冬季分校</span> was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The tiny area of Donohara is a plataeu above the main road going along the river down to the main Nanto City. Getting to this small area isn't too bad with my Kei car, but I'm not quite sure how a 1950s bus could safely get up here. Maybe they used a smaller bus to navigate the narrow winding road? Or maybe the students just met the bus at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>The narrow road leading to Donohara overlooks the Owatari Bridge <span class='ja'>大渡橋</span>, which was opened in 1958, only a year after the Winter Branch School was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Obviously in summer it's pretty easy to move around, but in winter, I imagine they probably don't even plow this narrow road.</p><p>Looking through photos from just a few years ago, I think the damage to the school building is very recent. Maybe it happened this winter? I wonder how much longer until they completely remove the building. Although, it's remote enough that it'll probably stay until it becomes an actual hazard, or someone buys the land.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/2025-6">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
