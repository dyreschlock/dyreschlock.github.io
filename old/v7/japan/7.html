| February 3, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I came across some interesting Hida history today when talking with my school's librarian.  This year is the 140th anniversary of the formation of Gifu-ken, which happened in August 1876 or Meiji <span class='ja'>明治</span>９<span class='ja'>年</span> as part of the Meiji restoration.</p><p>Prior to the Meiji restoration, Japan was a collection of hundreds of kingdoms.  At that time, Hida was its own kingdom <span class='ja'>飛騨国</span>.  In 1868 (Keioi <span class='ja'>慶応</span>４<span class='ja'>年</span>), the Hida Kingdom was renamed to Hida-ken <span class='ja'>飛騨県</span>.  Though, it didn't last long.  It was Hida-ken in May, and then 1 month later it was renamed to Takayama-ken <span class='ja'>高山県</span>.  From 1868 to 1871 (<span class='ja'>明治</span>４<span class='ja'>年</span>), Takayama was its own prefecture! :D  </p><p>Only 3 years, though.  In 1871, it was absorbed by nearby Nagano territories to form Chikuma-ken <span class='ja'>筑摩県</span>.  Chikuma-ken was basically a gigantic, bloated Nagano.  In August 1876, Hida (and Nakatsugawa) broke away from Chikuma-ken, and joined together with the rest of Mino <span class='ja'>美濃</span> to create what we know of today as Gifu-ken <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span>.</p><p>And then in 1880, the first official map of Gifu-ken was published.  Apparently that map is still available to see today in the Gifu Prefectural Library.</p><p><br/>Anyway, I thought that was interesting.  Also, it's really weird to think that despite of all the ancient history in Japan, Wisconsin (1848) is actually older than Gifu-ken (1876), on paper anyways.</p><p><a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%B1%E7%9C%8C" title="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%B1%E7%9C%8C">https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%AB%98%E5%B1%B1%E7%9C%8C</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Micro-aggressions in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/micro-aggressions-in-japan">Micro-aggressions in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 28, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year, at our second Skills Development Conference, I gave a quick speech about micro-aggressions.  I quickly talked about what they are, what's the problem, and how I deal with them.  I tried to give the topic justice as 2 years prior another ALT gave a similar talk about it, too, and I found it really helpful when dealing with some of the problems of daily life in Japan.</p><p>This was part of a session of "micro-panels" which is consisted of 4 shorter talks about various subjects.  Subjects not necessarily long enough or useful enough to take over their own 50 minute panel.  I budgeted this talk at 10-12 minutes.</p><p>I had some help with this presentation, too.  Fellow ALT and RPA Cathy Anatra volunteered for this subject, too.  Though, I pretty much took over the whole thing, and talked about the things I wanted to talk about.  She helped me QA the speech, and gave me some direction and pointers if I was missing anything.  She also gave some of her own personal experiences during that part of the talk.</p><p>But!  Here's what I wrote.  This is my intended transcript for my talk.  I also included most slides from my powerpoint, and the time-stamps from when I timed myself speaking.</p><div class='title'><b>Micro-aggressions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide01.webp" /></p><p>The term "micro-aggressions" carries some baggage with it for those who have heard it before.  This is the definition I use:  A micro aggression is an everyday slight, indignity, or invalidation unintentionally made towards a marginalized group by a well-intentioned person of the majority.  In the case of Japan, the marginalized group would be us.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide03.webp" /></p><p>These actions may seem small, and not even a problem, but day after day, they add up into something greater.  They not only make us feel different, but they point out how different we are to the society we are living in.  They point out that we don't fit in, and possibly that we won't fit in.  We're not the same, and we're outside of their circle.</p><p>I'm not talking about directly racist or insulting things, though.  I should really underline the terms "unintentionally" and "well-intentioned" in my definition because these are the comments I wish to focus on.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide05.webp" /></p><p>I think the top 3 comments I've gotten over the years have been, "<span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>！", "<span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>？", and "<span class='ja'>何とか休みは帰りますか</span>？".  (or) "You're Japanese is so good!", "Can you eat natto?", and "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?"  Or even..  "where will you travel?"</p><p>We've all heard these haven't we?  <span class='ja'>日本語上手</span>?  Really?  I've said 2 poorly constructed sentences, and my Japanese is good?  <span class='ja'>なっとを食べれる</span>?  Yes, I can eat natto.  Do you think it's poisonous to me, or something?  Am I too inferior to eat it?  <span class='ja'>帰りますか</span>?  Will I return?  Are you asking because I need to go back to "my people."  Because I don't belong here?  Because I'm an outsider?</p><p>Here are some more examples:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide06.webp" /></p><p>These are the kind of micro-aggressions we all get a daily basis.  The first couple of times, it's no big deal, really.  But after months and years, they get tiring and their indirect messages become the real conversation. <br> [2.5 minutes]</p><p>Going back to my definition, this is not intentional.  The person talking to you is unaware of the underlying message being communicated.  They don't "mean" to make us feel alienated, or unwanted with these comments.  And this is why it's difficult to confront the "aggressor" about it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide07.webp" /></p><p>If you confront the other person, and respond to their comments or questions in the same vain as I had just now, you can guarantee they won't make the mistake of talking to you again.  You've basically alienated yourself.  If you want to go more extreme with this example, perhaps you've now made this person think all westerners are confrontational about the smallest of comments or questions.</p><p>However, if you go the other way, by ignoring or shrugging off the comments, you're letting the problem persist.  And you've allowed yourself to soak up more of these comments.  They build and build, and eventually you revile and hate Japan.  If you want to go extreme again, perhaps you'll become a steaming pile of hate whom can never smile, and then no one will talk to you.  You've eventually leave Japan, and tell everyone how terrible a country it is.</p><p>In both instances, you've alienated yourself, and even created or perpetuated stereotypes.</p><p>So..  what's the solution?  You are.  We are.  I think we are the solution.  <br>[1.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide08.webp" /></p><p>For me, I hadn't heard of this term before coming to Japan.  I first learned about it at our SDC two years ago.  I was at a point where after making friends with some teachers and parents, they made a couple of comments that pushed me back, and made me feel distant.  They made me feel like I didn't belong and wouldn't ever belong.</p><p>One of the things that turned me around was learning that this word even existed.  It gave me comfort, and it gave me strength.  This is the reason why I wanted to give this talk, and inform everyone about this word.  Knowing about this word allowed me contextualize the comments that were being made, rather than see them as direct assaults against me.  And through that I was able to deal with them appropriately.</p><p>As an example, at an enkai, one of my teachers kept talking to me in a baby voice.  I think we were talking about hiking and mountain climbing, and she kept responding very deliberately and emphatically.  It really felt like she was talking down to me.  <span class='ja'>そうですね。すごいですね。</span>Patronizing.  <span class='ja'>何とか山をのびますか。</span>As if she had to speak this way in order for me to understand.  </p><p>Even though it annoyed me, I just ignored it, and continued with the conversation.  A few minutes later, she began talking with another teacher, and she had the exact same tone.  And she continued that way throughout the rest of the night.  So it wasn't that she was talking down to me, or anything.  That's just the way she talks. <br>[2 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide09.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, my solution is not to confront, nor ignore, but to respond in a way that creates a conversation.  I think that's one of the most important responsibilities for us in Japan.  We should live up to our titles as unofficial cultural ambassadors.  We shouldn't directly confront their stereotypes about us, but we should bring them up from time and time, talk about them, and inform the other person about you as a person, rather than you as a race.</p><p>Going back to the natto conversation, I just respond with the truth.  Eh… it's okay.  Nothing special.  Do you like natto?  How often do you eat natto?  What food do you like or hate?  I try to pull them into the conversation, rather than it being one-sided.</p><p>Going back to the questions, "Over the next break, will you go back to your country?" or "..will you travel?"  I really see this more as an icebreaker for small talk.  While you could take it as them thinking your life in Japan is just a temporary home, I think a lot of them want to live vicariously through you.  They would love to have your "freedom" to travel around Japan, or the world.  They want to know more about these places, and how it related to their own lives.  And they want to know more about your home country, too.</p><p>This was even true at my previous job back in the US.  One of my co-workers' spouses said that she loved reading my blog, and looking through all the pictures I posted online from visiting Japan.  She liked to live vicariously through me because they don't really travel outside of the country that much.</p><p>Both these questions aren't assaults against you because you're different.  A lot of the time, many of those examples from earlier are just icebreakers.  Other people want to talk to you, and get your opinions on things that may be different for you.  It turns into an opportunity for you to inform and educate others about those differences.  It's usually a great topic of conversation.</p><p>Going back to the baby speech, sometimes if they talk to you like a baby, it could be that they just aren't aware of the amount of Japanese you understand, or perhaps they just don't know how to properly communicate with a foreigner.  Talking with them more often, and finding shared interests will give them more exposure to yourself, and to foreigners in general.  And make them more comfortable talking to us.</p><p>Overall, I would say to put yourselves in their shoes.  Think about where they're coming from when making some of these comments.  <br>[3.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide10.webp" /></p><p>Lastly, I think it's important to understand that we can be just as guilty as making micro-aggressive comments or actions as they are.  It's important for us as we attempt to defuse micro-aggressions directed towards us, that we in-turn, identify and defuse any that we make ourselves.</p><p>I think the two most common ones for me are finding legitimate ways of complimenting or correcting other people's language, and finding ways of talking to Japanese people in English that doesn't sound like Tarzan-speech, or baby speech.</p><p>After receiving so many ill-gotten compliments on my Japanese, I never compliment anyone on how well they speak English because I'm too afraid of sounding like they do to me.  Though, I have a few teachers that have gotten A LOT better at English since I first met them that probably deserve some kind of compliment or reassurance because of how hard they've tried to get better.  I would say that if you were to compliment someone on their English, don't make a single one-off compliment.  Tell them why you think it's good, and why you felt you had to compliment them.  By giving them the reasons for the comments, it becomes sincere and worthwhile.</p><p>As far as talking like a baby, or talking like Tarzan, I think it's very important for us to speak as grammatically and emphatically correct as possible when using English around Japanese people.  Adults can definitely tell when they're being talked down to.  But for our students, we are the "perfect" model for them to learn correct English.  They listen to us way more than you might realize.  They have a keen ear for inflection, emphasis, and intonation.  If you're "dumbing down" your speech to be more understandable, some of those traits could be accidentally taught to them.</p><p>I have an example of this.  Sometimes when talking slow, I add unnecessary emphasis on some of my words.  Especially, the word "and."  One of my students did the speech contest last year.  I helped him write the English for his speech, and I recorded myself reading his speech, so he could practice it over and over again at home.  I used "and" as a conjunction between two sentences, like so, "So, I think one reason manga is so popular is the choice for readers.  And, I think it's fun to cosplay characters that appear in manga."</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide11.webp" /></p><p>When speaking at normal speed, the "and" works as intended.  It's a soft conjunction joining the two sentences.  But, when I slow down, the "and" becomes much more pronounced.  It no longer sounds natural or correct if spoken at normal speed.</p><p>From that point on, whenever we read something in class that uses "and" as a conjunction, this student always has that extra unnecessary inflection.  Weirdly enough, my JTE has started doing it, too.</p><p>Again, this example isn't really a micro-aggression in of itself, but an example that your "model" of English, if thought correct, will be imitated.  Please keep it in mind.  <br>[4.5 minutes]</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/micro_aggressions/Slide12.webp" /></p><p>Anyway, that's my speech, and that's my advice to you.  Thank you. :D</p><div class='title'><b>Finished</b></div><p>I don't think my talk had the same impact of when I first heard about micro-aggressions, but hopefully it inspired some of the audience members to think about things.</p><p>As mentioned before, this was part of a collection of micro-panels at our Skills Development Conference in January.  I was the MC for the entire panel, too, so I wrote an additional 3 minute speech to fill time at the end, if needed.</p><p>Later this year, I'll give this speech at our farewell enkai for those ALTs leaving the program.  It combines two things I've come across talking about foreigners or "outsiders" fitting into Japan.</p><p>Enjoy! :D</p><div class='title'><b>Fitting in Japan</b></div><p>I have another story about living in Japan, or abroad in general.  We are all circle people.  We lived in our circle country, spoke our circle language, and hung out with our circle friends.  We fit in.  Our circle pegs fit perfectly well into the circle holes of our lives.</p><p>But now we're in a triangle country.  Our circle pegs don't fit into the triangle holes.  Being here changes us.  We make many conscious and unconscious decisions on a daily basis that changes our circle shape to more closely resemble a triangle.  We lose some things, and gain some things.  The longer we stay, the more and more we become a triangle.  Though, obviously we can never fully be a triangle, but we can make ourselves fit in.</p><p>As we return to our circle country, we won't fit in at first.  As time goes on, our circle shape will return, but we'll never be as round as we once were.  The story finishes by saying we've become a shape that doesn't necessarily fit into either country.</p><p><br/>One of my students once wrote a speech on what it was like being half Japanese, and half American living in Japan.  Because she felt like she didn't fit in Japanese society, she always considered herself half Japanese.  She finally had the chance to visit the US, and while she physically felt like she fit in, she couldn't speak English well, and didn't really fit in there either.  She felt half American.  </p><p>She told this to her grandfather, and he gave her the following advice.  He was envious of her position.  He never thought of her as half Japanese, or half American, but BOTH Japanese and American.  He never saw her as half-anything.  She is a double.  That really changed the view she had on her own life.</p><p><br/>The experiences that we have in Japan, and the changes that happen to us, stay with us well after we leave.  They ultimately shape us into the people we will become, or into the people that we are.  While perhaps we think we're losing some of ourselves to fit in, we are gaining so much in the process.  And we eventually become part of both societies.<br>[3 minutes]<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to El Niño" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/el-nino">El Niño</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Perhaps you've heard some of the teachers complaining about how weirdly warm it's been so far this "winter". Even last year was a bit warm, too. There's a good reason for that… El Niño.</p><p>Those who come from outside of North America probably either don't know what this is, or have a different name for it. I never really knew what it was growing up in the US either. I just knew about it from that Chris Farley sketch on SNL.<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvmeUStFvz8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvmeUStFvz8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvmeUStFvz8</a></p><p>El Niño is a warm weather pattern that surges in the Pacific Ocean. It typically means that the west coasts of the Americas get a lot of warm and wet weather throughout it's insurgence. On this side of the globe, it makes the Philippines quite dry, and Japan and China quite warm. This is why it's not 10 degrees colder right now.</p><p>Thank you Wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o " title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o ">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o </a></p><p>So yeah, that's interesting or whatever. The real warming is the effect a warm winter has on the trailing summer. It was decently warm last year, too, and we ended up with a hotter than average summer because of it. With an even warmer winter expected this year, it should follow that next year's summer will be even worse than this year. :/</p><p>El Niño might prematurely die off, though, leading to a more normal year. But it seems like "top men" don't think that'll happen. Some even say that this year's El Niño will be the strongest ever recorded.<br/><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/weather/la-me-ln-el-nino-q-a-20151120-story.html" title="http://www.latimes.com/local/weather/la-me-ln-el-nino-q-a-20151120-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/local/weather/la-me-ln-el-nino-q-a-20151120-story.html</a></p><p>Enjoy the mild winter y'all, and pay the price next year.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kendo Ni-dan Test" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kendo-ni-dan-test">Kendo Ni-dan Test</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I am most likely the first foreigner in Takayama to have passed the ni-dan test, and throughout all of Gifu prefecture, I'm probably one or 5 or so to have ever done so.  Though my achievement in the sport is somewhat bitter sweet.</p><p>For some kind of context, perhaps you could consider this a second level black belt if you compared it to Karate.  Though, using the black belt as a metaphor, I think some people consider a black belt as some kind of master level status, but that's not the case.  A first level black belt, or a Shodan grade, means that you've successfully demonstrated that you know and can perform the basics and the core of the martial art.  You've really only mastered the basics, and now the world is open to you.</p><p>Ni-dan is really just a stepping stone.  I wouldn't say that it's a formality, though.  I feel like achieving ni-dan shows that you've successfully demonstrated your capacity and motivation to continue learning and growing in the art.   I don't feel like ni-dan has a true bar of skill for itself.  It's more of a check-in to see whether or not you are continuing correctly.  And that if you continue your path, it's possible for you to attain san-dan, or 3rd dan, in 2 years.</p><p>I think that's the next true step in Kendo.  Shodan is the first step.  With that you've become a true practitioner of Kendo.  But with 3-dan, you've become a professional.  You're an athlete.  It's no longer just enough for me to get the title and become that rank.  I need to build myself.  I need to train.  I need to take exercise and health seriously.  I need to become the ideal of that rank to get that title.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Clear View from Mt.

Because Takayama is literally surrounded by mountains, the weather tends to be isolated. With the warm autumn sunrise, the cold ground creates fog which becomes trapped by the moutains.

The center is located in the high foothills of the Norikura mountain, but it still quite a ways from the top.</p><p>There are quite a few hiking trails around the youth center.  Many of which lead to some small peaks of their own.  After doing a small bit of work, I thought it would be neat to see what the surrounding area had to offer.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" /></a></p><p>The trails led through some deep forest.  The paths were nicely carved out of the forest, so walking and hiking was not difficult.  But any view of distant areas was obscured by the green, green trees.</p><p>Our route was a rather simple loop.  The first leg of the loop went to a peak covered in trees, so we couldn't see anything afar.  The route continued up and down several more peaks still covered in trees.  Up and down, up and down.</p><p>Eventually, the path gave way to some open air.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail met with a rocky path meant for vehicles.  One way led down, and back to some kind of civilization.  The other way the led up our next hill/mountain.  The road was a bit steep, though I'm sure most vehicles would have no problem climbing it.</p><p>We went up the road, and as the road began to level off, we turned around.

The youth center was not that far away.</p><p>Before we returned to Takayama, we drove down to the lodge of the Hida Takayama Ski Slope.  Some people were camping out, but it was mostly empty.  Many ski slopes around the Hida region are pretty much this way during the summer.

It seemed weird that all these places had the same drawings or paintings in roughly the same places.  A few months after arriving, I found the following information posted in Hida-no-sato.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So that's what they are!  These horse paintings are a good luck charm wishing for the safety and well-being of either business or family.</p><p>Then, it wasn't until last year, when I was hiking around <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">Harayama and the Matsukura area</a> that I learned where and how I could get one for myself.  These paintings were made during a festival held on August 9th and 10th in the Matsukura Kannon temple.  During this time, Ema painters and artists stay up for 2 days straight creating these paintings for whomever comes to the temple.</p><p>This festival is called <i>ema-ichi</i> <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span> or the Ema Painting Market.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is where I went.  I've been here twice before.  Once last year, hiking through Harayama for the first time (<a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">Sept 20th, 2014</a>).  And then again during winter (<a href="/old/v7/harayama-in-winter" title="/harayama-in-winter">March 1st, 2015</a>).  The winter was so harsh, that much of the paths through the woods were completely blocked with downed trees.</p><p>5 months prior, this is what the path looked like.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Now, downed trees were either moved out of the way, or cut through to create a traversable path.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much easier.</p><p>Along the path were several hanging signs advertising and announcing the festival.  It didn't take too long before I reached the entrance of the Matsukura Kannon Temple which had hundreds of white signs lining the path.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9929_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9929_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9929_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9929_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9929_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9937.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9937_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was the first afternoon of the festival market.  Not many people were there.  Other than the folks actually putting on the festival, there were only a few attendees there to get paintings, so the line wasn't very long.</p><p>It took me a little while to figure out how to get a painting.  They had order forms on one end of the stage.  You write your name, address, and business, if applicable.  You choose the size, and color of the paintings you want.  And you need to provide a name to be written on the painting.  This name could be of your business, family, or yourself.</p><p>For me, I chose <span class='ja'>慈夢</span>, which can be read as <span class='ja'>ジム</span> or Jim, my name.  This is the kanji I have on my kendo <i>zekken</i> or name plate.  When I started kendo 2 years ago, one of the English teachers thought these kanji were applicable for me.  </p><p><span class='ja'>慈</span>'s <i>on</i> reading is <i>ji</i>, but singularly is <i>itsuku</i>.  It means mercy, or compassion.  <span class='ja'>夢</span>'s <i>on</i> reading is <i>mu</i>, but singular is <i>yume</i> or dream.  So, my kanji name means dream and compassion.  Everyone in Japan who reads my kanji name thinks it's cool and totally applicable.  I guess the compassion part fits, but I'm not really sure about dream.  Lots of Japanese names use that kanji, though, so maybe that's part of it.</p><p>Also, you need to choose which direction the horse should face: left or right.  Going back to that original definition, horse paintings should be directed inside the house.  The idea is that good luck with come into your lives, or into businesses.  But, I took the literal definition and had the horse facing outwards.  The idea being that my work is always done outside of house, and that's where I want my luck to be directed.  Additionally, I chose my kendo name so I would have good luck doing that.  And all of that is done outside of my house.</p><p>Anyway, you fill out the sheet, hand it to the guy, and pay him the cash.  Mine was 1500<span class='ja'>円</span>, I think.  Larger prints are more expensive.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then the painter writes in the date, his signature, and the name you give him.</p><p>I went with a simple painting on Japanese paper facing left.  I think I got the smallest, too.  The other prints were so large.  They wouldn't really fit anywhere in my place.  For colors, you could choose a brown, white, or black horse.  Or you could choose neither color, and go with my option.</p><p>Even though I chose the smallest option, it was still too large for most of the frames available.  Valor Home Center did have a large cheap frame that could hold my Ema painting, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Hurrah, I finally got my very own Hida horse painting.
