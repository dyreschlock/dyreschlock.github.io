The north coast of the pennisula is pretty remote, and traveling there takes about two hours by car from any other notable cities.</p><p>Wajima is Noto Pennisula's largest and most notable city, but traveling to the very end of the pennisula is another hour still. Tons of naturally formed islands and cliffs are along the north coast, and at the end is the <b>Blue Cave</b>.</p><p>When my friend Zach and his friend came to visit, we decided to travel all the way north to this spot to view the many areas of the Noto Pennisula, and the Blue Cave was first on our list.</p><p>Above the cave is an observation deck to get a view of the coastline, and of the ryokan village below. After paying the entrance and putting on a hardhat, you walk down the path heading east to the coastline and into the cave. </p><p>The Cave is okay. It's a cave. You go in, take some pictures, and that's pretty much it. People say that the cave holds the core of the energy of Sanctuary Cape which extends to the rest of the Pennisula. People also find "zen" by stacking rocks found in the cave brought from the ocean. But, there's no long tunnels leading to interesting places. There's just the opening to the ocean, and everything else is closed off.</p><p>Hiking around and walking along the surrounding beaches, finding more rocks to stack and other ocean debris was more interesting.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Timelapse" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-timelapse">Takayama Timelapse</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 22, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The scenery in Takayama is simply gorgeous.  It's hard to really capture everything in photos or videos.  I love living up here in the mountains.</p><p>One peculiar things about living while surrounded by mountains is that we tend to have 2 sunrises and 2 sunsets.  One where the sun crosses the mountains, and the other when it crosses the actual horizon.  It creates an extended dawn and dusk everyday.</p><p>I live at the base of Kitayama, one of the more prominent small mountains in Takayama.  It sits between my apartment and the downtown area of Takayama.  Usually when I go downtown to go to a drinking party, climbing up one side, and back down the other is faster than going around it.</p><p>It's the perfect location to see both sunrise and sunset.</p><div class='title'><b>Sunrise - April 19th, 2016</b></div><p>Looking east from Kitayama paints a perfect image of Mt. Norikura <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span>.  It's not the tallest mountain nearby, but it's easily the most recognizable.  Underneath the mountain is my neighborhood in Takayama, Sanfukuji <span class='ja'>三福寺</span>.</p><p>The weather report was perfect!  100% clear and beautiful.  I woke up before 5am, and went on top of Kitayama.  I set up my camera, and took the following time-lapse from 5:00 to 7:07.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEO5xQkjxvw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>My camera took 1085 photos.  Apparently 5am wasn't early enough, as it was already pretty light out when the time-lapse started.  Oh well, next time!</p><div class='title'><b>Sunset - November 4th, 2014</b></div><p>I took the sunset one just after I began messing with the time-lapse options available to me.  Looking west from Kitayama, you're able to see all of the downtown area of the city.  This time-lapse was from 3:49 to 5:53.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAvqBqwkP_0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>As soon as the sun dropped below the mountains, it turned from warm to cold.  Unfortunately, my camera ran out of batteries before it could get completely dark.</p><div class='title'><b>Equipment</b></div><p>In order to make these time-lapses, I needed 3 additionally things to go with my camera.  I bought a pretty cheap <b>tripod</b> at one of the second-hand stores in Toyama.  It's a bit flimsy, but it's nice, light, and easy to move around with.  I also needed to buy an <b>aperture</b>.  An aperture is a hand-dial you plug into your camera, and you tell it when to take photos.  With these, I can tell my camera to take a photos every 5-7 seconds.</p><p>For my time-lapse, I set the camera in HDR mode to try and capture as much of the scene as possible.  Then, I compiled all the photos together using <b>ffmpeg</b>.  FFmpeg is a command line application that will create a movie file from a sequential set of image files.  It can be a bit difficult to use, but I eventually figured out some decent options.  </p><p><code>ffmpeg -r 24 -i frame%04d.jpg -b:v 15000k -s hd1080 anoutput.mp4</code></p><p>I don't exactly remember what each term means, but it creates a 1080p video file that looks quite nice.  It does squish the image, though, rather than cropping it.  Close enough, though.  Before running this, I wrote a quick program to rename all my photo files to be sequential starting with 0000.</p><p>Here are the starting and finishing images of the compilations.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The beginning and end of a day in the life of Takayama.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hanami in Takayama 花見" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hanami-in-takayama-2016">Hanami in Takayama 花見</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

For the past 3 years, the Sakura trees haves bloomed two weeks later.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7377.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7377.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7377_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7377_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7377_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7384.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7384.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7384_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7384_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7384_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But not this year.  The sakura trees look absolutely gorgeous. :D  And, as I mentioned in this previous post, their shock of white and pink against the dark, black backdrop makes them pop.</p><div class='title'><b>Night Procession</b></div><p>The Takayama has 4 main events throughout its 2 day span.  Perhaps the most attended event is the night procession.  Just after dusk, the 12 or 13 floats are pulled through the downtown area.  The float move through the "old" town, through the main road, and back through shopping area.</p><p>2 years ago, I wrote a fairly lengthy post about the festival, and details about each float.  Check that out here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.</p><p>I got to the festival a little late this year, but I was still able to see everything near the tail end of the route.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Above is the first float, and it seems to be the same float in both spring and fall festivals.  It's <i>kagura-tai</i> <span class='ja'>神楽台</span> or "War Opener".  It's not as tall as the other floats, but it's probably the loudest.  On the top of the float, sits a large drum with drummer on both sides.  Around the front and back are flutists playing the in unison with the other flutists paving the way.  These musicians offer their music to god, and pave the way for the entire parade to follow.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7434.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7434_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7434_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7434_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7450.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7450_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7450_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7450_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next floats in the parade were <i>Sanbasou</i> <span class='ja'>三番叟</span>, <i>Jakkyou-tai</i> <span class='ja'>石橋台</span>, and <i>Ryuujin-tai</i> <span class='ja'>龍神台</span>.  These 3 floats are the ones that perform in the marionette showcase that happens 4 times throughout the 2-day festival.

Oni are physical strong Japanese demons who ravage and destory small villages in ancient Japanese folklore. Only brave warriors can face and defeat them.</p><p>The hill itself was formed from rocks pushed up out of the ground from earthquakes and then tempered by the waves and weather. During the sengoku period, a small castle was built on the top of the hill to easily spot armies using the coastline to travel south.</p><p>With the image of Oni carved into these cliffs, the castle became known as Onigajo <span class='ja'>鬼ヶ城</span> or Oni Castle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Visiting the cliffs is free, and it has plenty of parking. There's a visitor center at the parking lot, which directs people to the path leading to the cliffs.</p><p>The stone from above is pretty clean, like any exposed mountain surface. The stone closer to the sea water is much more fitting of rock eroded by salt and water.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's amazing how soft and brittle the stone looks on its own. But it is literally rock hard, and any sharp peaks of the rock, could easily cut or puncture skin.</p><p>Railings were planted into the rocks to keep people from falling or slipping into the ocean. The path leads through the giant Oni face and further past the other side. Unfortunately, the rest of the 1km path along the coast was closed due to erosion.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The original path leading all the way around the cliffs was ruined and too dangerous to travel. The path was meant to circumnavigate the whole hill. But, I had to turn back.</p><p>Coming back to the visitor center, there was a short hiking path that lead to the top of the hill where the castle once stood. Now, it's an open park with a great view of the surrounding area. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hill is aligned with many cherry blossom trees. I think I was about a week late to see them in full bloom, though. From the top, I had a clear view of the town below, Kumano-Odomari Town.

The local people call it Maburika for some reason, and old folks usually row to it as a good fishing spot.</p><p>The plaque near the visitor center explains the legend of this island. In the late 700s, during the reign of Emperor Kanmu, Shogun Sakaue Tamuramaru was ordered to defeat the demon leader who held Oni Castle at that time. It was a fierce battle. During the battle a small boy on Mamiruga Island was seen dancing and singing songs. This made the demon open the castle door to get a better look. This given the Shogun the opportunity to fire a single arrow at the demon, and kill it instantly.</p><p>The Kanji <span class='ja'>魔見</span> means Demon Looks. <span class='ja'>魔</span> or ma is the kanji for demon, and <span class='ja'>見る</span> is the kanji for look.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Before leaving the area and heading home, I stopped at an overlook on the other side of door given a view of the cliffs, the hill, and the park on top of the hill.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Mar 2025 and back-dated to the time of my visit.</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Myohozan Amida Temple 阿彌陀寺" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/myohozan-amida-temple">Myohozan Amida Temple 阿彌陀寺</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In 2011, when my brother and I came to Japan, we did sight-seeing around the Kansai region of Japan.  I looked into the logistics of being able to visit Taiji, but it was just too far out of the way, and quite expensive by train.  Driving was really the only sensible option.</p><p>Now that I live in Japan, and drive in Japan, I finally took the opportunity to go there.  Taiji is located on the southern end of the Kii peninsula, so the most sensible route will always enter the town from the north.  That's where I found that dolphin bridge from <a href="/old/v7/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama" title="/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama">the previous post</a>.

After the "research" vessel fires enough harpoons into the whale to tire it down, and keep it from fighting, the metal contraption clamps into the whale's tail, and hauls it back from the ocean to land for their meat.</p><p>From here, I started roaming around town a little bit to figure out some locations.  I went passed the whaling museum, and saw the cove.  I continued on and went to the downtown area, found the city hall, and took photos overlooking the area.  I went back to the cove, and took those photos.  Then hiked up the northern surrounding mountain, which gave a nice view of the area.  Though, the cove was not visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After that, I spent some time at the Whale Museum, and then began to explore the southern area of the town.  There are several points along the coastline which housed ancient (and some modern) light houses.  Light house keepers had to stay in the light houses several days to make sure the fire continued to burn and illuminate the coastline, so each lighthouse had a small house or a dorm for the keeper.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The old wooden light houses were no longer there, but some locations still had the dorms.

They did their tricks and got their small treats as rewards.</p><p>After watching <a href="/old/v7/the-cove" title="/the-cove">The Cove</a> all those years ago, I can't stop thinking about the well-being of these dolphins, or really any animal in captivity.  The Cove made mention that dolphins communicate and hear through echo-location and sound.  The subtle reverberations of their pings bouncing off walls and objects in the open water to give them a sense of location.</p><p>In a tank, they're obviously trapped and surrounded by sound.  What's worse is the sound of the announcer from the speakers blaring overhead.  And the crowd clapping and cheering them on.  It can be sensory overload for a dolphin or   a porpoise.  Many captive dolphins commit suicide, or damage themselves by ramming into the sides of their tank to try and make the pain go away.  At least, for ones caught in the wild.</p><p>I think there's some law enacted that states dolphins, orca, and other porpoises can no longer be caught in the wild for the porpoises of captivity because it's so damaging and harmful to them.  Only sea-mammals born and raised in captivity are allowed to be kept in captivity.  </p><p>This is probably directly because of their echo-location senses.  Being born and raised in captivity allows them to live with the noise their entire life, and adapt from the very beginning.  Though, this means they could never be released in the wild.  We've basically split their species on a different evolutionary path, much like dogs and wolves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But, they flip around and jump around, and everyone claps.  I wonder what actually compels these dolphins to obey.  They are just animals, but they're smarter than most.  Smarter than dogs.  I wonder if they have some kind of loyalty gene as well, and since we've had them in captivity long enough, those loyalty genes have been passed on to their offspring, continuing the cycle, breeding a more loyal dolphin.</p><p>At some point, this gets just as perverse as dog breeding.  Though, the real perversion of this place is to come.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Enclosed Bay</b></div><p>Passed the dolphin tanks is an enclosed bay connected to the ocean.

Successfully capturing and killing one of these massive creatures could easily feed the town for months.  Back in the day, whales used to come quite close the coast.  Hundreds of years ago, there were very few large ships patrolling the oceans, and there were all made of wood.  They were no mechanical noises to ward away the creatures of the sea.</p><p>The hunters of the village, would get into smaller boats (models shown above), and extend very large nets between multiple ships.  Once a whale was captured in the nets, and they could get close, the hunters repeatedly stabbed and skewered the beast with their spears.  Eventually wounding it enough, to be pulled onto the beach, and killed.</p><p>Such effort must have taken almost an entire day.  Even when killer whales kill a seal in the open ocean, it takes about 8 hours before they've beaten it enough for it to quit fighting back.  Only once the hunters have destroyed the whales will to live, could they drag it close enough to the beach to finish the job.</p><p>Extended in the middle of the building was a 1:1 scale of the hunters preparing to attack their prey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The area showed some of the more modern equipment used to kill whales, but it was small in comparison to their traditional hunting methods.</p><div class='title'><b>Biology</b></div><p>The middle floor focused on the biology of the sea mammals.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first corner had several internal organs of whales.

In the end, they are able to capture the footage they want, and use the footage against those denying this thing happens.</p><p>I think it's a pretty powerful movie.  I've never quite been able to enjoy zoos or aquariums quite in the same way after seeing this movie.  It exposes the cruel environments many of the animals are held in, and why it's so damaging to them.</p><div class='title'><b>The Name</b></div><p>Why is this called The Cove?

Just some ropes and tarps.</p><p>After that, I basically gave up.  I could've went around to the other sides of trails, but I figured I would continue running into more gates, and turn around.

People just didn't seem friendly at all.  I was taking some photos and saw some junior high students walking by.  I said, "Hello," and got nothing back.  They just looked at me as if I had no business being there.  Shopkeepers were very short with their dialog, too.</p><p>Perhaps thats because the usual foreigners that visit Taiji knew about the city from the film, so the local people assume they're there to do them harm.</p><p>The town just didn't feel right.
