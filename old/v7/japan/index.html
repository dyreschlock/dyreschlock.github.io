| December 23, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Japan is a country full of pockets within its dense urban centers and rural country. Everyone carves out their own small spaces within the narrow alleys and multi-story buildings of the cities, and the dense forests and sharp cliffs of the country. There are so many unique locations and perspectives that so many of them are overlooked and somewhat undiscovered. It can feel magical when you step into one.</p><p>I think the Kudou Teruhi Museum <span class='ja'>工藤耀日美術館</span> is such a location.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span> is an artist and painter born in 1939. Frustrated with the pressures and constructs of Japanese art and society, he sold all his possessions in 1986 and moved to China to discover his own identity. 18 years later, he returned to Japan and purchased the newly closed Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> in the north western mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. He used the school building as his studio and opened the building to the public in 2008 as a museum to host his works. </p><p>Perhaps the most impressive showcase of his art is his massive mural lining the walls of the old junior high gymnasium.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The mural seems to cover a few periods of his life's work: his Women in Waves series inspired by the style of Pablo Picasso, his journey of Han Dynasty art represented by the dragon, and his paintings of Yamataka Jindai Zakura, the 2000-year old Cherry Blossom tree near the city down the mountain. He has been working on this for over 10 years.</p><p>Looking through old photos online, the mural was an evolving and continual effort over the last decade and it should continue to evolve in the future. There was a new piece on the floor in-progress.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The current location of the museum is in Sutama Town Obi District <span class='ja'>須玉町小尾</span> part of Hokuto City <span class='ja'>北杜市</span>. When Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> was built in 1947, the area was Masutomi Village <span class='ja'>増富村</span>. The village would be abolished in 1959. One by one, each of the mountain villages in the area became incorporated into Sudama Town <span class='ja'>須玉町</span> with Masutomi being the final piece. The area was named to Sudama Town Obi. Sudama was later renamed to Sutama in 1990.</p><p>Masutomi Junior High School closed in March 2004 due to further depopulation of the mountain villages. Any remaining students were transported by bus to Sutama Junior High School at the base of the mountain. Later that year in November 2004, governmental mergers combined all northwestern municipalities into a single city, Hokuto City.</p><p>Now, there doesn't really seem to be many people up here. Only the elderly folks who have lived here for over half a millenia remain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When I arrived, I looked around to see if I was in the right place. I saw someone in the window and soon after an elderly man popped out of the main building. This was Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. He came out to greet me. I asked about the museum and he immediately pulled me into the gym to see the mural. He told me about working on the mural for over 10 years and about when he came here.</p><p>Next, he brought me into the main building to see the rest of his work. The entrance way displayed some of his contemporary works, a series of Chinese dragons. The first floor of the old junior high school had an open room (probably a multi-purpose room), the 1st-year homeroom, and 2nd-year homeroom. The open room displayed more murals of his women series. I think they were interchangeable screens used in his gymnasium mural.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next room displayed his original work of his women series. He painted this series in 2005 and had photos of his exhibition of the series in Barcelona. </p><p>He took this time to explain his name. All of these paintings were signed as Kenji Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤賢司</span>, not his actual name, Teruhi Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. For almost all his life, he used Kenji Kudou as a pen name for his work because it sounded much better. Much of his work and life was inspired by Pablo Picasso, and the name Pablo Picasso had a rhyme and rhythm that he absolutely loved. Kenji Kudou had a similar rhythm, so he used it.</p><p>It wasn't until he returned to Japan in his late 60s that he felt he had found his identity and wanted to mark his work as who he was, rather than someone else he was trying to be in his youth. His chapter as Kenji Kudou was complete and he could now be a painter as himself.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next classroom displayed painted murals of Mt. Huangshan in China. While living in China, he hiked these mountains and was inspired as many artists have been in the past. Clouds cover most of the mountains, but when you climb the high peaks, you can see all the mountains in the range poke up from the white below into the sky.</p><p>It's apparently one of the most beautiful scenes in the world. He drew several sketches of the landscapes and painted those scenes at a large scale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, the personalized tour continued with the next room focused on paintings influenced by Han Dynasty history and culture. The painting above is titled "Animals From Han Dynasty."</p><p>In the next room, he had paintings from an assortment of series. He had a series that focused on Shingen Takeda and Yukitaka Sanada, two samurai legends of Yamanashi prefecture. He had a painting of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp">Michael Jackson</a>, and more recent Women paintings which bore his Teruhi signature, not Kenji.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final room was devoted to a series of Sakura paintings. Much like most people, I love the aesthetics of Cherry Blossom trees. The pure white/pink petals blooming at the start of the year, representing youth and new beginnings set in front of the dark blackness of trees that have lived longer than any human and refuse to die.</p><p>This series focuses on Yamataka Jindia Zakura, an ugly gross tree that has lived over 2000 years. Kudou mentioned that the tree was not far away, so I went to visit the tree when I left. It's December, so obviously nothing is in bloom, but you can clearly view the skeleton of this monster tree.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Completing the tour of his museum, he showed me his workspace in the former staff meeting room. And he introduced me to his wife, who was studying Persian in the former staff room. At the front desk, I bought two of his books and paid for entry totalling 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Entry was 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> and each book was 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Expensive, but well worth the personalized tour and supporting this amazing artist. </p><p>I also signed his guestbook. Apparently I had been the only visitor since Wednesday.</p><p>This little space he had created in the world was incredible. However, the brilliance seems only matched by the difficulty of getting there. There are no trains. There are no busses (not really). It's located in an absorbed remote village that probably loses half its remaining population each year.</p><p>While they are many pockets of people in the dense mountain forests, I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Japan.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane-in-2025">Revisiting Takane 高根村 in 2025</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I visited here a few times after I first moved to Takayama, but it has been a while.</p><p>After the municipal mergers of 2005, Takayama City absorbed all of Takane's governemental bodies. Due to the lack of students and general proximity to nearby Asahi village, both Takane Elementary School and Junior High School were closed in 2007. <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">I visited in 2013</a>, and both buildings were still standing. <a href="/old/v7/revisiting-takane" title="/revisiting-takane">I visited again in 2015</a>, and the Junior High had been demolished.</p><p>It's been 10 years since I've driven in this direction on my way to Tokyo. I had a business-related trip this past weekend, so I went through Kiso Pass into Nagano, rather than Hirayu (the usual).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4463_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takane Elementary was still standing. However, a distilling company bought the land and building. They torn down all the trees on the property and erected their building. According to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4481.webp">the nearby construction sign</a>, construction began on November 28th, and should be finished by the end of March. I wonder if they plan on tearing down the old building.</p><p>I really don't understand why they built Takane Elementary School in this location in the first place. There is nothing nearby. It's about 2 kilometers away from the center of the village. It also would have been WAY too dangerous for them to walk along the narrow road, so all students would've had to take a bus to get there. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much closer to the center of the village and across the river is the site where the Junior High School was located. It would've made more sense to put the elementary school here. This is actual walking distance from homes. </p><p>Since the building's demolition in 2014 or 2015, it looks like the whole area has been paved. Nearby, some construction crews were moving dirt. In the summer, temporary housing is probably set up here for people working at the Takane Dam, or working on other construction projects out here in the deep mountains and forest.</p><p>In 2013, it seemed like the junior high school was being used for community classes. But, I guess the community no longer needed that building nor the elementary school. Over the last 12 years, I suppose the small population of Takane village has decreased even further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_takane/IMG_4485_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's really no reason for anyone to go to Takane anymore. Further up the mountain in Takayama's most remote village, Hiwada, Caio Sky Resort closed due to Covid. Many of the mountain onsen have closed, too. There's a roadside stop on the way to Takane, but I doubt they'll be open much longer.</p><p>I don't think any young people live out here anymore. There are only elderly people hanging on to their homes. And, I'm sure most of them probably live with their children closer to town most of the time.  I wonder where the people working at Hida Distillery live.</p><p>Anyways, I'll come back in the Spring and see what else has changed.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wind Castle Shuttered" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered">Wind Castle Shuttered</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

From this vantage point, you could notice anyone coming down the mountain into the city. Likewise from the other direction, you have a full view of Toyama and nearly all its neighborhoods shielded by the surrounding mountains.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4294_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I first visited the Wind Castle <a href="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle" title="https://theschlock.com/wind-castle">2 years ago</a> never even knowing it had been since the 80s or 90s. Although, in reality, it's not really all that easy to see unless you know what you're looking for. The castle tower isn't really that tall and its aluminum shimmer blends into the sky and the trees.</p><p>It's also not all that convenient to get to from Hwy 41 either. You either go further north than is necessary, or you take a narrow windy road straight to it. Once you arrive in Sakurayama Forest Park, it's another 450 steps up the castle trail to the peak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4394_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's a pretty landmark, but it seems like it has been closed for good. Even when visiting 2 years ago, a lot of the paint was chipping away, and molding holding the thick bottled glass tiles was peeling. Now, several of the glass tiles have cracked, broke open, or broke free of their mold. The metal deck also bends under the weight of my steps. It doesn't really feel safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4312_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm not really sure where this extra damage came from. There were some tiles missing before, but everything still seemed safe. Perhaps the New Years earthquake of 2024 knocked a lot more of this stuff loose. There's not a lot of money to go around these days, so the city probably thought it was easier to shutter the attraction, rather than pour money into the necessary renovations.</p><p>Throughout the year, Toyama would illuminate the castle in the evening, and the controls for the illumination were inside the room on the observation deck. The leading doors were locked, but the door on the farther side had been pulled open. The wooden edge of the door has disintergrated, <a href="/old/v7/wind-castle-shuttered" title="/wind-castle-shuttered">pulling itself away from the hinges</a>. Another door had already been boarded shut, probably having suffered the same fate.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251213_wind_castle/IMG_4316_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside was a phone, speaker amplifier, and a bunch of dials and do-dads.

The weather always seems to change a bit in the mountains obscuring them from view.

No one is putting money into any public attractions these days, especially in rural areas. I would imagine most of that money is going into infrastrcture, repairing roads and making new tunnels. I doubt it'll ever be repaired. Also, removing it might be costly, too.</p><p>We shall see.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Himi Showa Hall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/himi-showa-hall">Himi Showa Hall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Last year's theme focused on Kanamori Nagachika and various locations that were impacted by him. This year, the focus was on trees!</p><p>There are several millenia old trees in Takayama, but Takayama also has a rich history in carpentry and craftsmanship in wood arts. After the area was taken over by Kanamori in the late 1500s, he recognized the unique carpentry skills of the residents and cultivated their ability. Many of the resulting woodwork would be used for buildings throughout Gifu, Nagoya, and Kyoto.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0869_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just like last year, the event was hosted at the Takayama City Museum and also just like last year, it was advertised very little. I think the posters at the entrance of the museum were the only indication it was happening. Once again, I didn't hear about it until a local friend sent me a message. Here's the link for information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/">https://photorogaining.com/event/4254/</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0874_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my third photo rogaining event. I joined <a href="/old/v7/takayama-photo-rogaining" title="/takayama-photo-rogaining">last year's Takayama Rogaining event</a> as my first. Prior, I had never heard of this kind of event before. The etymology of Rogaining comes from the three people who coined the term, Roy, Gail, and Neil, and they first began using the term in the 70s. However, Photo Rogaining isn't all that different from Orienteering which dates back to 1897.</p><p>Overall, it's like a marathon, but you create your own path. 20 or 30 minutes prior to the start of the race, runners or teams of runners are given a map and a list of checkpoints. Runners have no knowledge of this leading up to the start.</p><p>Here were the map and list of checkpoints for this year:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gLQAYxRcf9d2PYrUV7JxoWr4m0o77Lsy/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aA9YpYeVgFrp8eTiOeJ0PPCqH3TSxmTC/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-2025-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Each checkpoint has a different point value. For each checkpoint you visit, that point value is added to your total. The team or runner with the highest point value wins. Photo Rogaining goes one step further by requiring runner to take photos of the target at each checkpoint. You are meant to recreate the photos listed on the checkpoint sheet.</p><p>Each Orienteering or Rogaining event has a strict time limit, so you must reach the finish line within the time limit while collecting as many checkpoints as possible. The Takayama Photo Rogaining event has a limit of 3 hours. You are deducted 30 points each minute you are late.</p><div class='title'><b>Bonus Points</b></div><p>As an added bonus (or headache), the Takayama Rogaining event adds some extra bonus points. Last year, you could gain an extra bonus point for every photo you took of Kanamori Nagachika's name written out on a sign for a total of 20 bonus points. I didn't quite understand this last year, so I ignored it. Ultimately I lost 2nd place by 4 points. :/</p><p>This year's bonus points were much more cryptic and numerous.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0880_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Part 1 were the normal <span class='ja'>通常</span> bonus points. At four of the checkpoints (numbers 1, 17, 25, 47), if you took an additional photo matching the ones posted, you could get an extra 5 points each. This was very clear and easy to understand. Find the stuff, and take a photo. Got it!</p><p>Part 2 were the secret <span class='ja'>秘密</span> bonus points. There were 3 different collections of locations that each followed the theme posted on the board. If you went to each of the locations that matched the theme, you would be awarded either 40 or 30 bonus points.</p><p>The three themes were as follows:<br/>Theme 3 - 40 points - 1000<span class='ja'>年の時を見てきた長生きの木</span><br/>Theme 2 - 30 points - 400<span class='ja'>年の時をつなぐ</span>4<span class='ja'>人の飛騨の匠</span><br/>Theme 1 - 30 points - 100<span class='ja'>年の経済を支えた飛騨の大工を支える代表企業</span></p><p>At a glance, I just noticed 1000-year-old trees, 400-year-old takumi, and 100-year-old carpenters. At the time, I thought, Yeah, I could correctly translate these to understand them completely. However, I would have no idea which locations would match these descriptions. So, I choose to not focus on them and hope my path would collect these locations.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_0882_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When the time came, we were able to open our maps and start plotting our courses. Having done these events twice now, I have learned that you want to make big swings towards the distant areas first, and clean up the points near the finish at the end. If you spend too much time getting all the near points at the beginning, you may not have enough time to get the high valued places further out.</p><p>This year's far out locations were nearly the same as last year's. So my plan was to grab a few near checkpoints while heading further west to Hida no Sato and the Shingu neighborhood. From Shingu, head directly north to the Kumano Shrine, which <a href="/old/v7/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter" title="/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter">I visited back in February</a>. And then head back downtown to grab any more points I could before the finish.</p><p>My plan was also to not get any checkpoints that required backtracking unless I had the time for it and they were high value.</p><div class='title'><b>Start!</b></div><p>At Noon, the bell was rung and the museum bay doors were open allowing everyone to spill out into the street and start running in their directions.</p><p>I immediately went to the 3 checkpoints clustered together at Nakabashi. First was point 3, the Sakura tree next to the bridge, <span class='ja'>高山市基準木のサクラ</span>. On the other side of the bridge was point 6, <span class='ja'>木鶴大明神像</span>, the statue of Mokkaku Daimei.

I made the big swing to grab Points 41 and 42, but with so little energy left at the end and not so much time, I did not go the extra distance out of my way to get Points 8 and 9. If I had known these would've boosted my score an extra 30 points, I would've skipped Takayama Station and the Library. This was basically a 34-point loss.</p><p>Points 17, 28, 49 were the 100-year-old companies. This one was a wash anyways. I had only gotten Point 17. I could've done a little backtracking for Point 28 near Hida-no-Sato. But I had never considered going after Point 49. It was too far north. Technically, no real point loss.</p><p>Had I actually done training for the event and had better knowledge of these bonus points, my score could've easily been more than 100 points higher. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1009_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Shimizu got first place again this year by visiting nearly all checkpoints on the map. He only skipped four points. He skipped Point 49, which was too far north, losing him 30 bonus points. He also missed a 5-point bonus photo somewhere.</p><p>The standings were as follows:<br/>1st Place - 768 points<br/>2nd Place - 747 points<br/>3rd Place - 693 points<br/>4th Place - 603 points<br/>5th Place - 557 points<br/>6th Place - 510 points<br/>7th Place - 505 points <--- It's me!<br/>8th Place - 481 points<br/>9th Place - 423 points</p><p>Ultimately, I ended at 7th place out of 9 people in my division. Not Last! Also, our division was the most competitive, so my score was pretty close the top places in the group and family divisions. 100 points would have boosted me to 4th place, but I would have absolutely not made the Top 3 this year.</p><p>They had a lot of extra prizes, so I was able to win something anyways. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251122_taka_rogaining/IMG_1021_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, I love running these Photo Rogaining events, but I always feel disappointed in the end. It's like the opposite feeling after completing a marathon. In both cases, poor training can result in poor times, but for Rogaining, there's always the worry of whether or not you are following the optimal path for your ability.</p><p>Anyways, I was only able to do two Rogaining events this year. I signed up for a third, but it was held only two days after this Takayama event. My legs were ruined the whole weekend, so it was impossible for me to join. I spent the rest of the weekend building that Lego Gameboy. (They sent me a map, though, so I could mentally practice.)</p><p>I'll try to do more next year! Maybe this time I will have the proper motivation to train for them. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Juunigatake in Autum 十二ヶ岳" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/juunigatake-in-autum">Juunigatake in Autum 十二ヶ岳</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

For quite a while, I have wanted to hike the mountain again for some updated photos. I remember it being a really easy hike, so I finally pulled the cord and went back on a beautiful and clear mid-November day.</p><p>The hike was almost exactly the same as it was back when I first arrived in Takayama. Here's <a href="/old/v7/juunigatake" title="/juunigatake">my post from 11 years ago</a>.

Taking a left continued up the mountain, and taking a right continued along the edge of the mountain going to some unknown destination. I wonder if there are any abandoned homes or buildings that way. (Actually, the road probably just ends.)</p><p>I went with left path and ascended reaching a road block after 10 minutes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just a few meters down the road, a landslide had covered some of the path. I probably could have driven around or over it, but the real risk is the current part of the road collapsing. According to my notes, the trailhead for the mountain wasn't too far away, so I parked my car and grabbed my camera. I grabbed a bear bell for protection, too. (Although, if a bear showed up, it's not going to care that I have a bell.)</p><p>The trail entrance wasn't too far away. It was around just a few bends of the mountain road. On the edge of one of the bends, was a small, yet clear sign indicating the entrance of the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail left the dirt road and went up into the trees. The trail was completely covered in leaves, but there was a clear break in the trees and twigs which guided me further up and down the side of the mountain.</p><p>About halfway up the trail, it became completely covered in overgrown brush.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From above, it seemed like there was no organization. Once you entered the brush, each direction looked the same. The brush was about as tall as I was, so I had to crouch walk to keep place with the trail.

| October 23, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last year, I went to Ghibli Park for the first time. I bought the premium Sanpo-pass, so I was able to visit all of the outdoor areas as well as enter the Ghibli Warehouse. The Ghibli Warehouse is very similar to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, but it is much larger and has more areas to explore. You can also take photos throughout the building. :)</p><p>This year, I went back to Ghibli Park twice in September and October. In September, Zach, Dirk, and I had tickets for a Gyoza festival happening in the same park. This was also the hottest day I had ever experienced in Japan. My dash read 43 or 45 degrees. We walked around to a few areas of Ghibli Park, but didn't have tickets. The second time was in October with Jason, and I had purchased the Mononoke/Witches pass.</p><p>In the time since writing <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-park" title="/ghibli-park">my article last year</a>, purchasing tickets for Ghibli park have become much more convoluted. At the time of purchasing my October tickets, there were 7 or 8 different tiers of tickets. Each of the outside areas was split into their own ticket and each had an up-sell of entering the Ghibli Warehouse. Even though it was weeks after they were available, I could get a ticket that gave entry for the Mononoke Village, Valley of the Witches, and Ghibli Warehouse.</p><p><i>Update Dec 2025</i>: Tickets for Ghibli Park have changed again to become simple like they were before. Now there are only two tiers of tickets available. One ticket that offers entry to all areas of the park. And a second ticket identical to the one I bought for October. It seems like the only way you can enter Hill of Youth and Dondoko Hill is by buying the 7500<span class='ja'>円</span> ticket.</p><p>Even though, we only had tickets for entry in the Valley of the Witches, <b>standby tickets</b> were still available to entry buildings. The premium tickets guarantee entry to these buildings. In the Valley of the Witches, there are 3 buildings: Howl's Moving Castle, the Okino Residence, and The House of the Witches. Howl's Castle sold quickly, but we could visit the two other homes. :) (No photos, though.)</p><p>Our Entry for the Ghibli Warehouse was at 3pm, so after visiting our outside areas, we went inside, watched our movie, and walked around. Our film this time was <a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out" title="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out">Koro's Big Day Out</a>. At this point, I think I've seen half of the exclusive Museum/Warehouse films.</p><p>I wasn't planning on taking photos, but (1) there was a new area opened in the Warehouse compared to last time, (2) at the end of the day, big lines for photo opportunities were really short, and (3) also it was generally not so crowded allowing for more photos elsewhere. So, below, you can take a look of the photos, and compare them with <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-warehouse" title="/ghibli-warehouse">my Warehouse photos from last year.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Showa Hall Additions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/showa-hall-additions">Showa Hall Additions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It is a retro museum that showcases many common things from Japanese homes and businesses of the Showa Era (roughly 1927 to 1989). Although, in recent years, many items of the early Heisei period (from 1989) have begun sneaking their way in.</p><p>I've visited Showa Hall many times. I took a bunch of photos <a href="/old/v7/showa-hall" title="/showa-hall">back in 2014</a> and recently went <a href="/old/v7/showa-hall-2" title="/showa-hall-2">back to 2023</a> to take a lot more photos. Tourism in Takayama has exploded since my first years living here, so many changes have also happened in Showa Hall. You can see those changes <a href="/old/v7/showa-hall-2" title="/showa-hall-2">in the 2023 post</a>.</p><p>But, even since 2023, there have been more changes, specifically upstairs. In 2023, they had a small video game annex running Super Famicom Minis with cartridges and posters on the wall. They have since removed all of their old music memorablia near there and created a replica of a children's room with several toys and video games connected to old TVs. This is much more of a Heisei room than a Showa room.</p><p>I took several photos of the new area, and some of other areas, too. You can see them below.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hida no Sato Fall Illumination" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hida-no-sato-fall-illumination">Hida no Sato Fall Illumination</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All of these homes were transported from their original locations around Hida Takayama into this village located at the base of the Matsukura mountain. Throughout the year, you can view the old classic homes with some beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons.</p><p>From October 11th to November 9th this year and only on the weekends, you can enter the museum at night and view the homes and the scenery lit up. Only the areas near the central pond were illuminated, so you couldn't view everything in the village. All of the areas away from the center were pitch black and roped off.</p><p>A friend from college, Jason, visited Takayama, and we showed up right as entry for the night illumination began. We got there early enough that the sun had not fully set, and we could easily go in a couple of the homes.
