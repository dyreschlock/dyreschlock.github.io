Once you reach the turn-off from the main road, it takes over 30 minutes of driving on a narrow single lane road through the forest and along valley cliffs to reach the remote buildings. It's deep enough in the forest that cellphone reception is hard to come by.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The purpose of the inn is to relax with nature while shedding the modern conveniences of the Internet and electricity. To become less digital and more analogue. There are very few lights at Doai Onsen and after 10pm, the generator is turned off. The hallways and rooms are only illuminated by lantern at that point, of which there are more than 300 at the inn in various styles. The numerous amount of lanterns have become the mascot of Doai Onsen, so Doai is also known as the Lamp Inn <span class='ja'>ランプの宿</span></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I found this place while searching around on Google Maps looking for places to hike and explore, and with my friends Dirk and Zach coming to visit in September, we decided to give it a try and stay a night. They have a very modern website which made it easy to reserve a room and the prices were very good compared to other expensive onsens and ryokans. Only 15000<span class='ja'>円</span> (~$100) a night, which includes dinner and breakfast.</p><p>After an obnoxious lunch, we arrived around 4pm. There was a bit of confusion on when we were supposed to arrive, but it all worked out. Check-in official began at 3pm, but we could still arive by 5pm. We were sharing the inn with 2 other groups. One group was just a mother and son. The other group was a larger older family of about 6 people. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The inn seemed like the perfect size for our 3 groups. I don't know if any of the rooms had names, but we were given the room nearest to the entrance. There were two connected tatami rooms that were opened up so we had a really large space, a total of 20 tatami mats!  The group of 6 had the whole lower wing to themselves, so they probably had probably double the space.</p><p>While some others had already arrived, we were able to hop in the baths first and have them to ourselves before the other groups. Dinner was served around 6:15pm (later than usual), so there was a lot of time to soak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were separated baths for men and women which alternated in the night and morning. The men had the larger bath in the evening. The baths are kept warm from a wood burning stove underneath, known as the Goemon method. However, heated water from the tap is boiled using electricity from the generator.</p><p>There were two baths available. Both were filled with spring water from the mountain. One was full of water that was naturally heated by the thermals of the mountain. The other was from cool spring water that was manually heated. Both contain the natural minerals that onsen in the mountains are known for, such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, essentially). These baths repair and soothe rough skin and cuts by eating away at dead skin on the surface.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I love sitting in the warm baths. Natural onsens are my favorite. :) The open window looked out over the gorge with the Tsukechi river below. There were the 3 of us in the bath, so we were talking about things. But, it is always nice to just sit in the bath and listen the wind blow through the leaves and the water flow through the river. There were hot and cold taps for the baths, so I could douse myself with cold water when I felt I was getting too hot.</p><p>It was still pretty early out, but it would've been really nice to come back after the sunset and soak in the tub only lit by lantern light. The lanterns keep the insects away, so you could just relax.</p><p>We stayed in the baths for about 40 minutes and were leaving just as the next group came in. We goofed around in the room for about an hour until the hostess notified everyone of dinner.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The dinner was incredible. Often when dinner is served at an enkai or ryokan, there is usually not enough (for me) to go around. I'm always leave feeling unsatisfied and that I could've had more. This was not the case at Doai. The meal began with mountain vegetables <span class='ja'>山菜</span>, tofu, mochi, and some Iwana sashimi. Iwana is the most common and prevalent fish in the rivers of these moutanins, and local restaurants often serve it.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>More and more dishes kept coming out. We had baked Iwana, tempura, and a very large Gohei mochi. Gohei mochi <span class='ja'>五平餅</span> is fried mochi on a stick with a sweet syrup sauce painted on the top. They are usually the size of a popsicle, but this beast was larger than most pancakes. It was so good.</p><p>It was an amazing meal with so much delicious food. One of the best meals I've had in a while.</p><p>With dinner finished, we had the lamp and safety demonstration at 7:30pm. I thought that this would take only a couple of minutes so I could be back in the onsen bath before they closed, but the lamp demonstration was only the beginning of the night's activities.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Arriving in the common area, we were given a puzzle, a wooden needle threaded in a denim jacket. "Remove the needle from the jacket and get a prize!" It seemed pretty easy and I remember seeing a similar looking puzzle on YouTube a while ago where a person removed a bike lock from a lamp post. That was a different solve, though.</p><p>We fumbled around at the puzzle until everyone arrived and began the lamp demonstration. The host explained how to correctly light the lamp by achieving the correct flame size after lighting the wick with a match. The two sides of the flame should create an arch when holding the glass above the flame, creating an image that kinda looks like Batman. If the flame is too intense, there's too much wick. The reverse is true too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He also mentioned that because the wick is completely soaked in oil, it never burns itself. The wick isn't like the wick of a candle. If the flame dies down, it's because of the oil running low, not because the wick is too low. As such, you should never push too much of the wick out of the base. In the short term, you might get the light you want, but after an hour there will be a massive flame burning out of the lantern. ALWAYS make sure the initial lighting creates the batman shape, and the lantern will be fine for the whole night.</p><p>Also, when you want to extinguish the flame, don't mess with the wick. Simply blow over the top of the glass and the air circulation will put out the light.</p><p>We were each given our own lantern to light the correct way. The wicks were already in the best position, so we didn't have to mess with it. After striking our match and lighting the wick, we just observed the flame's shape to verify it was correct.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then, continuing with lighting lanterns, he had us lighting the lamps using the arcane method of flint and steel, the same way his Japanese ancestors like lanterns. We started off with a standard cut of steel against stones. But, if we couldn't handle it, we could use easier steel which guaranteed sparks. Every strike on the flint should try and knock the sparks into some padded cloth, and then attempt to transfer the spark into the lantern to light it.</p><p>It was not so easy. I could not get the right angle or I was holding it too hard. I moved on to the easy steel and sparks were flying immediately. Lighting the lantern was so much easier using the "starter" steel. Zach and Dirk were much better at using the true steel method.</p><p>Moving on from the lantern, there were many more activities. We continued with the wooden thread puzzle, and he continued to give us more and more hints until we understood how to solve it. Upon solving it, we could keep the wooden needle and as a prize, we were given an extra one to give to a friend.

The host said there were more games in the morning, and you can win a prize if you remember how to tie the ropes.

The hallways filled with the warm light. Although, if we had to use the bathroom, we just used the light on our phones.</p><p>If I was alone, I would have loved to fall asleep to the wind in the trees and the water in the river. But, I put in my earphones to guarantee that I could actually sleep through the night without waking from the smallest of sounds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The morning came and the light filled our room. It was around 6:30, I think? I heard some odd pinking sound, which I thought was water drops tinking into a thin metal gutter. It was not. </p><p>Some of the other family members were in the common area with the host's BB rifle shooting at a tin target in the forest. I went to join them and shot a few rounds. If you called your shot and hit the target within 2 tries, you won a prize, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.webp">a compact flint and steel set with some cloth to catch the spark</a>.</p><p>The baths were open at 7am, so I went back to the room to gather my things for the bath.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We were on the left side now. It was the same layout, except the baths were slightly smaller. It was totally fine though. You don't want to stay in the bath for very long in the morning, otherwise you'll waste all your strength for the day. I think I spent about 15 minutes in the water as others came and went.</p><p>Back in the common area, more of us gathered to shoot airguns and play with the wooden games he had laid out. Those host asked us if we remembered the knot tying from the previous night. By performing the knot successfully, the prize was a bear bell to use in the forest when hiking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At 8 o'clock, our breakfast was served.

It is one of the first villages along the Otani Valley, part of the five valleys of the area. After the village designations of the late 1800s, it became part of Toga Village, which is kinda weird, but maybe not.</p><p>The whole area of southwest Toyama is split into five major valleys. Toga Valley is the eastern-most one, with Otani Valley directly to the west. All of these valleys are very long and winding. Today, it takes about 30 minutes to reach the center of Toga Village from the valley base by car. It takes about 10 minutes from the same location to reach Shimohara going down the Otani valley.</p><p>I don't know how they expected these students to travel the distance back to the valley base and trek 3-times the distance up another valley to reach school each day.</p><p>Well, the government must've thought the same way because in 1935 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>10 they built a branch school in the center of this village, titles <b>Toga Element School - Shimohara Winter Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀小学校下原冬季分校</span>. Apparently, roads were established enough for students to make the trip outside of winter. When the school was built they were 16 students. Later in 1973 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>48, it became an all-year branch school before closing in 1986 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>61.</p><p>This was according to research done by <a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html">Heyaneko</a>. Much like other school buildings in the distant old villages of Toga Valley, some people began living in the building for a time. But, the building had been completely vacant for about 20 years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, it's gone. Google Maps still shows the building being there, but it's using imagery from May 2024. So, it must've been demolished last year. Many of these old buildings used a lot of asbestos, so with no one maintaining them, they've become an incredible danger and must be removed.</p><p>I took some photos of the empty lot, and went up the hill to visit the village's shrine.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the Shimohara Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'>下原八幡宮</span>. Hachiman Shrines are dedicated to the Shinto god Hachiman. He is apparently a god of archery and war, so he was a favorite god of many samurai. Many farmers and fisherman also pray to Hachiman for a bountiful harvest or a bountiful amount of fish in their nets.</p><p>This shrine was a bit unique as the Shishi Lion statues out front looked very stunted compared to ones I've seen at other shrines. Maybe these statues were the original ones from hundreds of years ago, never refreshed or reformed.</p><p>The shrine itself was protected by a wall of plexiglass surrounding the entire building. The front could be opened to enter, pray, and give your offering.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This small pocket of civilization seems pretty representative of the many villages that dot these valleys. People often refer to them as islands because of how isolated they can be. Shimohara is pretty representative of this as the walls of the valley are so steep there's really nothing around except for the next pocket village down the road 10 minutes or back up the road for 10 minutes.</p><p>It's obviously easy to travel to all these village today with the roads and tunnels carved out of the mountains. But these roads have only been established since after the war in the 60s and 70s. 100 years ago, people were probably only traveling to these villages by boat.</p><p>People still live in Shimohara today. There were four homes, and had their cars parked nearby. With the concrete school building gone, the area feels like its gotten closer to nature again.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/abandoned-oshiba-settlement">Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was small enough and close enough to another village that I don't think anyone considered in an actual village. Thus, it was given the designation of shuraku <span class='ja'>集落</span> instead of mura <span class='ja'>村</span>. </p><p>At its height, it seems like there were 10 homes clustered together with 100 people liviing there. This was during the Meiji period. In the year 2000, no one was registered as living here. Japanese Blogger Akirango visited <a href="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121" title="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121">the area in 2020</a>, and did a lot of research on the old village.</p><p>When he visited in 2020, there were apparently several homes in the area. Most of them had been completely abandoned and several had collapsed or were on the brink of collapsing. He noted that one home looked like some folks still returned every now and then to check on it. <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html">Mr. Murakage</a> also visited the village in 2011. His page shows the population of the village since 1872 (Meiji 5).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, anyone who still owned land in Oshiba must've died or sold it to the government because the construction companies have moved in and begun cutting down the forest surrounding the village. Google Maps doesn't show any of this, but it's using satellite images from May 2024. So all this deforestation happened last summer or this summer.</p><p>Also, looking on Google Map, the road leading to the village has had some changes in the last year, too. The village road branches off from Route 471 leading to the center of Toga Village. Near the crossing, the road had been taken out by a landslide, and construction crews have been building a new support bridge going from the main road down to the village area.</p><p>So, maybe they started cutting down trees last year, and the road was taken out over winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the most important construction related projects in the area is the Toga Dam. Apparently, they've been working on this dam for almost 20 years. Looking looking at various old posts of people exploring the villages and schools in the area, looking through Google Maps, and also going there, it seems they area is full of construction from summer to fall.</p><p>Open areas have temporary dorms set up for workers. The road-side stop <span class='ja'>道の駅</span> further north on 471 had several billboards targetted at workers. It says how to avoid heatstroke while working in summer, and how it's okay to stop working if you feel too hot. The occasional truck or marked cars are parked along Route 471, too.</p><p>It seems like they could be clearing the forest for something related to the dam.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While all the homes seemed to have been removed, the Shinmei Shrine <span class='ja'>神明宮</span> was still there, left untouched for now. Shinmei Shrines are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture was important.</p><p>In his post, Akirango wondered what the shrine would say about the history of its village, both the rise and the fall. I don't think anyone would have considered Oshiba a vibrant village. But even so, I suppose the shrine would have gotten lonely with its residents slowly moving away.</p><p>The nearby <a href="/old/v7/kitamamedani-branch-school" title="/kitamamedani-branch-school">Kitamamedani Branch School</a> used to have a winter branch school in Oshiba. It's full title was Toga Elementary Kitamamedani Branch School - Oshiba Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校北豆谷分校押場冬季分校</span>. It opened in 1930 (Showa 2) and closed in 1968 (Showa 43), which is also when the Kitamamedani branch school closed. In 1943, it apparently had 11 students.</p><p>Would the shrine feel sad that children were no longer around? Or happy that they've found a more lucrative life elsewhere? Would the shrine feel sad that the remains of the town had been removed? Or happy that the area had become lively again with activity?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The outside of the shrine looked like it was pretty well intact. However, the inside didn't look so great. Much of the walls showed signs of termites. Ceiling boards looked like they were peeling and melting away. With absolutely no one in the area now returning, the shrine doesn't seem like it's going to survive many more winters.</p><p>The was a painting of Nagoya Castle on the wall. There were also samurai horse paintings on the wall facing outwards. These are pretty similar to <a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">Ema Paintings</a> in Hida. By facing outwards, the luck and protection is extended to the people and happenings outside of the building.</p><p>Eventually (probably in the not so distant future), the shrine will be gone and very little trace of the Oshiba settlement will remain. Only the photos and stories of those who've been here.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamimomose-branch-school">Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

One important part of this history was the postal service. </p><p>Until 1970, especially in the winter, because of the large amounts of winter mountain snow, mail was still carried by hand. Carriers of Johana Town would bring the mail to the Hosoo Postal Exchange where they would meet carriers from Taira Village. Both teams left at 9am and met around 1pm. They would exchange their packages and letters. Then, they'd go back down the mountain to their post offices. These folks were known as the Postal Corps <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span>.</p><p>The <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office</a> <span class='ja'>細尾峠郵便交換所</span> was one of the places I visited when I explored Hosoo Pass. I went there on June 3rd. It turns out that just a days prior on May 31st, they held a dedication ceremony for the creation of a monument devoted to the Taira Postal Corps in Taira Village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the Postal Corps and includes 3 photos taken in the 1960s. There are a few individual credits on the back of the monument. The <span class='ja'>郵送隊之碑</span> calligraphy was done by Fumio Yamamoto <span class='ja'>山本文雄</span>. And the 3 photos were taken by Toshio Takada <span class='ja'>高田</span> <span class='ja'>俊夫</span>, Shinobu Soga <span class='ja'>曽我忍</span>, and Tsutomu Takada <span class='ja'>高田勉</span>.</p><p>The May 31st ceremoney was held by the mayor, the chairs of the commeration committee, and Shinobu Soga, one of the men who took a photo of the Postal Corps.

In the article, it mentions how Soga was a location scout for a film studio in Kyoto and came to Gokayama looking for locations. He learned of the Postal Corps and wanted to travel with them and learn more.</p><p>In the end, he could get some amazing unique photos of the team. Of the three photos on the monument, I think this one was his.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the other photos shows the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office in the 60s in winter. Having been there a few weeks prior, they apparently made an addition to the building sometime in the 60s. The plaque in the Postal Exchange Office mentioned that mail increased significantly in the 60s because of economic reform. The Postal Corps chain would somtimes include up to 30 members.

At that time, the Taira and Johana Post Offices organized contractors into teams to carry mail on their backs to the postal exchange office located near Hosoo Pass, 740 meters above sea level.</p><p><span class='ja'>明治十五年下梨郵便局</span>(<span class='ja'>現平局</span>)<span class='ja'>開設されて以来、城端局と片道約二〇</span>km<span class='ja'>の峠山道を徒歩で往復していました。昭和十年長い間続いた直送を廃し、両局の中程に位置する細尾峠で郵袋を交換する方法なりました。その後、バスの開通に伴い通常期はバス託送に改め、昭和三十年から請負による交換便は冬期に限られることになりました。深雪・吹雪の中隊員苦労は想像を絶するものでした。</span></p><p>Since Shimonashi Post Office (now Taira Post Office) was opened in 1882, mail was sent back and forth between Johana Post Office on foot along the mountain pass, about 20km one-way**. In 1935, the long-running direct delivery system was discontinued, as the method of mail exchange was changed to bus delivery at Hosoo Pass, located between the two offices. After that, the normal period was changed to bus delivery, and from 1955, the contracted exchange service was limited to winter. The hardships faced by the members of the Postal Corps in the deep snow and blizzards were unimaginable.</p><p>(**note: The monument says one-way, but it's only 10 km one-way. It's 20 km round trip.)</p><p><span class='ja'>時代と共に、請負人の雇用難・雪崩危険等に鑑み、昭和四十五年八十八年間に渡る郵送隊のの歴史を閉じました。その後冬期は庄川の船便等を利用する輸送となり昭和五十九年</span>,<span class='ja'>国道三〇四号線に五箇山トンネルが開通したことにより、専用自動車便が通年運行され、現在に至っています。</span></p><p>As times changed, the Postal Corps came to an end after 88 years of operation in 1970, due to the difficulty of finding contractors and the risk of avalanches. After that, transportation in the winter was changed to ship services on the Shogawa River. In 1984, the Gokayama Tunnel was opened on National Route 304, and dedicated automobile services began to operate year-round, which continues to this day.</p><p><span class='ja'>郵送隊の大きな功績は</span><br/>The Great Achievements of the Postal Corps</p><p><span class='ja'>・厳冬の雪深い峠道を人力で郵便物</span>(<span class='ja'>生活必需品</span>)<span class='ja'>を運び地域住民の暮らしを支えた。</span><br/>- They carried mail (a daily necessity) by hand through snowy mountain passes in the harsh winter, supporting the lives of local residents.</p><p><span class='ja'>・隊員の大半は主婦で女性の忍耐と献身性が特筆される。</span><br/>- Most of the members were housewives, and the perserverance and dedication of women is particulary noteworthy.</p><p><span class='ja'>・郵便局では</span> <span class='ja'>地域への奉仕・貢献の原点として語り継がれている。</span><br/>- At the post office, it is passed down as the origin of service and contribution to the community.</p><p><span class='ja'>ここにその功績を称え</span> <span class='ja'>史実を後世に伝えるものです。</span><br/>Here, we commemorate their achievements and pass on the historical facts to future generations.</p><p><span class='ja'>令和七年五月</span> - May 2025<br/><span class='ja'>郵送隊を称える会</span> - The Postal Corps Commemoration Committee</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument is a great way of commemorating such a unique service in the area.

At the time of its construction, there were two major elementary schools in the municipality of Taira Village, Shimonashi Elementary and Higashi Nakae Elementary. However, each one had plenty of branch schools that served as the students' actual day-to-day school. Students probably only went to the main school for the entrance ceremony and graduation.</p><p>I'm not sure when it opened, but it was closed in 1962 and all students went to Shimonashi Elementary. The branch school is located in the Kogurusu neighborhood <span class='ja'>小来栖</span> directly north of downtown Shimonashi Village where Shimonashi Elementary was located. </p><p>These days its only a 5 minute drive, so it seems somewhat frivolous to have created a school so close. However, travel in Japan prior to the 60s was not so easy. The neighborhood is a somewhat decent climb from Shimonashi, and far too dangerous for a child to make the hike in winter. The village probably didn't have busses until the 1960s, so building a small school was easier. Even in Kogurusu, neighboring houses are at a pretty steep incline, so walking to school was still a challenge.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school was featured in Toyama Prefecture's series showcasing the <a href="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=1801" title="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=1801">wooden schools</a> of the past, and the old wooden building still exists today. It has been used pretty frequently as a community center for those living in the neighborhood since its closure as a school. Inside, in the entrance, are some commerative photos taken at neighborhood events. The most recent one was from 2016 for the Kogurusu Summer Festival <span class='ja'>小来栖の夏祭り</span>. The was the most recent thing I found inside the building.</p><p>The building is pretty small with only a few rooms on the first and second floors. The first room on the first floor was an open room with some tables and some other equipment. The room further back on the ground floor was also used for storage, however the floor had been eroded away leaving the dirt exposed. Going inside, bats started flying around the ceiling, so I didn't stay inside for long. I think this may have been the living quarters.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs was a much larger open room. Half of the room had Tatami, and the other half had the equipment used for their summer festival. On the wall near the doors, were some awards. In 1990 (Heisei 2), Taira Village apparently held a competition for morning exercises among the farming community. The Hanahikara (?) group <span class='ja'>はなひからの部</span> got first place, and their award was on the wall. The Koshihikari group <span class='ja'>コシヒカリの部</span> (koshihikari is a kind of rice) got second place.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0946_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0946_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0946_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0946_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0946_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the wall facing the tatami mats was the Taira Village Town Charter <span class='ja'>平村民憲章</span>. It reads as follows:</p><p><span class='ja'>わたくしにちは、五筒の美しい自然と香り高い文化遺産の伝承に誇りと責任ともち活力ある平村をめざしてこの憲章と定新ます。</span><br/>We take pride in and responsibility for the beautiful nature of Gokayama, the fragrant cultural heritage of our village, and set out to create a vibrant village.</p><p><span class='ja'>一、おたがいに信じあい励ましあって、住みよい村とつくります。</span><br/>First, we will trust and encourage each other to create a pleasant village to live.</p><p><span class='ja'>二、きびしい自然にうちから生産につとめて、豊かな村をつくります</span><br/>Second, we will endevor to continue production in the harsh natural environment to create a rich village.</p><p><span class='ja'>三、伝統を生かし文化と育てて、うるわしい村とつくります。</span><br/>Third, we will make use of traditions and foster culture to create a beautiful village.</p><p><span class='ja'>四、感謝の心をもち家族助けあって、むつまじい家とつくります</span><br/>Fourth, we will be grateful and help each other as family members to create a harmonious community.</p><p><span class='ja'>五、からだときにえ教養と高めて、たくましい人になります。</span><br/>Five, we will improve our physical and cultural abilities to become strong people.</p><p>While many of the outer areas of Taira have been vacated from depopulation, the downtown area of Taira and the communities along the river still feel very vibrant. While driving around, I saw several tourists visiting the old Gasshou homes and going in and out of local stores.</p><p>However, times continue to change.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_1015.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_1015.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_1015_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_1015_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_1015_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As transportation became stronger, and as more people moved away to cities, more and more branch schools closed and the students could join the main elementaries. By the 1990s, Taira village only had two elementary schools: Higashi Nakae Elementary School and Shimonashi Elementary School. In 1999, Higashi Nakae ES closed and students now attended Shimonashi, but it with the combination, the school was renamed to Taira Elementary School.</p><p>In 2004, Japan issued widespread municipal mergers across all the rurals areas of the country. The three separate Gokayama municipalities of Taira, Toga, and Kamitaira combined with five other villages to the west and north to create Nanto City. In 2006, Taira Elementary was closed and students traveled further down the road to Kamitaira Elementary. Perhaps as a trade-off, students of Kamitaira came to Taira for junior high school.</p><p>The old Taira Elementary School was turned into government offices, many of which focused on research for ground water and hydro electricity.</p><p>A few years ago, the building has been completely demolished. Now it serves as an emergency port for helicopter landings if any citizens need to extremely fast transport to a hospital in the city up north. <br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (32)
