| June 29, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Shimohara Village was a small village or settlement in the southwestern area of modern day Toyama Prefecture. It is one of the first villages along the Otani Valley, part of the five valleys of the area. After the village designations of the late 1800s, it became part of Toga Village, which is kinda weird, but maybe not.</p><p>The whole area of southwest Toyama is split into five major valleys. Toga Valley is the eastern-most one, with Otani Valley directly to the west. All of these valleys are very long and winding. Today, it takes about 30 minutes to reach the center of Toga Village from the valley base by car. It takes about 10 minutes from the same location to reach Shimohara going down the Otani valley.</p><p>I don't know how they expected these students to travel the distance back to the valley base and trek 3-times the distance up another valley to reach school each day.</p><p>Well, the government must've thought the same way because in 1935 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>10 they built a branch school in the center of this village, titles <b>Toga Element School - Shimohara Winter Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀小学校下原冬季分校</span>. Apparently, roads were established enough for students to make the trip outside of winter. When the school was built they were 16 students. Later in 1973 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>48, it became an all-year branch school before closing in 1986 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>61.</p><p>This was according to research done by <a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html">Heyaneko</a>. Much like other school buildings in the distant old villages of Toga Valley, some people began living in the building for a time. But, the building had been completely vacant for about 20 years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, it's gone. Google Maps still shows the building being there, but it's using imagery from May 2024. So, it must've been demolished last year. Many of these old buildings used a lot of asbestos, so with no one maintaining them, they've become an incredible danger and must be removed.</p><p>I took some photos of the empty lot, and went up the hill to visit the village's shrine.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the Shimohara Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'>下原八幡宮</span>. Hachiman Shrines are dedicated to the Shinto god Hachiman. He is apparently a god of archery and war, so he was a favorite god of many samurai. Many farmers and fisherman also pray to Hachiman for a bountiful harvest or a bountiful amount of fish in their nets.</p><p>This shrine was a bit unique as the Shishi Lion statues out front looked very stunted compared to ones I've seen at other shrines. Maybe these statues were the original ones from hundreds of years ago, never refreshed or reformed.</p><p>The shrine itself was protected by a wall of plexiglass surrounding the entire building. The front could be opened to enter, pray, and give your offering.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This small pocket of civilization seems pretty representative of the many villages that dot these valleys. People often refer to them as islands because of how isolated they can be. Shimohara is pretty representative of this as the walls of the valley are so steep there's really nothing around except for the next pocket village down the road 10 minutes or back up the road for 10 minutes.</p><p>It's obviously easy to travel to all these village today with the roads and tunnels carved out of the mountains. But these roads have only been established since after the war in the 60s and 70s. 100 years ago, people were probably only traveling to these villages by boat.</p><p>People still live in Shimohara today. There were four homes, and had their cars parked nearby. With the concrete school building gone, the area feels like its gotten closer to nature again.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/abandoned-oshiba-settlement">Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 29, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Oshiba Village or Oshiba Settlement was one of the smaller villages in Toga Valley. It was small enough and close enough to another village that I don't think anyone considered in an actual village. Thus, it was given the designation of shuraku <span class='ja'>集落</span> instead of mura <span class='ja'>村</span>. </p><p>At its height, it seems like there were 10 homes clustered together with 100 people liviing there. This was during the Meiji period. In the year 2000, no one was registered as living here. Japanese Blogger Akirango visited <a href="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121" title="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121">the area in 2020</a>, and did a lot of research on the old village.</p><p>When he visited in 2020, there were apparently several homes in the area. Most of them had been completely abandoned and several had collapsed or were on the brink of collapsing. He noted that one home looked like some folks still returned every now and then to check on it. <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html">Mr. Murakage</a> also visited the village in 2011. His page shows the population of the village since 1872 (Meiji 5).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, anyone who still owned land in Oshiba must've died or sold it to the government because the construction companies have moved in and begun cutting down the forest surrounding the village. Google Maps doesn't show any of this, but it's using satellite images from May 2024. So all this deforestation happened last summer or this summer.</p><p>Also, looking on Google Map, the road leading to the village has had some changes in the last year, too. The village road branches off from Route 471 leading to the center of Toga Village. Near the crossing, the road had been taken out by a landslide, and construction crews have been building a new support bridge going from the main road down to the village area.</p><p>So, maybe they started cutting down trees last year, and the road was taken out over winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the most important construction related projects in the area is the Toga Dam. Apparently, they've been working on this dam for almost 20 years. Looking looking at various old posts of people exploring the villages and schools in the area, looking through Google Maps, and also going there, it seems they area is full of construction from summer to fall.</p><p>Open areas have temporary dorms set up for workers. The road-side stop <span class='ja'>道の駅</span> further north on 471 had several billboards targetted at workers. It says how to avoid heatstroke while working in summer, and how it's okay to stop working if you feel too hot. The occassional truck or marked cars are parked along Route 471, too.</p><p>It seems like they could be clearing the forest for something related to the dam.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While all the homes seemed to have been removed, the Shinmei Shrine <span class='ja'>神明宮</span> was still there, left untouched for now. Shinmei Shrines are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture was important.</p><p>In his post, Akirango wondered what the shrine would say about the history of its village, both the rise and the fall. I don't think anyone would have considered Oshiba a vibrant village. But even so, I suppose the shrine would have gotten lonely with its residents slowly moving away.</p><p>The nearby <a href="/old/v7/kitamamedani-branch-school" title="/kitamamedani-branch-school">Kitamamedani Branch School</a> used to have a winter branch school in Oshiba. It's full title was Toga Elementary Kitamamedani Branch School - Oshiba Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校北豆谷分校押場冬季分校</span>. It opened in 1930 (Showa 2) and closed in 1968 (Showa 43), which is also when the Kitamamedani branch school closed. In 1943, it apparently had 11 students.</p><p>Would the shrine feel sad that children were no longer around? Or happy that they've found a more lucrative life elsewhere? Would the shrine feel sad that the remains of the town had been removed? Or happy that the area had become lively again with activity?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The outside of the shrine looked like it was pretty well intact. However, the inside didn't look so great. Much of the walls showed signs of termites. Ceiling boards looked like they were peeling and melting away. With absolutely no one in the area now returning, the shrine doesn't seem like it's going to survive many more winters.</p><p>The was a painting of Nagoya Castle on the wall. There were also samurai horse paintings on the wall facing outwards. These are pretty similar to <a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">Ema Paintings</a> in Hida. By facing outwards, the luck and protection is extended to the people and happenings outside of the building.</p><p>Eventually (probably in the not so distant future), the shrine will be gone and very little trace of the Oshiba settlement will remain. Only the photos and stories of those who've been here.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamimomose-branch-school">Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The single road in town follows the river up into the mountains, going around Mt. Kongodo <span class='ja'>金剛堂山</span>, and coming into Miyagawa, Gifu, on the other side.</p><p>The current neighborhood on Kamimomose seems pretty vibrant enough these days, which several self-help facilities and performance arts camps. Many of the homes look pretty modern and maintained.</p><p>Up until a few years ago, the building of the former branch school was still standing in town. This was the Toga Elementary Kamimomose Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校上百瀬分校</span>. Like many of the other branch schools in the area, it was probably still in use until 1996, and then closed for good.</p><p>The building still stood for 25 years, but no one maintained it, so it began falling apart and became a health hazard because of asbestos. Looking through Google Maps and Google Earth, it was demolished sometime between November 2021 and October 2023.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the gymansium still stands, but it has been completely gutted.

Now with the building gone, it has become the perfect open garage to store their larger equipment.</p><p>After the main building was demolished, it seems like they repaired and reenforced the roof. The old Google Maps show it is red. But, today, it's a reflective black surface. Sometimes it looks blue because of the sky's reflection.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tanoshima Shinmei Shrine 田ノ島神明宮" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tanoshima-shinmei-shrine">Tanoshima Shinmei Shrine 田ノ島神明宮</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The site of the village is along the Toga River going south up the mountain from Sakaue village. It's between the villages of Abetto and Taikanba.</p><p>A branch school was opened in the village for its children. In 1959, there were 16 students. But the school was closed 6 years later. Perhaps this was because many of the younger families moved away or because a bus service could be established between the village in Sakaue village nearby. The concrete branch schools in the area were built in the 1970s, so this building would've been made out of wood.</p><p>In 2013, <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134">Hayaneko</a> visited the village and only 2 houses remained, with one of the houses actually being lived in. Today, all traces of those homes have been removed for some kind of fancy French restaurant and rental cabins.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking in, it reminded me a lot of the restaurant from The Menu. Apparently meals are more than 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> a plate.</p><p>The side road continues past the restaurant into the forest, and eventually ends with the forest engulfing the road. I wasn't paying attention to the map, so I didn't realize that I went past the shrine quite a while ago. Going back to the restaurant, the shrine is located up on the hill behind the area. You can see it from the road peering through the trees.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Shinmei Shrines <span class='ja'>神明宮</span> are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture is most important.</p><p>Throughout Toga Valley and many rural areas, it's pretty easy to find Shinmei Shrines, as their yearly festivals pray to the gods for an abundant harvest.</p><p>With no one left in the village, I'm not really sure who maintains this shrine. Inside the shrine, a plaque showing the names of all the Shinto priests lies on its side, and hasn't been updated in years. Perhaps the folks running the restaurant keep up the old rituals.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Senzoku Branch School 千束分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/senzoku-branch-school">Senzoku Branch School 千束分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was built in 1970 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>45 to service the 54 students living in Taikanba Village. Originally, it was named Toga Elementary Taikanba Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校大勘場分校</span>. Later, after some school shuffling, it was renamed to Sakagami Elementary Senzoku Branch School <span class='ja'>坂上小学校千束分校</span>.</p><p>By 1975, there were only 31 students. By 1984 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>59, the school was no longer regularly used, and in 1996 <span class='ja'>平成</span>8, it was closed completely. According to <a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">Heyaneko</a>, who visited the location in 2011, there was a personalized mailbox, indicating that someone was living there. <a href="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html" title="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html">Haiko Rider</a> visited the location in 2014 and posts that a construction company was using the location for storage.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_07_senzoku/IMG_1277_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the building is no longer there.

One important part of this history was the postal service. </p><p>Until 1970, especially in the winter, because of the large amounts of winter mountain snow, mail was still carried by hand. Carriers of Johana Town would bring the mail to the Hosoo Postal Exchange where they would meet carriers from Taira Village. Both teams left at 9am and met around 1pm. They would exchange their packages and letters. Then, they'd go back down the mountain to their post offices. These folks were known as the Postal Corps <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span>.</p><p>The <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office</a> <span class='ja'>細尾峠郵便交換所</span> was one of the places I visited when I explored Hosoo Pass. I went there on June 3rd. It turns out that just a days prior on May 31st, they held a dedication ceremony for the creation of a monument devoted to the Taira Postal Corps in Taira Village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the Postal Corps and includes 3 photos taken in the 1960s. There are a few individual credits on the back of the monument. The <span class='ja'>郵送隊之碑</span> calligraphy was done by Fumio Yamamoto <span class='ja'>山本文雄</span>. And the 3 photos were taken by Toshio Takada <span class='ja'>高田</span> <span class='ja'>俊夫</span>, Shinobu Soga <span class='ja'>曽我忍</span>, and Tsutomu Takada <span class='ja'>高田勉</span>.</p><p>The May 31st ceremoney was held by the mayor, the chairs of the commeration committee, and Shinobu Soga, one of the men who took a photo of the Postal Corps. The Yomiuri Newspaper wrote <a href="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/" title="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/">an article about it</a>. In the article, it mentions how Soga was a location scout for a film studio in Kyoto and came to Gokayama looking for locations. He learned of the Postal Corps and wanted to travel with them and learn more.</p><p>In the end, he could get some amazing unique photos of the team. Of the three photos on the monument, I think this one was his.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the other photos shows the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office in the 60s in winter. Having been there a few weeks prior, they apparently made an addition to the building sometime in the 60s. The plaque in the Postal Exchange Office mentioned that mail increased significantly in the 60s because of economic reform. The Postal Corps chain would somtimes include up to 30 members. So, I suppose they needed the extra space for the package exchange.</p><p>Here's a <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information">transcription and translation</a> of the plaque at the Postal Exchange office in the woods in the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plaque on the monument gives a brief history of the Postal Corps. Here's a transcription and translation of the contents:</p><p><span class='ja'>かって、冬期間積雪により交通機関が断され</span> <span class='ja'>陸の孤島と化していた越中五箇山の人々に</span> <span class='ja'>文化の火をもたらす役割を果たたのが</span> <span class='ja'>郵便遞送隊</span>(<span class='ja'>通称</span> <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span>)<span class='ja'>でした。</span> <span class='ja'>当時、平・城端両郵便局では請負人を雇用隊を編成して標高七四〇</span>m<span class='ja'>の細尾峠近くに設けられた郵便交換所まで背負って運び渡していました。</span></p><p>The Postal Transport Corps (commonly known as the Postal Corps) played a role in bringing a firey culture to the people of Etchu Gokayama, who were once isolated village islands in the winter when transportation was cut off due to snowfall. At that time, the Taira and Johana Post Offices organized contractors into teams to carry mail on their backs to the postal exchange office located near Hosoo Pass, 740 meters above sea level.</p><p><span class='ja'>明治十五年下梨郵便局</span>(<span class='ja'>現平局</span>)<span class='ja'>開設されて以来、城端局と片道約二〇</span>km<span class='ja'>の峠山道を徒歩で往復していました。昭和十年長い間続いた直送を廃し、両局の中程に位置する細尾峠で郵袋を交換する方法なりました。その後、バスの開通に伴い通常期はバス託送に改め、昭和三十年から請負による交換便は冬期に限られることになりました。深雪・吹雪の中隊員苦労は想像を絶するものでした。</span></p><p>Since Shimonashi Post Office (now Taira Post Office) was opened in 1882, mail was sent back and forth between Johana Post Office on foot along the mountain pass, about 20km one-way**. In 1935, the long-running direct delivery system was discontinued, as the method of mail exchange was changed to bus delivery at Hosoo Pass, located between the two offices. After that, the normal period was changed to bus delivery, and from 1955, the contracted exchange service was limited to winter. The hardships faced by the members of the Postal Corps in the deep snow and blizzards were unimaginable.</p><p>(**note: The monument says one-way, but it's only 10 km one-way. It's 20 km round trip.)</p><p><span class='ja'>時代と共に、請負人の雇用難・雪崩危険等に鑑み、昭和四十五年八十八年間に渡る郵送隊のの歴史を閉じました。その後冬期は庄川の船便等を利用する輸送となり昭和五十九年</span>,<span class='ja'>国道三〇四号線に五箇山トンネルが開通したことにより、専用自動車便が通年運行され、現在に至っています。</span></p><p>As times changed, the Postal Corps came to an end after 88 years of operation in 1970, due to the difficulty of finding contractors and the risk of avalanches. After that, transportation in the winter was changed to ship services on the Shogawa River. In 1984, the Gokayama Tunnel was opened on National Route 304, and dedicated automobile services began to operate year-round, which continues to this day.</p><p><span class='ja'>郵送隊の大きな功績は</span><br/>The Great Achievements of the Postal Corps</p><p><span class='ja'>・厳冬の雪深い峠道を人力で郵便物</span>(<span class='ja'>生活必需品</span>)<span class='ja'>を運び地域住民の暮らしを支えた。</span><br/>- They carried mail (a daily necessity) by hand through snowy mountain passes in the harsh winter, supporting the lives of local residents.</p><p><span class='ja'>・隊員の大半は主婦で女性の忍耐と献身性が特筆される。</span><br/>- Most of the members were housewives, and the perserverance and dedication of women is particulary noteworthy.</p><p><span class='ja'>・郵便局では</span> <span class='ja'>地域への奉仕・貢献の原点として語り継がれている。</span><br/>- At the post office, it is passed down as the origin of service and contribution to the community.</p><p><span class='ja'>ここにその功績を称え</span> <span class='ja'>史実を後世に伝えるものです。</span><br/>Here, we commemorate their achievements and pass on the historical facts to future generations.</p><p><span class='ja'>令和七年五月</span> - May 2025<br/><span class='ja'>郵送隊を称える会</span> - The Postal Corps Commemoration Committee</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument is a great way of commemorating such a unique service in the area. But, the monument is a little sad. They placed the monument at the location of the original Shimonashi Post Office from 50 years ago, but that building has moved since then.

| June 28, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This school's full name was the Taira Village Municipal Shimonashi Elementary Miune Branch School, or <span class='ja'>平村立下梨小学校三嶺分校</span>. At the time of its construction, there were two major elementary schools in the municipality of Taira Village, Shimonashi Elementary and Higashi Nakae Elementary. However, each one had plenty of branch schools that served as the students' actual day-to-day school. Students probably only went to the main school for the entrance ceremony and graduation.</p><p>I'm not sure when it opened, but it was closed in 1962 and all students went to Shimonashi Elementary. The branch school is located in the Kogurusu neighborhood <span class='ja'>小来栖</span> directly north of downtown Shimonashi Village where Shimonashi Elementary was located. </p><p>These days its only a 5 minute drive, so it seems somewhat frivolous to have created a school so close. However, travel in Japan prior to the 60s was not so easy. The neighborhood is a somewhat decent climb from Shimonashi, and far too dangerous for a child to make the hike in winter. The village probably didn't have busses until the 1960s, so building a small school was easier. Even in Kogurusu, neighboring houses are at a pretty steep incline, so walking to school was still a challenge.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0890_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school was featured in Toyama Prefecture's series showcasing the <a href="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=1801" title="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=1801">wooden schools</a> of the past, and the old wooden building still exists today. It has been used pretty frequently as a community center for those living in the neighborhood since its closure as a school. Inside, in the entrance, are some commerative photos taken at neighborhood events. The most recent one was from 2016 for the Kogurusu Summer Festival <span class='ja'>小来栖の夏祭り</span>. The was the most recent thing I found inside the building.</p><p>The building is pretty small with only a few rooms on the first and second floors. The first room on the first floor was an open room with some tables and some other equipment. The room further back on the ground floor was also used for storage, however the floor had been eroded away leaving the dirt exposed. Going inside, bats started flying around the ceiling, so I didn't stay inside for long. I think this may have been the living quarters.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_03_kogurusu/IMG_0952_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs was a much larger open room. Half of the room had Tatami, and the other half had the equipment used for their summer festival. On the wall near the doors, were some awards. In 1990 (Heisei 2), Taira Village apparently held a competition for morning exercises among the farming community.

Today, what remains of the village is slightly hidden behind the Taira Ski Resort and Restaurant Maple.</p><p>There are several houses in the village still standing, and some of the homes seem like they've had some recently maintenance work done of them. According to some online research done by <a href="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html" title="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html">Mr. Murakage</a>, there were people living in some homes until 1982. Although, even though it doesn't seem like anyone is living here today, the families still come back to check on the houses. He and <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123">Hayaneko</a> visited in 2011 and found no one there, and neither did I during my visit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When parking at the Taira Ski Resort, you can see the village poking through the area behind Restaurant Maple. The restaurant seems like its open every day to cater to the construction workers up in the mountains doing whatever work they do. I arrived before the opening time, and the people working at the restaurant were preparing for the day.</p><p>The road to the village loops behind the restaurant and goes up the hill. You walk past a grave and some monuments. The monuments were too withered away to fully understand them. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.webp">The grave</a> was marked as Hotouge Family <span class='ja'>朴峠家</span>. <a href="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html" title="/pages/murakage-nashitani.html">Murakage-san</a> was able to research the names of the 28 homes that used to be in the village, and he listed them on his page. The Hotouge Family apparently moved to Osaka in the 1960s.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Still standing in the main area of the village were three homes, and a few sheds and garages. The first home was owned by the Yamazaki Family <span class='ja'>山崎家</span>. The next home was owned by the Higashi Family <span class='ja'>東家</span>. The Higashi Family had <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.webp">a grave</a> behind their house, but there was no Yamazaki grave. There was a foundation for a small building behind there, too.</p><p>All the homes in the area had their windows boarded up, and occassionally some extra supports along the outsides. This was mainly to prevent any structural or internal damage happening from excessive snow and snow melt in the winter. As such, the only access to the homes were the front doors, which were all locked.</p><p>There was one more home in this small neighborhood cluster. Rather than wooden supports and protection, it was covered in aluminum siding, which was probably installed in the last 20 years. The whole home seemed like it was perfectly preserved inside its metal shell. Out back, there was a family grave, but I don't remember the name. Guessing, but it was probably for the Tsujimoto Family <span class='ja'>辻本家</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the middle of this neighborhood cluster was the village's temple. The door was open, so I went. It seemed like it was pretty well taken care of for a building that was over 100 years old.</p><p>The temple included a shrine behind the folding walls, but covering the inside walls of the temple were names and names and names of everyone who was a member of the shrine. Every little bit of upper wall space was covered in thin wooden planks, each denoting a single person's membership. The planks didn't have any dates, but according to Murakage's page, the history of the village went back further than the  Meiji period. Many of the names matched Murakage's listing of famliies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking through my photos, this white plaque was the most recent, dated Heisei 10 or 1997 <span class='ja'>平成十年吉日</span>. The title says <span class='ja'>梨谷村道場修繕工事一式</span>, which seems to translate as Nashitani Village Dojo Repair Work All Members. And then it lists 66 members, and an additional 3 executive members <span class='ja'>実行委員</span>. The 3 executive members are Nakai <span class='ja'>中井</span>, Yamazaki <span class='ja'>山崎</span>, and Arai <span class='ja'>荒井</span>. In fact, there are many planks throughout the temple (or dojo?) of the Yamazaki family. Maybe their family were the mayors of the village.</p><p>So, so far, we've seen the Yamazaki Home, Higashi Home, village Temple or Dojo, and Tsujimoto Home. Behind the Tsujimoto home were storage building that were half torn apart and perhaps a few more winters away from complete collapse. The road continued past this cluster, which revealed the Nakai Home <span class='ja'>中井家</span>  on the bend of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There was a walkway going past the Nakai Home into some farm fields and a storage shed was some equipment that was probably still used 10 years ago. Next to the storage shed was the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.webp">family grave</a> for the Uji Family <span class='ja'>宇治家</span>.</p><p>This small area felt very classic country, like the Shire in Lord of the Rings. A wavy stone path with a stone wall connecting homes to homes with circular plots of fields for whatever they grew.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Returning to the Nakai Home, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0846.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0846.webp">their family grave</a> was out front, too. It's important to note that all of these graves were very clean, recognizable, and had recent flowers placed on them. It would seem like these families, whether the original residents are still alive living elsewhere or their descendants, still return here after winter to maintain the houses and the graves. Actually, a whole field of grass near the Nakai home showed signs of it being mowed in the last few weeks.</p><p>Nashitani Village is abandoned in that no one lives here, but it's not so abandoned that people haven't forgotten about it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, the final home in the area, the Kuribayashi Home <span class='ja'>栗林</span>, had quite a lot of recent repair work done on the front, including a new door with its <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.webp">wrapping</a> still on.</p><p>Murakage's page again lists all the families living in the village since the Meiji period, and only 5 families were still living in Nashitani by 1982 (Showa 57). Those 5 families were Yamazaki, Higashi, Tsujimoto, Arai, and Nakai. The Arai family married into the Yamazaki family. There was also the maintained grave for the Uji family. They apparently only moved to Johana, a mere 10km away.</p><p>The Kuribayashi family, though... Murakage lists them as having moved to either Kyoto or Hokkaido in the 60s. I wonder who fixed up their home.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Those 5 main homes and the temple, plus a garage and a few other storage buildings were all that I could find in the area. Apparently, there's another home further up the Nashitani river.</p><p>Murakage-san visited Nashitani with another abandoned village researcher named <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123">Hayaneko</a>. He does a lot of research on these villages by looking up old schools, specifically branch schools. Branch schools are extensions of the main school in the area that cater specifically to the residents of remote villages. It's often too far and too dangerous to have the kids travel to school each day, so a local school would be built and a teacher would live at the school during the week or sometimes for the whole winter.</p><p>Out here, the school was named Taira Village Shimonashi Elementary School - Nashitani Branch School <span class='ja'>平村立下梨小学校梨谷分校</span>. According to his research, the school was classified as a Grade 3 Remote School and had 24 students in 1959 (Showa 34). It was apparently built in 1902 (Meiji 35). According ot Wikipedia, the branch school was officially closed in 1971. Apparently it was turned into a community center after it closed, but there doesn't seem to be any trace of it left.</p><p>Any elementary students left in the area went to Shimonashi Elementary School directly after the branch school closed, which became much easier with the completion of the Nashitani Tunnel in 1973. </p><p>Later in 1999, the two elementary schools in the area, Shimonashi Elementary and Higashi Nakae Elementary both closed when Taira Elementary School was established. Not much later, in 2004 during the phase of rural municipal mergers across Japan, the whole southwestern area of Toyama became Nanto City. In 2006, elementary school students now went to Kamitaira Elementary School,  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I feel like the graves and the temple are the most interesting part of this village. According to Google Maps, the name of the temple of the Nashitani Nembutsu Dojo <span class='ja'>梨谷念仏道場</span>. Apparently, Nembutsu is a specific sect of Buddhist spread a priest named Rennyo <span class='ja'>蓮如上人</span> who lived in the Gokayama mountains. He began preaching about Joho Shinshu during the Muromachi period and gained many followers in the mountains and in Nanto and Johana Towns.</p><p>During the Edo Period, he was able to build temples in many of the small mountain villages for the locals to practice the religion. The temples were apparently unique in that they were as large as a normal homes, and priests could live in them. Looking back through some names, the priest of Nashitani may have been named Anchi <span class='ja'>安地</span>.</p><p>Each one of the graves are nearly identical with the exception of the famliy's name. The top reads <span class='ja'>南無阿弥陀佛</span> or Namuamida Hotoke. Namuamida is Buddha. Hotoke, I think, means statue or monument. Maybe it doesn't mean grave after all...  But, I think these monuments were still erected to pay respects to the families of the past 200 years. Weird that I never saw the Yamazaki one.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While it does feel like the many pockets of society dotted throughout the Gokayama mountains have been slowly reclaimed by nature, I'm actually surprised how much information I could find out about this one. If I did more research, I wonder if I could find out more about the people who lived here, and what their modern-age descendants might be doing.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Abandoned Ueda Village 上田村" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/abandoned-ueda-village">Abandoned Ueda Village 上田村</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 28, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Old Ueda Village used to be a key destination on the old Gokayama Highway, leaving the urban area of Tonami City <span class='ja'>砺波町</span> and Johana Town <span class='ja'>城端町</span> and going up into the southwestern mountains of Toyama prefecture. After Ueda Village, there was nothing but the road, the trees, and the climb. Many of the residents made their living catering to these travelers, or by working as porters themselves.</p><p>At the top of the first mountain was <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span></a>, which I wrote about before. The Hosoo Pass and the area is well known for its Postal Corps, a group of housewives and local people employed by the postal service who would cross the mountain every day during winter to deliver the mail. When descending from the pass from the other side, you'd reach <a href="/old/v7/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="/abandoned-nashitani-village">Nashitani Village <span class='ja'>梨谷村</span></a> and then after going over Ose Pass, you'd reach Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> and Shinonashi Village <span class='ja'>下梨村</span>.</p><p>After the war, Japan began to rebuild and became an economic icon. They invested a lot of money into infrastructure, making many of the remote areas more accessible. The Gokayama Highway became Route 304, and as transportation also became stronger, fewer and fewer people were stopping at Ueda before going up the mountain. In 1970, a new Route 304 was established, and now no one traveled through Ueda.</p><p>In 1973, the remaining residents of the Ueda Village all moved away together to the Rikyu area of Johana Town, leaving what was left of their homes to be reclaimed by the forest.</p><p>In 2009, a monument was erected in remembrance of the old village. I put a <a href="/old/v7/ueda-village-translation" title="/ueda-village-translation">transcription and translation</a> of that monument in another post, so you can view the information directly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the village with its credits listed on the back of the monument. On the larger stone monument, a town map has been enshrined. It lists 35 households from 1945 (Showa 20). From research done <a href="/pages/murakage-ueda.html" title="/pages/murakage-ueda.html">Mr. Murakage on his site</a>, Ueda village had 30 homes with 174 people in 1872. The number of homes may have peaked in 1930 with 42 homes. As mentioned above, it was 35 homes in 1945. Murakage says 22 homes in 1946. And only 8 homes in 1948.</p><p>Apparently when Murakage and Hayaneko visited the area in 2011, there were still some wooden remains of a few houses. Today, I couldn't any trace of homes other than some stone foundations and a few bridges that crossed the steam and went no where.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking at the town map again, there are a lot of side roads branching off of old Route 304. The map shows a shrine off in a direction, so I wondered if there were still any traces of that left. Usually people still attend to shrines long after the area is desserted. (Of course, I wasn't able to sight-read the monument, so I didn't know the shrine had folded and its diety moved into town.)</p><p>Across the street from the monument, it did look like there was a path leading into the forest. It was heavily overgrown, but my legs were completely wrapped up and I had my work gloves. I could power through it if the path continued to be noticeable enough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tearing through vines and overgrowth wasn't that bad, and the path continued to lead to a raised clearing which must've been a foundation for a home. So, I figured that I must have been going the right way. Although, looking at the map, it was clearly not. The path to the shrine went up a bit, so I continued up, but the ground was too muddy and unstable. I stepped on the ground, and my foot sunk into a mud hole. Meh, I'm going back. It's probably better to try and run through the woods in fall after the growth has died down.</p><p>I got back in my car and continued driving south going up the mountain. Along the road were several dumping pits for concrete rubble. Further up the road was a construction site for machinery milling out parts of the mountain to create concrete and concrete blocks used for road construction and such.</p><p>The road twisted back on itself and sharply shot up the mountain to reach the current Route 304.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the top of the junction, you could look back down and see just how thick the forests were after so much rain and sun in May and June. Way up in the left corner of that photo, you can see <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span></a>, the ultimate destination of all the porters who lived in Ueda Village when they transported things to Gokayama. By continuing up the new Route 304 (new as of 1970), you'll reach the destination of the porters.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By the way, finding the Ueda (Futatsuya) Village monument took a little bit of research. I had found those webpages of <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko</a> and <a href="/pages/murakage-ueda.html" title="/pages/murakage-ueda.html">Mr. Murakage</a> going to the village in 2011, but it's not marked on the map, and both reports don't actually say where it is. I had a general idea where it was, though, given the location of Hosoo Pass. And just north of Hosoo Pass was Futatsuya River following north into Johana. It had to be along there, but I didn't really have confirmation.</p><p>What I was really looking for was the first image in <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko's Post</a>. There was an old road sign pointing to Ueda two kilometers ahead. This had to be somewhere in southern Johana. I poked around a lot Google Map Street View, and I finally found it. This is at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z" title="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z">36°29'03.5"N 136°53'32.4"E</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" /></a></p><p>Street View had an entry for 2021 and 2012, both of which had the sign removed from its posts. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.webp"/>When I arrived at the location</a>, the posts were no longer in the ground. There was some debris nearby, some piles of loose lumber, possibly from a demolished shed.

Interesting that those two of the three had been abandoned and decayed themselves.</p><p>After going through Ueda village and back up the mountain, my next location was another abandoned village, <a href="/old/v7/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="/abandoned-nashitani-village">Nashitani Village <span class='ja'>梨谷村</span></a>. Shimonashi was the main village along river, and Nashitani was futher up the mountain between Ose Pass and Hosoo Pass.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Iiyama Temple 飯山寺" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/iiyama-temple">Iiyama Temple 飯山寺</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's now all that remains of the Iiyama family and castle, which was said to be a psuedonymn of Asahina Saburou <span class='ja'>朝比奈三郎</span>.</p><p>I went to the area because I was looking around at locations of castle ruins in Takayama. I had never noticed this before, nor really knew anything about it. Also, Google Maps didn't even have a road going to it, so it seems like an interesting place to investigate.</p><p>To reach the temple, there's an unremarkable unpaved side road that goes up a hill through some farms. The farmland is still being used, so some rice planting equipment was on the side of the road. The narrow roads winds up the hill as most side roads do, and the forest opens up to reveal the temple and a rather large garden with some old folks doing their various gardening.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0213_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Being the height of June, all the plants and grass have grown to take over much of the area. There were several historical plaques posted near the temple with each more recent plaque having more detailed information of the history and significance of the temple. I made a separate post with full <a href="/old/v7/iiyama-temple-translations" title="/iiyama-temple-translations">transcriptions and translations</a> of those plaques.</p><p>The legend of the temple begins with Asahina Saburou, a legend of Japanese folklore. After his defeat in the Heiji Rebellion, he apparently fled to Hida and lived in hiding by changing his name to Iiyama. At this location, at the foot of the mountain, he built his castle and estate. Although, the plaque says that the rebellion was in 1159, but Wikipedia says Asahina was born in 1176, so who knows.</p><p>After building his estate, he ultimately came into possession of a statue of the eleven-headed Kannon. He built a hall within his estate to house and display the statue. This hall was named Reishoin <span class='ja'>霊松院</span>. The hall was later refashioned into a temple in 1339 for the statue.</p><p>Later, Miki Yoritsuna (1540-1587) invaded Hida and burned down Iiyama's castle and estate, along with the temple. Miki built <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">Matsukura Castle</a> on the top of that mountain to defend the region.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0257_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After the Kanamori Clan swept through Hida and conquered it, Kanamori <span class='ja'>金森長近</span> ordered a Shingon monk to rebuild the temple at its current location, which was said to be where Iiyama Castle and estate once stood. The temple was renamed Toukouzan Iiyama Temple <span class='ja'>東向山飯山寺</span>. This was in 1604.</p><p>In the Edo Period, with Tokugawa Shogunate in full control of Japan, a priest named Genkai <span class='ja'>玄海</span> began the revival of state sanctioned Buddhism. He moved to Takayama and lived in Iiyama Temple as he helped rebuild and shape Kokubunji Temple downtown. He also rebuilt Ichinomiya Shrine to the south. The Buddhism revival attracted many lords and people, so the temple flourished again. The current worship hall at Iiyama Temple was part of Ichinomiya Temple reconstruction, and later moved here.</p><p>Inside the temple, the wooden statue of the eleven-headed Kannon is still there, according to the plaque. All of the doors were closed, and the entrances were covered in screens for protection against animals. For a time, the temple was home to two works by the Japanese Monk, Enku <span class='ja'>円空</span>, both of which are designated as cultural properties of Gifu prefecture. Those works are now on display in the Takayama City Museum.</p><p>Despite the Temple having been largely abandoned, every seven years the temple opens again for the public to view the priceless statues inside. Although, apparently, this practice may have stopped in 2021.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0289_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Near the exit to the forest was a small collection of Ojizosama. It seemed like it had been several years since they've been tended to. One of the Jizos didn't even have a face anymore.</p><p>The Ojizosama statues offer two kinds of protection. One of these protections are for children who have died too early in life. As a child's soul passes into the afterlife, it doesn't have its parents to guide them. So, the Jizo-sama protect them like a parent.</p><p>These days, I think the more common protection of these statues is for travelers, which is why you see these statues everywhere when driving around in the mountains. The Jizo-sama protect people traveling long distances and help them reach their destination.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the hill, there are a few more statues and monuments, but many of them had been knocked over by snow melt. Now, they've become buried again from the high grass. Up on the hill behind the temple and behind the monuments was a cellphone tower. The cellphone tower seems like it gets more attention these days than the temple.</p><p>Upon entering and leaving the area, you pass by a small shrine on the side of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250622_iiyama/IMG_0342_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The stone sign next to it says it's the Iiyama Temple Children's Area <span class='ja'>飯山寺子供地域</span>. Back in the day, this might make sense as an area for the Temple's children to use while the adults perform the festival at the main temple. Nowadays, the road to the temple goes directly passed it, so it's only still here for preservation.</p><p>Again, the road leading to the temple is a fairly unremarkable side road off of Route 41. The side road used to be masked by a construction company and their large building, but I feel like they had been slowly going out of business over the last several years. Now, this main building has been completely demolished. Looking through Google, it must've happen in the last 6 months, which is really recent.</p><p>It's remarkable to go around Japan and find pockets of rich history. But, it's also almost just as remarkable how fast they can tear down their modern buildings when their business moves or changes. Living in Takayama for over 12 years, there have been so many changes.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
