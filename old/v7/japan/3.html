I made a set of reservations for us, but it was pretty empty during our time.</p><p>The Square Enix Cafe runs monthly themes based on Square-Enix games. Our theme was the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters, which worked perfectly for us. We all played the old games back in the day, but I don't think all of us have really kept up with their recent releases.</p><p>We were sat next to the Final Fantasy VI statue, which retails at over $10,000.

| November 4, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Fukuji-yama is a mountain in the eastern country of Takayama. It is overshadowed by many of the other great mountains in the area, but still a great morning climb for those staying in the Hida-yuu area. I had this mountain on my list of places to climb for years, and with recent motivation, I decided to finally tackle it.</p><div class='title'><b>Fukuji Onsen Morning Market <span class='ja'>福地温泉朝市</span></b></div><p>One of the big reasons for my visit was the morning market in the neighborhood at the base of the hike.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6525_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The morning market worked as a convenient store, a souvenir shop, and a retro museum all in one. The outside of the building was covered with old advertisements from the 60s. Inside, the walls and ceiling were covered with records and posters of idols and musicians from the 70s and 80s. The whole building was a time capsule of when Japan was rich and everyone enjoyed their music.</p><p>The market sold older classic toys, like Kendama, and had plenty of Hida souvenirs, too. I only bought a bottle of water and a map of the hike.</p><div class='title'><b>Hike</b></div><p>With all my items packed in my bag, I began the hike. The whole area of Fukuji and Hida-yuu is in a very deep valley. Once you got to the edge of the valley, the hike up the mountain was almost complete vertical. The hiking snaked back and forth, back and forth up the mountain-side, surrounded by equally vertically trees shielding you from the sky.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6561_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Obviously mountain hiking has a lot of vertical ascents, but I wasn't really prepared for how continuous this was. It was like a stair climb. I eventually caught up with another couple of hikers. They were from Montana and staying in Hida-yuu for the night. They thought they would do a quick morning hike before their bus at noon, but were also surprised with how rough the hike had been.</p><p>Additionally, often the hiking trail would be obscured. It was hard to tell where the trail headed compared with the surrounding ground. At one point, I went straight up, not realizing the trail was meant to snake around and come back to where I was.</p><p>The maps where also inaccurate.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6523_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I took a photo of the map at the base of the hike, and was using that to figure out where I was and where I was going. All the distances are wrong. On the map, the start of the hike to the first branch point looks about the same distance from the branch point to the teacher statue, marked as <span class='ja'>石像</span> on the map. In reality, it took about 45 minutes to climb the mountain to reach the branch point, and only 15 minutes more to reach the statue.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6599_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The text reads <span class='ja'>篠原無然之像</span>, or Statue of Shinohara Mugen, and it was erected in May 1921 or Taishi 10 <span class='ja'>大正</span>10<span class='ja'>年</span>, as written on the statue. Shinohara Mugen was a man was loved nature and often hiked the mountains of Hida-yuu. With his hikes, he educated people about the trees, flowers, and plants that grew on the mountain. Because of this, after he passed, his students made this statue of him.</p><p>I was already an hour into the hike, and according to the map I was only a third done with the hike. I continued on. 30 minutes later, I reached viewpoint #2 <span class='ja'>第二展望台</span> as written on the map. Another time/distance that did not make sense to the scale of the map. The Montana couple I was with decided to give up, thinking that there was no way they'd be able to make it to the summit and back done in time for their bus.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6643_t.webp" /></a></p><p>15 minutes later, I reached viewpoint #4 <span class='ja'>第二展望台</span>. Again, on the map, it was same distance as the previous 30 minutes and same distance as the original 45 minutes. Thank god for these actual markers or else I would have no idea where I actually was.</p><p>Another short 10 minutes, and I made it to the summit in a total of around 2 hours.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6661_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Perhaps the funniest thing of the whole hike was that the view wasn't really all that great. It gave a great view of Tochio village leading into the Shinhotaka ropeway, but all the mountains were obscured by the clouds. Usually when there's a deep fog in Takayama in the morning, the sky above the fog is totally clear and by Noon everything goes away.</p><p>Not today, though. Sometimes the mountains make their own weather, and Fukuji-yama was a mountain much deeper into the country compared with Takayama's immedate surrounding mountains.</p><p>I took some photos and then started back down the mountains. Now knowing where to go and what paths to take and also not stopping so often for photos, I made it back down the mountain in only an hour compared to the two hours it took to climb.</p><div class='title'><b>Ramen</b></div><p>I don't often find myself in the eastern areas of Takayama. But, when I'm there and I have time and I'm hungry, I visit my favorite Ramen restaurant in Takayama.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6725_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's called Shonyudou <span class='ja'>鍾乳堂</span>, and it's the main restaurant in front of the Limestone cave in Nyukawa. They make the absolute best Okuhida Ramen. Takayama Ramen ends up getting a lot of praise, but the noodles are too stringy and the broth is too thin. Okuhida Ramen is thicker in both categories and has slices of ham, too. It's so good.</p><p>I'm not sure how many tourists they're able to get. But, it always seems like there's a local family or two in the restaurant. I'm glad they're still able to keep business after all these years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231102_fukuji/IMG_6731_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>Overall, I think I enjoyed the hike.

There are only 4 colors, too, so that's also a problem.  But, as long as I'm able to prop the camera up against the glass or some solid surface, it's stable enough to take a photo without blur. Above is a stitched together image from 4 shots.</p><p>Mt. Ontake and Mt. Norikura to the north were clearly visible, too. It's pretty amazing how far you're able to see when the weather is so clear.  Mt. Norikura is the eastern-most mountain in Takayama that borders Nagano. Takayama is about 80km north from the Twin Arch, and Norikura is about 50km directly east from there.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="columnTwo"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Mt.

The view is amazing, especially on such a great day, but there isn't really a whole lot to see. There's the ferris wheel to the north next to the aquarium, but that's really the closest thing.

I'm using the GameBoy Camera Plus mod created by 2BitToy, which takes the inner circuits from a GameBoy Camera and puts them into a new shell with a CS Mount lens adapter.

I'm using my Analogue Pocket to run it.</p><p>Also in the observation deck is a small cafe. Its signature dish was called Honey Toast.

It is one of the tallest mountains in the area at 1596 meters, and on a clear day, you'd be able to view both Toyama and Takayama cities from the top.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I had a friend coming to visit who was interested in doing a million things, and I had this mountain marked on my map from a while ago. So, we decided to take a look!</p><p>The pin on my map was for a parking lot pretty close to the peak, but after searching for hiking paths and current conditions, the Hida wilderness website marked the road closed due to a landslide. There's a hiking website (<a href="https://yamap.com/" title="https://yamap.com/">yamap.com</a>) where people record their hikes, and the most recent hikes of the mountain seemed to confirm it. </p><p>Using yamap as a guide, there were several places where we could start our hike, but ultimately we planned on starting at the campground where the road had been closed and going from there. Hikes on yamap confirmed this was possible.</p><div class='title'><b>The Climb</b></div><p>It took way longer to get to the campground than I had expected. We left a little later than planned, but the winding roads made us move very slowly.  Google Maps said it would only take an hour from my apartment. I think we left around 8:15am and finally made it to the campground at 10:05am. Even though we made two quick stops along the way, it took nearly 2 hours.</p><p>The campground was a nice piece of civilization carved out of the heavy thicket of trees and bushes. There was even a museum, or some kind of cultural hall, that detailed the surrounding nature. We didn't have time for it, though, and went straight on the path forward up the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The path itself was just the closed road, so it was pretty easy. We walked passed several dammed and relegated streams coming from above. Some of the cement structures lower in the streams had been eroded away.</p><p>The climb was steady and kept going and going. It wasn't long before we could see some of the height we had already traveled.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>45 minutes later, we hit the detour.  We had known that the road was closed due to a landslide, and the sign directed us to take this trail instead. It indicated that it led to the summit, and another hiker of their way down informed us that this was the way to go.  So we went.</p><p>Looking at Google Maps, it seems like the trail was about 600 meters.  Certainly not as long as the 3km we had already walked. However, our gradual 20 degree incline significantly spiked to 45 degrees, or more. The course had ropes to help pull ourselves up the climb, but it was still pretty rough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As in any marathon, you continue to push through and continue to move. The longer you stop, the longer it takes. But, my partner in climb doesn't do marathons, so we often took some breaks, which ended up being necessary. This trail completely exhausted my supply of water.</p><p>Another 45 minutes later, we reached the trail head and made it back to paved road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having gained some significant height, and as the paved road winded around the mountain to gain height, we often had a view that looked down on the path we've traveled. Just 10 minutes later, the top of the trail head looked so small and far away. Another 20 minutes later, even further. One of the best parts about this hike we being able to visually observe the distance we had traveled. We wouldn't have gotten this experience by simply driving to the top. On the other hand, we wouldn't have been dying of thirst and exhaustion either.</p><p>After 30 minutes, we reached the upper parking area at 12:15pm. There was no running water, but there were some jugs of water as to use as an emergency. It did not look safe, so we moved onward and upward. Often there were trails that appeared on the side the road that offered us a shorter path to the top. But, we had already experienced the cost of such shortcuts from the detour earlier, so we continued on the road.</p><p>45 minutes later, the emergency shelter came in view. We climbed up to it and took a break inside. Nearly to the top!</p><p>Outside of the shelter gave us our first grand view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think we stopped for about 10 minutes, and continued along the wooden path. Some of the path had degraded, and other parts were washed away from rain. The path looked like it went back down the other side of the mountain, which we didn't want to do. But, I scouted ahead and the path only dipped a little bit.</p><p>Around the corner, the path connected with the ridge line path. Going to the right, it lead to the peak.</p><div class='title'><b>Summit <span class='ja'>山頂</span></b></div><p>After nearly 3 hours of walking and hiking, and a total of around 8 or 9 kilometers, we had made it to the top. From the top, we had a 360-degree view of everything around us. The east (first panoramic photo below), the north (second), and the south and west (third).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The weather was pretty warm with only a few clouds when we started. But, there was a strong wind at the top. The wind had pulled in the clouds (and later on rain), so a lot of the view was covered. We could still see Toyama to the north, though not a lot of detail. To the south, we saw an area that had to be Takayama. We couldn't confirm it, but it couldn't have been anything else.</p><p>It wasn't really cold up there, but the wind was pretty strong. My hat blew clear off my head!</p><p>To the south-west was a Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span>, a small buddhist shrine. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I wonder how many buddhist monks hike the mountain to pray here.</p><p>The other notable location at the peak is a pond to the east. The trail maps said it would take about 25 minutes to get there (and another 25 minutes to get back), but looking at the time, we could not afford to go. We needed to get out of the mountains by sundown (5pm-ish), and we were getting close to that limit with the amount of time it would take to descend.</p><div class='title'><b>Descent</b></div><p>We left the summit before 2pm and took the paved road all the way down. At the top, the paved road began on a disheveled cracked helicopter pad. Moving down the road, some of it had been completely broken apart and ground into rock, but I think a car could still drive across it.</p><p>Turns out, going down the mountain is way more easy than going up. After about an hour, we made it back to the trail head for the detour. We decided to stay on the road this time, and go through construction. We knew how steep and hard the trail would be, and the construction and landslide couldn't be THAT bad.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Turns out, we were right. The construction and road repair was already complete. If the gate had been opened at the campsite, we could've driven this whole distance. The construction sign we found a little bit later indicated that the road would be open on October 20th, so maybe they still needed to test their repair, or something.</p><p>This road led off in the opposite direction before meeting back to where the detour began. Going down, it took us 45 minutes from where the trail head ended to where it began. This was the same time it took us to climb up.</p><p>Because it went off into another part of the mountain, I started noticing a lot of vines choking and strangling the trees and brush on the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was so thick. Nothing our size would be able to move through it. Everything was covered with this vine. My friend mentioned that it was probably all one organism, too, that just continued to grow and grow.</p><p>Eventually we made it through the thicket. We reached the start of the trail head and made it to camp, a bit further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going down the mountain is a bit easier, but the constant stamping of feet on pavement takes it toll on the soles of feet and the hip. But! We arrived and were finally able to refill our water. Another hour of driving through the windy roads, and we were back to civilization.</p><p>It had a been a while since I had been on a hike, and this one turned into one of the longest hikes I've done in Hida. Much like a marathon, you often question why you ever decided to do it not long after beginning. But you move past that feeling and start enjoying the moment, the movement, the nature, and accomplishment. I need to do some more hiking.</p><p>Overall, this was a great hike, even though a bit rough. This would be excellent to do again with absolutely clear weather.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><table><tr><td>9:27am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Sugadaira Campground <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平キャンプ場</span> </td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (construction)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>End of Trail</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:00pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Emergency Shelter <span class='ja'>避難小屋</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692">36°25'02.1"N 137°06'42.1"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Summit <span class='ja'>白木峰山頂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222">36°24'56.1"N 137°06'44.0"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897">36°24'50.8"N 137°06'39.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:25pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (end) - skipped, took road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>3:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (start)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to car (Sugadaira Camp) <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:55pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>5:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kawai <span class='ja'>河合</span> 471 Interchange</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159">36°18'23.0"N 137°05'31.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wind Castle 風の城" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wind-castle">Wind Castle 風の城</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The military commander at the time was under the command of the ruler of the Hida region to the south. Hida is surrounded by mountains, so there are very few ways of getting up there. This castle was built to monitor any large armies that may be headed up the mountain to attack.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>This path can be clearly seen today in the above panoramic. There's an incredible clear view of Hwy 41 coming down from Hida. </p><p>It still completely baffles me that I never noticed this place before. Although, I think it's easy to see why I hadn't noticed it before. On my way back home up to Hida, I took some reverse photos looking back at the mountain and the castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The white castle blends into the sky very easily. If you didn't know it was there, you would never notice it. But, once you know that it's there and where to look, it pops out.</p><p>There's also not a whole lot of information about the Wind Castle online. In fact, my friend and I only found this thing by skimming around Toyama in Google Maps looking for something to do. I wanted to know exactly when they built this thing, and its purpose. </p><p>There's a plaque on the Wind Caste which states the following: <br/><b><span class='ja'>平成</span>2<span class='ja'>年度</span></b> <I>Heisei-2 (or 1990)</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>中部通商産業局</span> <span class='ja'>地域エネルギー開発利用発電モデル事業</span></b> <I>Chubu Bureau of International Trade and Industry Regional Energy Development Utilization Power Generation Model Project</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>「風の城</span> <span class='ja'>風力エネルギー開発利用事業」</span></b><I>"The Wind Castle - Wind Energy Development Utilization Project"</I><br/><b>-<span class='ja'>富山県大沢野町</span></b> <I>- Osawano Town, Toyama Prefecture.</I></p><p>Quite a mouthful. Seems like it was built in 1990, although I wanted to find more substantial information online. Eventually I did find a blog post of someone talking about Sarukura castle (explained earlier), and a few other things. In particular, in 1975, as part of Toyama prefecture's 100th year anniversary, a 9.6km trail was opened from Mt. Sarukura to Mt. Kosami Gozen <span class='ja'>小佐波御前山</span>. It didn't mention anything about the Wind Castle at that time. </p><p>I didn't find anything that confirmed its opening in 1990. But, it was probably built in 1990 as its architecture and flashy nature seems to fit that time well. Like everything built during the economic high times of the 80s and 90s in Japan, it is definitely showing wear and tear from the years. Some of the windows have been kicked out, and the metal railing has graffiti almost everywhere. One of the door had been kicked in, too.</p><p>If you've never been, I would absolutely recommend driving up here if you're going to or from Toyama. I will probably return here each time I visit Toyama now. Different weather, different season, and different time of day will all create a new view. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nishi-cho-taiki">Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been out of the ramen game a little while, and also Takayama's ramen has very thin noodles and thin broth. The standard size is pretty much the perfect amount of ramen.  Yet, they also offered sizes that were 1.5 times and double the standard.  I don't know how anyone could eat those.</p><p>With all the onions and pepper, the ramen had a somewhat hidden, gradually building, and lingering spiciness to it, which was very unique. I always consume everything I order, so I always eat/drink the broth, which is not the Japanese norm. The broth was very dark with the amount of soy-sauce infused in it. Ramen isn't the most healthy food to begin with, but with the amount of soy-sauce included, I would not recommend eating/drinking all of it, like I had. With the amount of onions and pepper in there, too, I needed a lot more water than what they provided.</p><p>Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Black Ramen.

| August 11, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Takayama is a city surrounded by mountains and nature. These mountains lead to excellent vantage points of the city, but all have their own history, too. The southwest mountains of Matsukura <span class='ja'>松倉</span> and Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span> used to be the center point of the ruling class of the town.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></b></div><p>Back in the 1500s, Hida was its own province amongst the warring states, and the rulers were the Anekouji Clan <span class='ja'>姉小路</span>. Takayama was the most prosperous area of Hida because it was the most open. Farmers could easily till the land and feed all of its people. There was plenty of roam to rear livestock, such as horses and cows. And, Hida was also known for its expert carpenters. The mountain of Matsukura overlooked the entirety of Takayama, so it was the perfect point to build a stronghold to defend the city. This was Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span>.</p><p>Towards the end of the 1500s, Oda Nobunaga <span class='ja'>織田信長</span> had begun his conquest of defeating all independent clan and armies and unifying Japan as a single country. In 1585, he dispatched Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span> to ascend the mountains of Hida and destroy the Anekouji Clan to claim the territory. The Anekouji Clan was easily outmatched, defeated, and killed.</p><p>With Hida and Takayama under the control of Nobunaga through Kanamori, peace came to the city, and Kanamori transformed the city into a vacation town for his rich friends. He built a new lavish castle, the Takayama Castle, closer to the center of town, and left Matsukura to rot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, Matsukura Castle is a complete ruin, and even those ruins fall further and further apart with each year. <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">9 years ago</a>, I traveled up to the top for the first time, and I did it again <a href="/old/v7/harayama-in-winter" title="/harayama-in-winter">a few months later</a> to compare the seasons.

Can you find these locations, too?</p><p>With both views from Matsukura and Harayama combined, you're able to see about 65% of Takayama. The southern neighborhoods are obstructed by trees, and the eastern neighborhoods are behind the short mountains that cut through downtown.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Kannon <span class='ja'>松倉観音</span></b></div><p>Again, in 1585, the Kanamori clan, led by Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, took control of the Hida province and stationed themselves in Takayama.  After 108 years and 5 generations, Kanamori Yoritoki <span class='ja'>金森頼旹</span> was the current head of the clan. He was a troublesome child and leader, so the entire clan was removed from the Hida province in 1692 and transferred to modern day Yamagata.</p><p>At the same time, a buddhist monk named Tenden Koutou <span class='ja'>天電高幢</span> returned from his position at the Sennyu-ji Temple <span class='ja'>泉涌寺</span> in Kyoto, and built a shrine to Kannon in a cave of Matsukura mountain. This shrine is called a Fumonin <span class='ja'>普門院</span>, an official branch of temples across Japan that pray to the buddhist God, Kannon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Kannon is a deity in Buddhism that grants people deliverance from suffering. People will often pray to Kannon for protection from illness and prosperity for their family and livelihood. Kannon has six transformations, and the Matsukura Kannon Temple specifically prays to the Bato Kannon transformation.</p><p>Bato Kannon is the more violent and warlike transformation, characterized by a menacing horse head. Horses were a very important animal and symbol of old Hida. There were used for farming, transportation, and many people considered them members of their family. People from Hida and even further would travel with their horses to the temple on July 9th every year, to pray for the wellbeing and protection of their horses.</p><div class='title'><b>Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> and Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span></b></div><p>Traveling up the mountain isn't so difficult today, but this was not the case 400 years ago. It caused a lot of stress for the horse. So, artists began painting horses on paper and selling them in downtown Takayama. These horse paintings were called Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span>, which literally translates to Horse Painting. Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span> means Horse Painting Market.</p><p>At this market, farmers would buy whichever horse painting they thought looked most like their horse. Then, they would bring this painting up the mountain to the Matsukura temple instead of their actual horse.</p><p>Over time, this painted horse became a symbol for more than just their horse. Because a family would rely on their horse for their farm, the horse painting now encompassed a person's entire farm or business. Families also consider their horse a member of their family, so the horse painting protection began to expand to other members of the family, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Modern Day Emaichi</b></div><p>These days, the tradition continues. Almost every business throughout Hida (and most residences, too) will have a horse painting at the entrance. Pointed inward, the horse painting offers protection and prosperity for the business or family inside.</p><p>Every year on August 9th and 10th, the Bato Kannon deity is moved from the main Kannon temple in downtown Takayama into the Matsukura mountain. At this time, horse paintings are created for anyone that comes to visit and a Buddhist monk of the Kannon temple will infuse his prayer into the painting.</p><p><a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">8 years ago</a>, I came here for the first time after finally learning about the origins of the horse paintings that I saw everywhere. People get a fresh horse painting every year to renew their protection and luck, but I think it worked out pretty well for me.</p><p>This year was the first time the Emaichi was held in person since Covid.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I visited the temple during the day to get some order forms.

Retro museums focus on the era of economic revival of post-war Japan and all of the culture that came from it. Most items are from the 1950s and 1960s. But lately, some of these museums have added things from the 70s and 80s, sometimes even 90s.</p><p>I love retro museums because it's all history that our modern culture and society have been built upon. You could say that all history has built our modern lives, but recent history of 50 to 60 years is so close that you can easily make those connections to modern day and see how things have changed from not that long ago.</p><p>Showa Hall was one of the first touristy places I visited in Takayama when I first arrived 10 years ago, and I fell in love with the idea of retro museums. Last week, we had a field trip at school where we walked around town and viewed the town like a tourist, so I returned.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp"/></a></p><p>While Takayama has changed quite a bit in the 10 years I've lived here, the Showa Hall remains almost identical.

The Showa era ended in 1989 and ushered in the Heisei era.  But the 90s are Retro, so it still somewhat makes sense.  Maybe some of the J-pop records from the music store downstairs were already walking that fine line.</p><p>As mentioned above, I love Retro Showa-era Museums because the history is so close. But it's still history that I never actually lived, so even though it was near history, it was still distant.  The 90s are WAY different because not only had I lived through them before, they're only 30 years ago.</p><p>Also mentioned above, I revisited the Showa Hall during a school field trip, so they were many students in the museum at the same time, and I was with some teachers, too. One teacher is getting pretty close to 60-years-old, so he lived through the era with many of the items in the museum. He commented how he his school classroom looked identical to the one in the museum, and how he had memorized most of the music in the store from hearing it so many times.  His reaction was much more of a nostalgia trip than a "ugh I'm getting old" feeling.</p><p>Also, the 90s gaming stuff is really just tacked on. They aren't trying to recreate a 90s gaming room. They're just displaying a bunch of games and have the mini consoles up. Really low effort. You can get the exact same experience by going to any used game store. Maybe this better explains my apprehension of their 90s gaming display.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Showa Hall is still one of my favorite places in Takayama. Another Retro Museum had also opened in the last 10 years, but it's much more of a circus rather than a caringly curated collection and recreation of the times. I would recommend visiting if you ever come to Takayama. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gifu Retro Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gifu-retro-museum">Gifu Retro Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 15, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Japan is a country rich in history, and a country that is rich in history is also rich in museums. There are many national and prefectural museums that focus on the history of Japan both for culture and art. However, almost all of these museums focus on periods of Japan up through the Meiji era (through 1912) and World War II. Very few focus on the development of Japan after.</p><p>To pick up the slack, there are many independent <b>Retro</b> museums that can be found in small towns and resort towns. Owners of these museums curate their personal collections of 50-60 year old technology and memorabilia. Most of these gathered from friends or business upgrading their old stuff.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp"></a></p><p>The <b>Gifu Retro Museum</b> is a little different than other retro museum I've been to before. It does curate stuff from the past, but it would be more accurate to call this a Retro Amusement Center. The entry fee is timed, rather than a flat fee.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><u>Adults to Junior High students</u><br/>One hour is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 3000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column"><u> Elementary school students </u><br/>One hour is 500<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 1300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><u>Children ages 4 to 6 years old</u><br/>One hour is 300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 800<span class='ja'>円</span></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The "museum" is divided into three distinct separate rooms, each with their own distinctive feel and purpose. I'm sure that the entry pass is required for all three areas. The three rooms are the main room in the middle, which has snacks and arcade machines, the pachinko room on the right, and the food lounge to the left. </p><div class='title'><b>Main Room</b></div><p>When you enter the middle room, there are old posters and knick knacks pinned to the wall and sitting on old arcade machines and soda machines. When you exit the immediate entrance area, you exit an old style candy shop with lots of sweets and candy for sale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>A few arcade games and several amusement games are fit against the walls where there is space. There is a wack-a-mole game and racing game that probably distributed tickets back in the day. There's a flag game, where the characters tell you to raise or lower flags. There's also a Janken game where you deposit some amount of coin medals. If you win, a roulette will spin and its possible to get 20 times your coins back.</p><p>For Arcade machines, they had an After Burner and Super Hang-on machine. They had a Neo Geo switcher with a few games installed. A cocktail Nintendo VS cabinet, with Super Mario Bros, Mario Bros, and a few others. They had a cabinet with Darkstalkers currently installed. (Curious if they had any other CPS2 games in the back.)</p><p>With the entry paid for time, all arcade games were set to Free Play. So, you could do whatever you like. I played the Flag game for a little bit, trying to quickly understand the Japanese, and I played the Janken game too. The Janken game would be a really fun programming project if I get the chance to learn FPGA programming.</p><div class='title'><b>Pachinko Room</b></div><p>The Main Room leads into the Pachinko room, which is also accessible from the outside. This seems to be the main draw for people to come here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp"/></a></p><p>The Pachinko room has two rows full of machines from the late 80s and early 90s. They probably rescued this from an old Pachinko parlor that was getting demolished. All machines work and already had a few people on them right as the museum opened in the morning.</p><p>I wasn't exactly sure how the room was supposed to work. In a real pachinko parlor, you buy your balls and go to town on a machine. But, I wasn't sure if you still bought balls even after paying the entry fee, or if you could just grab a tray and mess around? Bleh, I really should've asked, but I was already self-conscious enough with the clerks constantly watching me take photos.</p><p>This seems like a pretty good activity for the elderly people living in the town. Rather than have them blow tons of money at a real pachinko parlor, they could pay $30 to sit in here all day. They could play the pachinko games they may have played years ago, and try to beat each other's high scores. It would be an amazing place to have a pachinko tournament, too.</p><p>I would imagine you could use the balls for free because if you actually had to pay for the balls, then they would have to pay out if you actually won a lot.</p><div class='title'><b>Food Area</b></div><p>The third area to the right of the entrance is the food area where they have collected several vintage vending machines.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp"/></a></p><p>There were some vending machine that gave out ice cream and burgers, but many of them sold noodles. I think they were all in working order, but I didn't try any of them out. It was still early in the morning, and I had lunch plans for later.</p><p>The best part of this room was the Mac and Me banner advertising the home video release.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>I think if you plan on playing vintage Pachinko for a few hours, it would be worth the visit. But otherwise, there were too few arcade games to make it worthwhile and there really weren't that many knick knacks to consider it a true retro museum. It's a bit expensive, too, so I wouldn't really recommend it.</p><p>The <b>Gifu Retro Museum</b> is located in Yamagata City, north of Gifu. Here's the location in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7" title="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7">Google Maps</a>. The parking lot is behind the building, which can be difficult to understand when you first arrive.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pocket Camera with Zoom Lens" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens">Pocket Camera with Zoom Lens</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 13, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Recently I finished putting together the Pocket Camera Plus for the Gameboy. This takes all of the original hardware of the GameBoy Camera and puts it into a shell that you can attach actual Camera lens. You can read more about here: <a href="/old/v7/gameboy-camera-plus" title="/gameboy-camera-plus">/gameboy-camera-plus</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" /></p><p>Attached to the Pocket Camera Plus, I'm using a pretty generic and bare bones Zoom lens. I just bought whatever was cheapest on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">Amazon</a>. It has manually focus, zoom, and aperture, and has a focus length of 6mm up to 60mm. I guess that means it has a 10x zoom. Each of the rings has a pin used for movement, but these pins can be screwed in to keep the current setting.</p><p>In addition to the manual settings of the lens, the GameBoy Camera game has a Contrast and Brightness setting. Contrast is very important to reduce the harsh lights and darks coming into the camera. There is some automatic brightness control that the camera already does. This makes the manual aperture nearly useless. And even the digital brightness settings in the game can get overridden by the software trying to autocorrect the brightness.</p><p>For the following photos, I really only used the manual Zoom and Focus, and digital Contrast when taking photos.</p><p>Anyway, with my Pocket Camera and regular Camera, I went around town throughout the weekend and tested it out.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakurano Park <span class='ja'>桜野公園</span></b></div><p>It's Spring in Takayama, so the Cherry Blossoms are in full boom. One of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Takayama is northwest of the main town. On the way to Kokufu, Sakurano Park is off to the side of the highway on the other side of the river. It's the perfect place to have a picnic on a warm Spring afternoon while viewing the cherry blossoms. (Although, this Spring has been freezing with the occasional snow)</p><p>I took some photos in late evening as the sun was setting.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div

incredible amount of flexibility when taking photos.
