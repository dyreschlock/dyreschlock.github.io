Often museums and other exhibits will use replicas or recreations of the original armor. The owner of this collection only collects and restores original pieces from the Battle of Sekigahara and the Sengoku period in general. Several of the pieces were owned by major lords in the battle, but not necessrily worn in the battle itself. Many of the other pieces were worn by soldiers in the battle, some of which were killed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The museum is just north of the main Battle of Sekigahara museum, and currently only takes reservations to view the collection. I emailed the owner the day before visiting, and he replied later in the evening saying I was all set to visit.</p><p>Viewing the collection is 800<span class='ja'>円</span>, but you could pay more for detailed lectures about each of his pieces and also try on some armor, if you're small enough. There's also an attached shop with some exclusive Sekigahara merch, and a small restaurant where the family will cook an "authentic" samurai meal for you. They also have a pet duck. :)</p><p>I was only interested in the armor for this visit, but next time I think I'll go for the lectural experience.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Immediately to the right after reception were 9 sets of armor, mostly consisting of foot soldiers. I'm not sure if any of these were used in the Battle of Sekigahara. In fact, the emblem above the middle set of armor is of the Fujiwara clan, which never participated in the battle.</p><p>The Fujiwara clan rose to power in the 800s, but another 800 years later at the time of the Battle, I think the clan had mostly been divided and renamed into other factions and eventually bred out of existance. One of their military branches was renamed the Monnashi clan, which did participate in the battle within Tokugawa's Eastern Army.</p><p>The flags in the back have the Ishida emblem on them, and the front foot soldier helmets have <span class='ja'>石</span> ishi written on them, so maybe those are some of Ishida's men? Although, they fought for the Western Army. Somewhat confusing.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Displayed on tables on the sides of the entrance were assorted pieces of armor used in the battle.

He said it was alright if I took some photos, but his workshop with armor currently being restored was off limits.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the first sections was devoted to <b>Ukita</b> Hideie <span class='ja'>宇喜多秀家</span> and his army. The main armor in the back was samurai armor owned by the Ukita clan at the time of the Battle. It's most likely not the armor he wore in the Battle, but it was armor he owned at that time. In the front are two sets of army from soldiers in his army. They are distinctly recognizable because of the Ukita clan emblems.</p><p>Ukita was one of the members of the Council of Five Regeants after Toyotomi passed away. He was very close to Toyotomi, so it was natural that he sided with Ishida against Tokugawa. One year after Toyotomi's death, there was an internal rebellion in the Ukita clan which resulted in several key members leaving to join Tokugawa. His army was slightly diminished but was still the largest army within the overall Western Army.</p><p>He survived the Battle of Sekigahara, although most of his army did not. He went into hiding, but was eventually captured and exiled to Hachijo-jima, a tiny volcanic island in the middle of the Pacific.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Next is armor previously owned by the Otani clan. <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span> was a close friend of Ishida. He was also fiercely loyal and honorable. Despite being inflicted with harsh illness which blinded him, he still brought his army to Sekigahara to fight with Ishida against Tokugawa.</p><p>Unfortunately, his army was completely overrun when Kobayakawa defected to the Eastern Army in the middle of  battle and attacked his army. They were completely overwhelmed, and thus, Otani committed seppuku to avoid capture and also to show his loyalty to the Western Army. His retainers took and hid his head and armor, so the Eastern Army could not have the satisfcation of his defeat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The above armor belonged to the Maeda family. <b>Maeda</b> Toshiie <span class='ja'>前田利家</span> was appointed as one of the Five Regeants after Toyotomi's death. Unfortunately, Maeda was also not in the best of health and died a year later. His son, Maeda Toshinaga <span class='ja'>前田利長</span> succeded him, but fell into a political trap set by Tokugawa. As such, Maeda could not stand against Tokugawa and he fought for the Eastern Army.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Next is armor from the Mori clan. <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span> was also one of the Five Regeants and pledged his support with Ishida in the Western Army. Mori's army was stationed in the east of the battlefield, and meant to swoop in behind Tokugawa's army and pincer them. However, when he was signaled to attack, he did nothing. After seeing the tide of battle shift heavily against the Western Army, he refused to attack and stayed neutral, sparing his men.</p><p>He political standing was diminished after the battle by 75%, but faithfully assisted the Tokugawa Shogunate years after the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Next, we have armor of the Shimidzu clan. <b>Shimadzu</b> Yoshihiro <span class='ja'>島津義弘</span> and nephew <b>Shimadzu</b> Toyohisa <span class='ja'>島津豊久</span> were leaders who supported the Western Army. Their numbers were few, but had a fierce honorable spirit. After the battle had been lost, they refused to turn their backs to the enemy. In order to retreat, they ran a final assault on the front lines of the Eastern Army, breaking through, and continuing to escape to the south. Nephew Toyohisa did not survive the escape.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>There were more pieces of armor at the end of the room, but I have trouble identifying which armies they belong to. Some of the armor is pretty distinct, but there really isn't an easy guide to follow for identifying them. I should've taken notes or asked the owner about them, but I hadn't researched anything before visiting.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These last sets of armor were back near the entrance of the room. I think he mentioned that all of these armor belonged to members of the Tokugawa clan, which makes sense given the above emblem. <b>Tokugawa</b> Ieyasu <span class='ja'>徳川家康</span> was one of the members of the Five Regeants and the key agitator which led to the Battle of Sekigahara.</p><p>While TV shows and history sometimes paint him as a glorious unifier of Japan, he is incredibly cold, manipulative, and constantly schemes against his rivals. Immediately after Toyotomi's death, he began scheming a series of marriage pacts to increase his standing, something which was strictly forbidden by Toyotomi. He used other political schemes to blackmail other lords into fighting for him. Any opportunity to increase his standing or decrease the standing of another was immediately taken.</p><p>While it seemed like many people hated the outspoken, garish attitude of Ishida, they hated Tokugawa more. Ishida went to war with Tokugawa to preserve the ideals set forth by Toyotomi. Everyone loyal to the deceased unifier of Japan held their ground, but were ultimately overpowered by Tokugawa's influence and strength.</p><p>After the battle, everyone loyal to Toyotomi was either executed, exiled, or significantly diminished. With full control of the government, Tokugawa banned weapons, shut down the country, and put to death anyone who would continue to oppose him.</p><p>On one hand, he was a harsh dictator that people secretly hated and feared. On the other hand, his rule set Japan on a course of extreme prosperity the country had never seen before. The population exploded, literacy exploded, and culture exploded. Japan became a modern beacon of the world, which became quite popular in Europe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having better knowledge of the battle and those involved, next time I go back to the museum, I'll have a better idea of what to ask about the armor and be in a better place to take notes.</p><p>The museum itself is really small.

You can pay to wear some goofy samurai armor for 20 or 30 minutes, walk around the area, and pose for photos. Much of this armor is pretty generic, with various clan emblems on them.</p><p>In the back of the Exchange Center, they had some premium costumes and authetic armor on display. Some of the armor was used in ceremonies and festivals in Sekigahara. The more authetic-looking armor were used in reenactments of the Battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3367_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The above armor is a costume of what was worn by <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span>, one of the close friends of Ishida Mitsunari, leader of the Western Army. The armor is very distinct as it has no helmet. The cloth was used to cover his disfigured face.</p><p>Otani's forces were positioned in the western forest. At the time of the battle, he was inflicted with severe illness and could barely see in front of him.

The bull horns are the most distinct feature of his armor.</p><p>He was one of the most seasoned battle commanders in the Eastern Army and led the front line against the Western Army. He was given personal permission to have the first strike against the Western Army, but Ii Naomasa and Matsudaira Tadayoshi took that away from him when their gunman fired. With their shots, Fukushima aggressively charged Ukita's army signifying the full start of the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3374_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Kuroda</b> Nagamasa <span class='ja'>黒田長政</span> wore armor similar to this costume. Big 'ol square head.</p><p>Kuroda was Tokugawa's chief military strategist and perhaps the most cunning strategist in all of Japan. His army was stationed on Okayama, north east of the main battlefield and covered Ishida's flank, forcing him into the center of the fight. He also conspired with Kobayakawa to turn him against Ishida, ultimately allowing Tokugawa to win the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next costume armor is of <b>Kobayakawa</b> Hideaki <span class='ja'>小早川秀秋</span>. The red robe and trident ornament on the helmet are the most distinguishing features.</p><p>Kobayakawa was only 19 year old at the time of the battle. His army was the second most numerous in the Western Army, consisting of 15,000 troops. His troops stayed at Matsuoyama and did not engage in the battle until he finally made the decision to betray Ishida and attack Otani of the Western Army. As mentioned above, Otani committed seppuku as a result, and the rest of the Western Army quickly fell.</p><p>Because of his role in the battle, Tokugawa increased Kobayakawa's standing by giving him all castles and lands previously owned by Ukita, which included Okayama castle and vast territories in Bizen. Although, at 21 years old, he drank himself to death. He had no heir, so Kobayakawa was officially dissolved.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Lastly, we have a costume simliar to the armor of <b>Shimadzu</b> Yoshihiro <span class='ja'>島津義弘</span>. The leaping fox ornament of the helmet is its most distinguishing feature.</p><p>He and his nephew were members of the Western Army. After the battle had been lost, they refused to retreat by showing their backs to the enemy. So with the little manpower they had left, they charged through the center of the battlefield completely surprising Tokugawa and the eastern armies. They broke through the line and continued charging south to make their retreat. His nephew was killed in the assault, but Yoshihiro made it through.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides the fancy replica armor, they had a few sets of armor that had been weathered to look more realistic. The above armor was made after armor belonging to <b>Katou</b> Kiyomasa <span class='ja'>加藤</span> <span class='ja'>清正</span>, distinctive because its one meter high helmet. </p><p>Katou was a member of the Eastern Army, but was not in the Battle of Sekigahara. He was battling and defeating Ishida's allies in Kyushu at the same time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Along with Katou's armor were a few more pieces. I could not identify the middle armor, but armor on the left is of the Monnashi clan. The Monnashi clan was a military branch of what was left of the Fujiwara clan. The Fujiwara clan came to power around the 800s, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of information about it at the time of the Battle. There was no Monnashi army, and I think this was just a commander in the Tokugawa army.</p><p>There were a few other pieces there too, used by actors in the reenactment.</p><p>Overall, it was a fun surprise to see some of these after visiting the Sekigahara Battle Museum and Sengoku Armor museum. Even though these were costumes, all of the armor in the battle was pretty distinct, so you can usually identify it easily from its main characteristics.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kitayama in Late Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kitayama-late-winter">Kitayama in Late Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Kitayama is one of the most prominent mountains (or hill) in town offering a full view of Takayama and the eastern neighborhood of Sanfukuji.</p><p>On the north end of Kitayama is Kitayama Park, which is also the site of where Ayuzaki castle once stood. Kanemori famously stationed himself in this castle during his invasion of Hida. He used this castle as a vantage point to plan his attack on Matsukura castle across town, and finally secure the region.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2817_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2817_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2817_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2817_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2817_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Directly next to the park is a cemetary. I think there were a few plaques nearby explaining whose remains were entombed in the graves, but I didn't pay close attention.</p><p>Overall the cemetary is pretty small compared to the size of other cemetaries in Takayama.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2835.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2835.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2835_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2835_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2835_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing down the mountain is Ichi cafe, where I was meeting my client. This is also where you can park your car.</p><p>The mountain plateaus at this point and you can continue along for another great view of the city, and take the road back down.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2847_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2847_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2847_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2847_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2847_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Opposite of this great view is where the Kankou Hotel used to be. With prime real estate on the platea of Kitayama, it gave an amazing view. But now, Kankou Hotel has been completely demolished and the site is nothing but a flat dirt area. COVID was perhaps the final nail in the coffin for the Kankou Hotel. It was probably already struggling from the competition of other newer hotels in Takayama. </p><p>Over the last 10 years, tourism in Takayama has exploded, and with the massive income, new hotels have been built in areas next to the station. Kankou Hotel was so far out of the way, nobody would realistically walk there from the station. They did have shuttle busses, but even then, if someone staying at the Kankou Hotel wanted to walk around Takayama, they'd have to go down the mountain and then go back up when returning. It's so much easier for people to just stay in a hotel at street level.</p><p>And then COVID happened and foreign tourism was completely halted. To make up some of the lost revenue, the Kankou Hotel used its rooms for people infected with COVID during the lockdown. Local people called it the "COVID jail," and its reputation for being a terrible place grew from there, in addition to whatever cleanup the hotel had to do from its infected guests.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250309_kitayama/IMG_2872_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It sucks that such a prominent hotel in the area is now gone, but it's the nature of business.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghosts of Tsushima Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions">Ghosts of Tsushima Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

There are probably three acts, plus an extra area available the DLC expansion. So far, I think it's been a pretty benign experience, but I have been focusing solely on the open world elements of the game, rather than the story.</p><div class='title'><b>Story thus Far</b></div><p>Being Samurai is at the heart and soul of Ghosts, and this seems like the direction the story is headed. Ghosts describe Samurai as fearless just warriors who stand up and fight against all odds even at the cost of their lives. However, as a single warrior, you are constantly fighting against these odds. While it is the most honorable route, it is also the most foolish when it is not feasible or possible to win using such direct single-minded tactics.</p><p>A woman named Yuna had rescued you from Komoda beach. She moves undetected through grass, and cuts down the mongol enemies when they are unready. Moves deemed cowardly and underhanded from the point of view of a samurai. Dishonorable.</p><p>Through gameplay, Ghosts offers you two approaches to every battle: face your enemies head on, or pick off enemies one by one without being detected. There are a few glimpses of Jin struggling with his strict samurai code of honor when relying on stealth techniques too much. Hopefully it'll become core to the story.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>In most games, stealth is almost always the way to go. Fighting battles head on tend to overwhelm and you end up using more resources. So, it's best to pick off enemies one by one to even the odds before hopping in to finish the squirmish. Why fight five dudes at once, when you can end up fighting either one or two?</p><p>Ghosts has a nice gameplay solution for this as a Stand Off. Reveal yourself to the enemy and face them directly in a duel. Hold down the button and release right as they strike for an instant kill. This skill can be upgraded to take out three enemies at once, leaving only a few left to deal with after.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224002612_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It ends up becoming a much faster way of dealing with groups of enemies then using stealth, too. The game gives you a lot of tools and methods of taking down enemies, but I really haven't had a need to learn any of them. Dudes attack, I parry, then slash slash slash. This results in almost all battles ending up into the same battle again and again.</p><div class='title'><b>Exploration</b></div><p>In open world games, exploration is of absolute importance to me. Once free to explore, I immediately run off into the woods to find secrets, caves, dungeons, and items. Ghosts has plenty of that content. Pieces of map and points of interests reveal as you explore rather than having everything available as you start, which both encourages exploration and doesn't overwhelm with a thousand checkboxes on a to-do list. It allows you to play the game at your own pace.</p><p>There are a lot of dynamic environments that light up with the sunrise or sunset, like the golden forest of ginko trees and open fields full tall grass blowing in the moonlight. It's not too difficult to get some pretty shots with the amazing <b>Photo Mode</b>. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224150522_t.webp"/></a></p><p>Unfortunately, most of the shots end up looking the same. There's a distant visual tone to Ghosts, but none of the environments end up feeling distinct themselves. It's just the same areas with different colored trees or with higher rocks. Many of the buildings are copies of the same models used in other villages. Even the villagers are just copied over and over again.</p><p>For an open world game, it ultimately feels somewhat closed and limited. I feel like I had already hit the boundaries of the world (both literally and creatively) after 5 hours, and these last 15 hours have just been cleanup, making my way through repetitious open world side stories and ticking collectibles off a list. It's all pretty standard boring open world elements. Go here, pick up this, go there, kill this person.</p><p>Comparing worlds, Red Dead Redemption 2, which had been released two years prior to Ghosts, was a game that continued to feel alive and fresh for hours and hours, both in story and in environment. Everything in that game felt hand crafted and lived in. People felt real, too. It felt like an actual world. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224154410_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ghosts feels more like a high quality copy of Assassin's Creed so far with a lot of paint on the outside to distract you from what's underneath.</p><div class='title'><b>History</b></div><p>With the release of Shogun last year, I've been thinking about and contextualizing Japanese history more than I had before. Shogun's story focused on a fictional version of Tokugawa and his actions leading to the Battle of Sekigahara. With his win, he assumes control of Japan as shogun ushering in the Edo Period in 1603.</p><p>Shogun was the title given to the military leader of Japan, who actually executed laws and governship through the words of the Emperor. This term originated in the Kamakura Period of Japan, which is when Ghosts takes place.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura_period" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamakura_period">Kamakura shogunate</a> overthrew the Emperor in 1185 and established themselves as the rulers of Japan. This was the first point in history where the Emperor did not "control" the country. As each territory and kingdom pledged their loyalty, high ranking soldiers within clans of those territories became deputized as samurai, a new kind of soldier.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224123313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Samurai had more power than standard soldiers as they could execute the will and actions of their lords as they see fit, rather than waiting for orders. At this time, the samurai designation was mostly reserved for members of the ruling class. But over time, more and more soldiers and members of clans became worthy of the title.</p><p>Again, Ghosts takes place around 1274 during the mongolian invasion, at the height of the Kamakura shogunate. Focusing only on military strength and expansion became their downfall as the government never actually produced anything to pay their subjects. The Emperor regained their power in 1333, starting the Muromachi Period. </p><p>Understanding the need to be suspicious of others and the benefits of working under darkness, breaking the code of samurai, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja#Predecessors" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja#Predecessors">Ninja</a> spies were officially trained and designated around the mid-1400s as the Emperor was overthrown again, fracturing Japan, and starting the Warring States Period of Japanese history.</p><p>Tactics of Ninja and Shinobi existed before the Warring States Period, but those terms were never used until then, and those actions were always viewed negatively until then.</p><p>It's interesting how these beliefs have been woven into the story of Ghosts. It's a bit unfortunate how the game doesn't contextualize any of this history. But, on the other hand, Ghosts seems to  accurately adhere to it, which is commendable compared to other fairytale stories of samurai made by poorly researched westerners.</p><p>The developer, Sucker Punch, has a clear reverence of the material and culture. This was even clear from the start when leading up to the announcement of the game at E3 2018. They had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Boots" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornelius_Boots">Cornelius Boots</a>, one of the world's leading masters of the shakuhachi, a traditional Japanese wooden flute, put on a performance. Although, because of the military rule of Kamakura, these performances had diminished greatly at this time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ghosts/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20250224112356_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Sequel</b></div><p>Shogun was one of the main reasons I had become interested in playing through Ghosts of Tsushima. But another reason was because of the sequel announced last year. Sucker Punch unveiled Ghosts of Yotei in September 2024 and announced its release for 2025. I wanted to finish the first game before the new one came out.</p><p>They announced that Yotei is not a direct sequel to Ghosts of Tsushima, taking place in 1603. This was the time that Tokugawa had just taken control of Japan and began instituting rules upon rules to strictly govern the country and prevent any uprising or opposition to his rule or weakening Japan to foreign entities.</p><p>It was also announced that Yotei takes place in Hokkaido. Prior to 1603, the Japanese (or Wajin) have only occupied the southern area of Hokkaido, while the rest of the island was home to its natives, known as Ainu. Japan wanted to strengthen its hold on Hokkaido (known as Ezo at the time) to prevent any possibly invasion from Russia.</p><p>Over the next hundred years, conflict and bloody battles erupted between the natives and Japanese before the entire island eventually came under Japanese rule. You play as Atsu, a female warrior, probably of the Ainu, through the origin of these conflicts.</p><p>No idea what time of year it'll take place, but the overall vibe should be a lot of mountain climbing and snow, compared to the sub-tropical island of Tsushima.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing</b></div><p>Anyways, I'm a bit down on Ghosts at the moment, but this is mostly tempering my expectations. I'm really surprised how the environments and interactions feel so old, when the game was released in 2020. This was the height of the Playstation 4, moments before the release of the PS5. Games had already been out by then with significantly more character in their story and engagement in their environments.</p><p>I'm right at the edge of the next significant story progression, so I hope things turn around.</p><p>I've taken a bunch of in-game photos, too. You can view them below.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kumano Shrine 熊野神社 &amp; Akahogi Park 赤保木公園" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kumano-shrine-and-akahogi-park-in-winter">Kumano Shrine 熊野神社 &amp; Akahogi Park 赤保木公園</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Takayama is surrounded by nature, forests, and mountains. All of these mountains shield us from the wind, so when it snows, it comes gently and fluffy, and piles up and up without getting blown over. This creates a beautiful frosted landscape.</p><p>With the constant snow, I wanted to go out and take some photos, and being test week, I had an afternoon available to do some exploring in the snow. There's a shrine at the edge of town nestled into the forest that I thought would be perfect to visit. This is Kumano Shrine.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumano Shrine <span class='ja'>熊野神社</span></b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0248_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The gate to the shrine is on the literal edge of the forest meeting the open fields. I parked near the side entrance, but then took the long route back down the road and back through the fields to meet this entrance.</p><p>We received about 1 meter of snow over the past couple of days on top of the snow we already had. The fields and paths to arrive to the gate were pretty deep, but the natural canopy of the forest shielded most of the rest of the path leading to the Shrine.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0286_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This presented a different problem, though. As the hardened tufts of snow in the tall trees got heavier, the branch eventually gave way to drop the snow, whiting out the path forward. The clumps of snow hitting the snow on the ground created the only sound available. A small gust of wind would rustle the branches, and then soft bum, bum, bums would follow, along with me curling up, protecting the camera, and facing away from the snow coming into my face.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0308_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was not difficult to climb the steps and reach the shrine.</p><p>The Kumano Shrine was officially recognized and protected by the city starting from July 10th, 1975. It is believed to be built around the year 1680. This was almost 100 years after Kanamori conquered the Hida area, and established it as a mountain oasis for his rich friends. Much of this wealth did trickle down improved the area, too.</p><p>The shrine was built by artist Ikemori Gengo <span class='ja'>池守源五</span> and funded by lacquerware artist Narita Sankyu <span class='ja'>成田三休</span>. Its style was totally fitting of other tradition buildings at the time, and the reliefs were made in the Shunkei lacquerware style, also notable in Hida.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0367_t.webp" /></a></p><p>According to the Internet, the main hall is the oldest original one still standing in Takayama. There was a hole punctured in the screen of the front door, so I could stick my camera lens through it. The shrine is still used today for Shinto ceremonies in the summer, like all shrines around town.</p><p>Being satisfied with my current stack of photos, I did not break in or walk around the back for more. I continued back to my car using the side entrance, while occasionally getting pelted by falling clumps of snow.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0387_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Akahogi Park <span class='ja'>赤保木公園</span></b></div><p>Before actually leaving, I remembered there was a small park behind the forest with the shrine. The shrine itself wasn't really deep in the forest. It was in a small pennisula of woods shooting out from the beginnings of the main western forest heading up to Mihakayama <span class='ja'>見量山</span>. I went hiking up there before <a href="/old/v7/mihakayama" title="/mihakayama">in 2016</a>.</p><p>I decided to take a look at the park real quick. Why not?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0397_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The park is an open area, but has a small preserved village next to it. This is the Akahogi Preservation Site, and the main thing it is perserving is a stone age wood furnace. It was discovered in 1954. Later in the 90s, archeologists and members of the historical society began restoring the area to capture the atmosphere of ancient Hida.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0406_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The most distinct buildings of ancient Hida are the Gasho-zukuri <span class='ja'>合掌造り</span>. They are mostly small wooden huts, although they can grow in size. They are very distinct because of their massive heavy thatched roofs which withstand the massive weight of Hida snowfalls. In the middle of the these homes, are fires that warm the whole interior.</p><p>There are a few open air museums in the area that have transported many of these buildings into their own town. In Takayama, <a href="/old/v7/hina-matsuri-in-hida-no-sato" title="/hina-matsuri-in-hida-no-sato">Hida no Sato</a> <span class='ja'>飛騨の里</span> is most well known.</p><p>Within the Akahogi village, I did not travel too far. I only approached the closest building, which also seemed like the only one open.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow was deep, but these buildings are built to last. Looking in from the outside, it was completely black. The blinding white of the snow made it difficult to see anything past the door. With all the bear signs around, I was a little bit cautious of a confrontation. But... eh. It's probably fine.</p><p>I jutted inside and was completely sheltered from the snow outside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0435_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe it was just my imagination, but it felt much warmer inside. Obviously, it offered complete protection of the wind, but it felt more than that. Maybe the straw of the roof retained or created some kind of heat.</p><p>In the middle, was the ancient fire pit, restored from the broken pieces found in the 50s. Nearby, a painted wooden plaque explained the purpose and usage of the fire pit. Obviously, it is pretty self explanatory to modern people, how the surrounding rocks can absorb and hold on the heat from the fire keeping the room warm. Also, how you can use the surface of the rocks to cook meat. The openings in the back and above the door allowed from the smoke the exit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0454_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, that was the end of my hike. I went back out the way I came, and returned to my car.</p><p>I parked in front of a building run by the Akahogi Historical Preservation Society. I thought about going in and poking my nose around, but I wasn't sure if it was actually open to the public. I'll come back in the spring for some comparison shots and updates.</p><p>Over night, it still continued to snow, and everyone had a chance the next day to show how bad of drivers they are. This included me, too, taking photos from my car while driving.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0476.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0476.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0476_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0476_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250220_kumano/IMG_0476_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Small Worlds" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/small-worlds">Small Worlds</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Subtitled as the Miniature Museum, it has four main massive-scale miniature models, where each single person is about the size of a thumbnail. These four areas are space-themed, fantasy-themed, the Kansai airport, and Tokyo-3. The space and fantasy themed areas are further divided into sub-areas with more focused themes.</p><p>Entry is a little pricey at 3200<span class='ja'>円</span>, but I think the price tag is worth it for a one-time visit. If you enjoy the museum a lot, they have a 3D scanning studio in the middle of the museum. From the 3D scans, they can print and color a 3D model of yourself. The cheapest one is 6600<span class='ja'>円</span> for a small figure of 1 person, but the price can come down with multiple people. Additionally, you could pay to have your figure be part of the museum.</p><p>I visited on a Friday afternoon, so the museum was pretty empty with only a few visitors.

You'd think it might be difficult to find such specific things in such a vast detailed world, but the whirring of the gears opening the treasure boxes gave them away. That being said, I could only find 4. I could hear a fifth one near the end. Although, it was always whirring, so maybe it was the broken O. Anyways, I won't give away the answer, but it's pretty obvious.</p><p>With the answer to the puzzle, you go back to the Space Center, whisper the word to the attendant at the concierge and get your prize, a piece of candy.

Above the city, the railways are elevated and move people to and from the large angular buildings. One of my favorite buildings was the library, where several floors of books are exposed to staircases surrounding the outside of the building.</p><p>Finally, past the capitol, is Zhenshimen City, where nightlife is king.

Every angle and vantage point looking into the buildings offered something new to be seen and discovered. Those remaining letters had to be in here somewhere, but I could never find them. Some of the buttons and interactions were broken in this area, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Creators Gallery</b></div><p>Before moving onto the third main area, there was an exhibition room for miniature diorama artists to display and sell their works.

The Tokyo Metro Building in west Shinjuku is one such building known for its twin towers. It was often depicted in classic anime series (particularly CLAMP series) as a source of power. In reality, it's a governmental building which administrates all the city affairs of Shinjuku and surrounding neighborhoods.</p><p>Besides that, the building serves another purpose which attracts quite a few tourists. Its observation deck is one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the whole city. And for free! I've been here several times before, and wrote about it too <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-metropolitan-building" title="/tokyo-metropolitan-building">over 10 years ago</a>.</p><p>I was in Tokyo for school business, and as school business concluded, it was near sunset and I was near the Metro Building. I met up with another teacher and some of our students, and we walked to the building to catch the sunset.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not only was our timing perfect, but because of the completely clear weather we had all weekend, Mt. Fuji was very visible right next to the sun.</p><p>The clear weather also gave a perfect view of that beautiful Tokyo skyline.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9972_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>There were a lot of people crowded around the west windows of the observation deck, but it wasn't as crowded as you'd think.

It didn't sustain the interest of my students and the other teacher, though, as they were waiting for me on a couch nearby. They were hungry as their school business of the day was just as long as mine. Also, they were in a bit of hurry since they had tickets for an event at 7pm. We had dinner as fast as we could, then I saw them off in a taxi. </p><p>Contemplating what to do with the rest of my evening, I decided to return to the observation deck and take some night photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last time I visited the Metro Building was in summer with some college friends in Japan on vacation.

In fact, this is the premiere location of Japan's full-sized Gundams, of which there are 3 now.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Since 2017, the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam occupies this spot. This Gundam is from the anime series and novel, Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. As I understand it, Gundam Unicorn was a soft reboot or retelling of the original Gundam story. Or maybe a modern side story set during the time of the original. Made in 2010, it was a breath of fresh air and a return to roots for the franchise after countless spinoffs, sequels, and over-saturation.</p><p>The most iconic of gundams is the original RX-78 model, which occupied this space from 2009 to 2016. It was built to celebrate the Gundam franchise's 30th anniversary. People say that it was replaced with the Unicorn Gundam as a symbol of Japan moving into the future, with their bid for the 2020 Olympics.</p><p>The original RX-78 Gundam is still sometimes used for events. It was recently used in front of the Gundam Factory in Yokohama, which closed last year. Now, it might be in Osaka according to Wikipedia. Another full-sized Gundam is in Fukuoka, which was completed in 2020.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After arriving in Tokyo for a business trip, I went to Odaiba to see the Gundam during sunset.

Photo Rogaining is a somewhat new sport that combines photography and running. It's like a photo scavenger hunt, except you are giving specific locations where to take the photos. The challenge is, by having no prior knowledge of the locations, you must quickly determine a route to reach as many checkpoints as possible, each checkpoint having different point values.</p><p>Prior to his message, I had no idea what this was. <span class='ja'>ロゲイニング</span>? I could not figure out the English word this was trying to be. Logging? Photo Logging? But, Photo Rogaining is the correct English. Rogaining as a sport began in Australia. Its first event was in the 70s. The name Rogaining comes from the 3 folks who invented it: Rod, Gail, and Neil. They just combined their names.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The full title of the event was <b>Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining - Celebrating the 500th Birthday of Nagachika Kanamori</b> -<span class='ja'>金森長近生誕</span>500<span class='ja'>年記念</span>- <span class='ja'>飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング</span>. Kanamori is a very special historical figure for the town. We have a statue of him in the Castle Park.</p><p>Head of the Kanamori Clan, Nagachika led his troops as an arm of the Tokugawa Clan and conquered northern Gifu and eventually Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui. Becoming the daimyo of the area, Kanamori transformed Takayama into a small-sized castle town to encourage tourism of other rich lords. He established what would become modern day Takayama. </p><p>So, the event commemorates the 500th anniversary of his birth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Takayama event was advertised around town a little bit. The starting point as well as the main venue was the Takayama City Historical Museum downtown. The poster had a link to the website for more information: <a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/">https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/</a></p><p>There were 6 different categories of participants: Family Team, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team, Men's Solo, and Women's Solo. The event had a limit of 100 entrees, but we only had around 40 people total? A few didn't show up, but overall I don't think the event was advertised all that well. I'm really glad my friend sent me the info.</p><p>My friend joined a team with his daughter. There were 3 or 4 family teams. The biggest category was the Mixed Teams with 9 separate teams competing. The second biggest category was my category, Men's Solo. We had 6 individuals.</p><p>The schedule was as follows:<br/><b>11:00</b> - Reception<br/><b>12:00</b> - Start<br/><b>15:00</b> - Finish<br/><b>15:30</b> - Awards Ceremony</p><div class='title'><b>Rules</b></div><p>On the Japanese Photo Rogaining site, they listed some general rules. It was not exhaustive, so I didn't completely understand everything. Through the course of the event, I was able to understand the rules better, and now I have a much better grasp of what I could've done to place higher than I did.</p><p>Reception for the event was 11am at the museum. At check-in, we got our bib, number, and a packet with our map, which we were not allowed to open yet. Around 11:30am, they began explaining all the rules for the event. Again, I would've preferred they had all the rules clearly listed, so I could've double checked everything.</p><p>At 11:50am, 10 minutes prior to the start, we could open our maps and look at all of the objectives.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" /></a></p><p>Several points on the map were ones I had guessed earlier, but I had no idea it would push out as far as <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura Kanon and Matsukura Castle ruins</a>. In reality, it's only 5 or 6km away. Normally isn't that far, but both of these are on the top of a mountain. Steep vertical ascents in a marathon are rough. On the other hand...  63 and 65 points are really high values, along with 43 and 47 on the way.</p><p>I didn't have a lot of time to think or compare this to the other points. I know that I wanted to climb up Shiroyama (castle park) for those points. So, my plan was to get some nearby points, go up Shiroyama for those points, and then push off west for Hida no Sato at least. On my return, I would keep north to grab all of those points before the end.</p><div class='title'><b>Start</b></div><p>As the event began, one of the Solo guys immediately bolted to the stoplight and then west. I kept up with him to the stoplight, but I was going east. </p><p>I grabbed a photo of the rock wall leading up the hill, <b>Point 1</b>, labeled as <span class='ja'>えび坂のお多福</span>. Further east, I snapped a photo of this small park, <b>Point 14</b>, <span class='ja'>川上別邸史跡公園</span>, Kawakami's Historical Second Home park?, on the way to the Bell Tower at Soyu-ji Temple, <b>Point 31</b>, <span class='ja'>宗猷寺鐘堂</span>.

Behind the shrine is a hiking path that goes directly up to Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span>. I'm not sure too many people knew about that. Way faster than taking the road. In the center of Shiroyama Park is the bronze statue of Kanamori, <b>Point 24</b>, <span class='ja'>長近銅像</span>. This is also where I parked my car. I dumped all my extra packet stuff in my car, and continued.</p><p>Before taking the path up to the Takayama Castle Ruins, I quickly ran over to the nearby Shoren-ji Temple <span class='ja'>照蓮寺</span>, <b>Point 18</b>. The path going up the mountain is pretty steep. Stair, after stair. It's not so bad if you're hiking normally, but in a race, it's rough.
