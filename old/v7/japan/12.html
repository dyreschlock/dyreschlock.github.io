There are obviously very distinct buildings and landscapes in mainland Japan, but they all follow the same rules and have the same ideas at heart. Okinawan buildings are built to withstand typhoons and harsh summer heat. But even so, the concrete buildings have all been aged by the weather beating down on them.</p><p>Much of the architecture and stores come from the overall demographic of Okinawa, which is split into 3 mostly balanced cultures, compared to the overall Japanese culture of the mainland. These three cultures are Ryukyuan, Japanese, and American. The Ryukyuan culture comes from the original inhabitants of the islands until the Japanese emperor took over. The Japanese culture comes from the empire, obviously. And the American culture comes from the US Base in Kadena, and its influence.</p><p>Besides that, the other distinct thing about Okinawa is elevation. It is the flattest place in all of Japan. It's weird looking across the horizon and not seeing any mountains or high hills of any kind.</p><div class='title'><b>Kofun</b></div><p>While walking around Naha, I took a few photos of Kofun darted in various neighborhoods.</p><p>Kofun are ancient Japanese tombs or burial mounds. Kofun were constructed in Japan from the 3rd to 7th century and used to bury highly influential people of the area. Throughout Japan, over 150,000 kofun have been discovered, and archeologists have catalogued their contents, as well as the sarcophagi and those within.</p><p>In the main islands of Japan, Kofun actually look like burial mounds. A main circular room was constructed within the ground, with walls built up from rocks and a primitive version of plaster. Above ground, dirt was piled and compacted on the room the create stability. Attached to the circular room is a rectangular or trapezoidal area, given the mound its overall keyhole shape.</p><p>In Okinawa, Kofun are much smaller and are nicknamed "Turtle Back Tombs" because of their shape.</p><div class='title'><b>Photos</b></div><p>Below are the photos I took from walking around town and finding new and interesting things.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Former Navy Underground Headquarters" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/former-japanese-navy-underground-headquarters">Former Navy Underground Headquarters</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Mt. Norikura is one of the tallest mountains in Japan at over 3000 meters.  It's probably the most "magnificent" mountain viewable from Takayama City.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" /></p><p>The Goshikigahara plateau lies within those highborn forests on the west end of the mountain.  Technically, the area should be visible in the above photo.  The forests in this area have never been cut, or disturbed by human hands.  </p><p>In fact, the locals swear that the forests are inhabited by a specie of fairy.  They chat and play in the forest.  Female fairies twinkle like a rainbow.  Male fairies have a silver twinkle.  These fairy are only visible to humans who are pure of heart.  Any person that has caused harm to the environment by littering, or picking or breaking plants will never see them.  Which pretty much rules out everyone on earth.</p><p>If you want to tour Goshikigahara, you must make a reservation, and be accompanied with a guide to show you around.  Tours are about 8500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> ($85) at the lowest, and generally take about 7 hours.  You need to sign a consent form, too.</p><p>On this particular day, I was quite fortunate to be part of a tour put together by the city of Takayama.  It was only 6000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>, too. :) This tour was in honor of a very special guest that came to Takayama, Dr. Miya____?  On Saturday, volunteer city officials joined the doctor at the Hida Wisdom Earth Center, and planted a field of trees.  I joined them as part of the city.</p><p>On Sunday, we met with the doctor again as we started our 9 hour trek through the mountainous forest.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Short Course <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ショートコース</span></span></b></div><p>The tour brought us along the <b>Short Course</b> of Goshikigahara.

We started walking the course around 9:30am.  There was a light rain in the air.  It was nothing heavy or torrential.  It made the wooden walking bridge incredibly slick, though.  Our group continued across it at a very slow pace to make sure no one slipped and hurt themselves.</p><p>We stopped every couple of minutes, and Dr. Miya___? gave a speech explaining the surrounding fauna.  When we reached the actual wasabi plants, he bent down, and pulled up a wasabi plant for all of us to examine.  Each of us, pricked a tiny portion of the plant and ate it.  I could definitely taste a hint of wasabi, but it wasn't nearly as potent as the stuff you'd have at restaurants, or grocery stores.  He gave us another wasabi plant to taste.  This time, I tried part of the stem, and that definitely held the potent spicy flavor I was used to.</p><p>We continued through the light rain, and Miya___? continued to give light explanations of the environment around us.</p><p>After about 40 minutes, we reached the road once again and met with the Snake Dashidani Bridge <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>蛇出谷橋</span></span> (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>じゃだしだに</span></span>).  And right next to the bridge, was the first waypoint, and the beginning of the Short Course.</p><div class='title'><b>1.

In the above picture, he mentioned that the plants under our feet are incredibly resilient.  They can be stepped on, or driven over, but they are unharmed and continue to grow.  </p><p>The plants behind him are grass and weeds that have grown without the intervention of mankind.  Without anyone cutting them, or taking care of them, nature can grow completely out of hand on its own.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Iwanami Hut was the end of the journey for the doctor.  He was not able to travel with us for the entirety of the hike today.  But, it was great to be able to meet him, and partially understand some of the wisdom he attempted to impart on me.</p><p>At this point, our big group split into 2.  The men formed the first group, and the women formed a group behind us.  There were 6 of us, including the guide.  We left to begin the Short Course around 10:30am.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" /></p><p>The road continued into the woods.  Much like Miya___?, our guide pointed out many of the interesting plants.  The above plants were described at trumpets by the local people who first came to the mountain thousands of years ago.  Several creeks, and water flows ran underneath the road carrying the rain water the pounded us earlier.</p><p>But, our path was basically just a road.  There was enough room for any automobile to drive up here, so it didn't really feel like some mountainous path.  It just felt like a service road.</p><p>20 minutes after we began the Short Course, we reached our first waypoint.</p><div class='title'><b>2. Shirabe Marsh Entrance / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>シラベ沢口</span></span></b></div><p>The Shirabe Marsh Entrance (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>さわぐち</span></span>) marked the highest point in our hike at 1640 meters.  There was a clearing, which was probably for any vehicles to turn around.  There was a pretty gnarly lookin' tree on one side, and the path to the woods on the other.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" /></p><p>We entered the path, and this felt like the true start to our hike.  This was the Seseragi <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>せせらぎ</span></span> path down the mountain.  It followed a stream of water.  This path was about 1.3 kilometers long, and took us down 150 meters in sea level.</p><p>We stopped several times as our guide explained what we were seeing in the forest.</p><p>He talked about the mushrooms and other fungus of the forest.  They are basically the "cleaners" of the forest.  Any dying or decaying matter in the forest is eaten by the fungus, and recycled back into nutrients for the living creatures of the forest.  The eat away disease and rot, and keep everything clean.</p><p>Additionally, as shown in the photo below, many of the trees have slight bulges in their trunks.  These are small pockets of sap squeezed out from the interior of the tree.  This sap is also vital to the ecological system of the forest, providing animals, and insects food and nutrients to sustain their lives.</p><p class='img'><img

Nunobiki Falls <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>布引滝</span></span></b></div><p>Next we met the actual treasure of this hiking trail, the Nunobiki Falls, which were directly next to the Yokote and Sakura-kon waterfalls.  Unlike the other 2 falls, the water forming Nunobiki was completely natural, squeezed from the rocks and reservoirs below the surface.  No amount of rain water would ever change the way these falls look.</p><p>This is rather evident when looking at the shape of the falls.  Rather than a concentrated source of water flowing over a cliff, several scattered pockets of water are shot through the cliff face, and flowing down the side.  If this waterfall was formed by a creek, stream or river, a singular focal point would've been carved out of the round over the course of thousands of years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After passing by the falls, I noticed something that was clearly manmade, and not in use for quite a while.  Apparently the early settlers of these lands mined for copper, zinc and iron.  The above structure was carved out of the rock to channel the water from the falls, and generate electricity for the mines.  In this area, watermills were set up to collect the energy and pass it on to the mines.</p><p>I guess, over the years, those watermills were removed to preserve the nature the falls.</p><div class='title'><b>10. Deai Hut <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>出合い小屋</span></span></b></div><p>A few hundred meters away was our final destination of the hike.  We got there around 2:30pm.  Our busses were already waited for us at the Deai Hut.  We went inside, and got a chance to change our clothes again, so we weren't walking around soaking wet.</p><p>We got there well before the women's group, so nearby our guide showed us some funky moss.  Underneath some nearby rocks were moss than reflected any light passing into it.  I'm not sure if my photo really highlights this interesting phenomena, but it was a neat trick.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" /></p><p>Despite being a cold and rainy day, I think the hike was totally worth it.  For the last year and a half, I've lived in the foothills off these mountains, and never saw any of this stuff up close.</p><p>One of the greatest things about living in Takayama is the vast amount of nature that surrounds me everyday.  Well over half the city's area is covered in this wilderness forged from the depths of earth at the basins of several volcanoes.  It's absolutely stunning and beautiful. :)</p><p>Hopefully before I leave Takayama, I'll have a chance to hike the second trail available, which features many more waterfalls.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Oak Village" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/oak-village">Oak Village</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This company was established in 1974 and created almost anything out of wood, from as small as keychains and children's toys, to as large as homes and office buildings.</p><p>The Oak Village stand by 3 principles:</p><p><b>Craftsmanship with a 100-year guarantee</b> <i>"We strive to create products that will last at least as many years as the age of the trees used in those products.  It is our way of paying respect to the forests from which we receive great resources, and in the meanwhile, we can plant and nurture trees to grow new forests."</i></p><p><b>From Bowls to Buildings</b> <i>"Using solid wood (as opposed to plywood or veneer), we use different parts of a given tree for different purposes.  We create a wide range of wooden products, ranging from small articles like accessories and tableware, to larger items like furniture, and we also specialize in wooden architecture.  Through our products we hope to support the needs of a sustainable lifestyle."</i></p><p><b>One Acorn for Every Child</b> <i>"If we take one tree from a forest, we must give one back.  Out of this belief, we created a sister NPO, Donguri no Kai (Acorn Club), which plants and nurtures tree saplings, and maintain healthy forests in various places in Japan.  We hope to create a sustainable cycle of resource usage and renewal."</i></p><p>This year they're celebrating their 40th anniversary.  The Oak Village began with five men working on wood-crafts in a barn.  They continued to make high quality products.  That became their hallmark, and gave them success.  The products they created were born out of the 1000year woodcrafting tradition of Kiyomi with modern advancements of treating woods, and modern styles, as well.  Everything created in the Oak Village is 100% natural, and 100% made from resources of Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Kiyomi Location</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" /></p><p>It's located a few kilometers west of the Takayama Nishi highway exit, and in the middle of the woods they craft and carve into usable and useful items.

They gave me a copy of their quarterly magazine, too, which features articles of their past and current architectural plans.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at their website: <a href="http://oakv.co.jp/" title="http://oakv.co.jp/" title="http://oakv.co.jp/">http://oakv.co.jp/</a>.

I don't know about shipping though.</p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Car Wash Graveyard" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/carwash-graveyard">Car Wash Graveyard</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I was looking for some areas marked on a mark that apparently no longer existed.

| June 18, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Last weekend, I attended the Takaoka Half Marathon for the second time.  Last year, the race was in November, and it was a much cooler day.  I wrote about that here: <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">November 18th</a>.  </p><p>Last year, although, I trained and was in alright shape, the time limits set by the race prevented me from finishing.  I made it to the 17.3km gate at 1 minute too late.  So, I definitely planned on signing up again and vowing to complete the marathon!</p><div class='title'><b>This Year</b></div><p>Well, I did not train nearly as much as I did last year.  Last year, there were other people I signed up with, and we trained a few times together, and had some fun.  We were a team.  This year, it was just me.  And I had been so busy and tired with school that I barely trained at all.  I am still doing Kendo, but even then, I still occasionally miss Kendo practice due to the amount work needed to teach at my schools.</p><p>So, I was not nearly in the shape I was last year.  I was totally prepared for not finishing.  In fact, my time probably would've been better spent had I simply skipped the event.  But whatever…  I'll still drive down there, and make it as far as I can.</p><div class='title'><b>The Race</b></div><p>This year's course was identical to last year's.  Of course, this year it was in June, rather than November.  The morning wasn't too bad.  There was a nice breeze, and the clouds prevented the sun from heating everyone up.</p><p>At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony, where the Takaoka athletic association said some words, and last year's winners came up to the front and said their words, too.  Blah blah blah, I have no idea what they said.</p><p>After the opening ceremony, the half marathon race was the first to gather at the starting line.  Then the clouds started to open up and let the sun in.  Ugh, it was hot.  At 9am, some old guy fired his starting pistol and everyone was off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Time Limits</b></div><p>Once again, just like last year, the race had a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  This limit is enforced by 2 intermediary checkpoints throughout the race.  The first checkpoint is at 12.7km for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The second checkpoint is at 17.3km for 2 hours.  If you make it to these checkpoints late, the volunteers will stop you, and force you to quite.  Then you must wait for a bus to pick you up and bring you back to the start.  </p><p>Last year, I made the first checkpoint, but could not pass the second one.  I was only 1 minute late. :/</p><p>With the shape I was in this year, I had no intention of doing any better.  In order to complete the checkpoints, and the race, I needed to keep a pace of less than 7 minutes per kilometer (that's around 11 minutes per mile).</p><p>Whatever… let's get this marathon over with.</p><div class='title'><b>Running</b></div><p>Again, the course was the same.  But, since I was running at a much more leisurely pace, I stopped to take a few more photos than last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" /></p><p>I really tried at the beginning, but after 2k, my body was too fat, and heavy, and I was not going to have the energy to overcome it.  Additionally, I kept thinking about all the crap still outstanding on my to-do list, and the increasingly little time I had to complete them.  Ugh, why am I here?  Why am I doing this?  This isn't fun.  I'm not really getting anything out of this either.</p><p>The increasing pressure of all my responsibilities kept me from actually enjoying the run, and thinking about things clearly.  Usually during a marathon, I can push away all of my thoughts, empty my mind, and think about things without any noise.  My brain stops trying to analyze everything, and I can simply think…</p><p>All I could think about were my upcoming classes, and all the preparation work I still needed to do, and try to figure out when I could actually do the work.  And then think about my classes after, and how was I going to have the energy to do any of this after running this race.</p><p>So, this marathon sucked, and I did terrible at it.  Though, there were a few sparing moments I could lose myself in my music, but then came the crushing reality of my fat ass.</p><div class='title'><b>"Finishing"</b></div><p>Anyway, at around 10 o'clock, I passed the 9km marker.  I quickly thought to myself that I was still alright for time.  Only 3km left to the 12km checkpoint.  I can make that in 30 minutes.  15 minutes later, I remembered that the checkpoint was actually 12.7km, and that my pace was terrible.</p><p>I passed the 12km before the 10:30 mark, but arrived at the checkpoint more than 6 minutes late.</p><p>Whooo, failure!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't the only one there, and there were still people behind me, too.  I still have not broken my cardinal rule of not placing last in a race.  I was only 7th or 8th from last!</p><p>Once everyone else behind us got to the checkpoint, the bus of shame arrived to transport everyone back to the start.  We traversed the course backwards, and made it back to the start before 11am.  So, there were still people finishing the race as we arrived.  Our tracking chips were returned in the bus, though, so we couldn't just jump back on the track and finish the race. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" /></p><p>So, while I didn't finish the race, and did much more horribly than last year, I was able to leave much earlier and not damage my legs too much.  The race was still finishing as I walked back to my car to return to Takayama.</p><div class='title'><b>Vow</b></div><p>I still vow to complete this race in the future!  I wonder if this race happens twice a year, which explains the date change from last year.  November was way more comfortable to run, too.  The heat was terrible for this race. :(<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to History of Kiyomi Public Schools (Part 1)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools">History of Kiyomi Public Schools (Part 1)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 3, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>I teach at 4 different schools, and the main schools that I teach at are in the village of <b>Kiyomi</b>, which is part of Takayama city.  Today, Kiyomi has 1 junior high school, and 1 elementary, but it used to have a whole lot more.</p><p>Last year, Kiyomi Junior High School celebrated its 50th year.  And this year, Kiyomi Elementary celebrates its 40th.  When both schools were opened, it was the consolidation of all the education in Kiyomi into a single building.</p><p>Back when I first started at Kiyomi, I spent a few days in the Library, and looked through books in their "local" section.  I found a book published by the City Council of Kiyomi that was basically the almanac of the village.  It details Kiyomi's agriculture, industry, demographics, and history.  There was a section of the book titled <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>わたしの学校</span></span> (or "My School") which I found quite fascinated.  It had a timeline of all the schools that ever existed in Kiyomi village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, I present to you: The History of Kiyomi Schools.</p><p><i>Much of the general historical information was taken from Wikipedia.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Meiji Period</b></div><p>The earliest schools in Kiyomi date all the way back near the beginning of the Meiji period.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>明治</span></span>6, 7, and 8 marked the beginning of Kiyomi's 6 major schools.  That's 1873, 1874, and 1875.</p><p>The Meiji period marked the beginning of Japan's restoration to bring themselves out of their feudal society and into the modern world that was way more advanced than they were.  Education was one of the biggest concerns in the country.  In 1871, the Ministry of Education was established with a school system closely based on the United States.  They created elementary, middle, normal, and university school systems.</p><p>Elementary schools taught primary education are were meant to create loyal subjects to the Emperor of Japan.  Middle schools were secondary education, and were basically the equivalent of a High School.  They were to prepare students to enter Universities, and the Universities were to create students into leaders and modernize Japan.  Normal schools were training schools for graduates of middle schools who wanted to become teachers. </p><p>By 1900, Enrollment in public schools was 90%, whereas the start of the Meiji era only had 50%.<br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>At this time, the 6 schools in Kiyomi were:</p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞尋常小学校</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>まきがほら</span></span> / Makigahora<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>福奇尋常小学校</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ふくより</span></span> / Fukuyori<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>巣野俣尋常小学校</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>すのまた</span></span> / Sunomata<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>夏厩尋常小学校</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>なつうまや</span></span> / Natsuumaya<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>池本尋常小学校</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>いけもと</span></span> / Ikemoto<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>大原尋常小学校</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>おっぱら</span></span> / Oppara</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>Kiyomi had 2 branch schools, too:</p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>森茂分教場</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>もりも</span></span> / Morimo<br/><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>楢谷分教場</span></span> / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ならだに</span></span> / Naradani</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Each school (and branch school) is named after the neighborhood it resides it.</p><p>The official declaration of a school was <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>尋常小学校</span></span>.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>尋常</span></span> or <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>じんじょう</span></span> translates as public, or common.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>小学校</span></span> (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>しょうがっこ</span></span>) is elementary school.  Branch schools were <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>分教場</span></span> (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ぶんきょうじょう</span></span>).</p><p>Higher education became increasingly important as Japan continued to industrialize.  In 1904, in Kiyomi, Makigahora, Fukuyori, and Natsuumaya all changed their designation to <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>尋常高等小学校</span></span> adding the <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高等</span></span> into their names.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高等</span></span>, or <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>こうとう</span></span>, stands for "high class."  It's also the same word used for Senior High School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高等学校</span></span>.</p><p>In 1907, elementary school attendance was made mandatory.  From now on, all children in Japan were required to have 6 years of primary education.  Middle schools were only required for students who wanted to go to a university, or normal school.</p><div class='title'><b>Taisho Period</b></div><p>In 1912, Emperor Meiji passed away, and Taisho became the new emperor.  The educational system became even more centralized, but there were plenty of good things that happened.  The Extraordinary Council on Education was created in 1917 and set forth many reforms.  Many more private colleges were now officially recognized.  Subsidies were introduced for poor families so their children could attend schools.</p><p>Education started to become much more militaristic, too.  And Japan started using a lot of educational ideas from Germany to instill the ideas of nationalism, patriotism, and militarization.</p><div class='title'><b>Showa Period</b></div><p>Nationalism and Militarization continued as Japan entered World War II.  In 1941, the educational system renamed all of its schools to <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>国民学校</span></span> (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>こくみんがっこ</span></span>), which means National People's Schools.  This is taken from the German language.  Nation People's School translates as Volksschule, which is interesting, too.  Schule is School in German.  Volks stands for "people of", "national", etc.  The name Volkswagen makes a lot of sense now.</p><p>The elementary schools now required mandatory military training.  The principles of education now taught traditional, political, religious, and moral values.  Every day was to serve the Empire of Japan.  Every school in Japan turned into a cult of worship building loyal soldiers to die for their country.</p><div class='title'><b>Post-War</b></div><p>In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, and the educational system of Japan had collapsed.  As the United States occupied Japan and rebuilt it, there were several specific missions sent to rebuild the educational system.</p><p>One of these new reforms was to recreate the division between the levels of schooling to resemble the US.</p><p>Before now, elementary education was 6 years, secondary education was 3 years, and higher education (university) was 4 years.  Only elementary schools were mandatory.  The reforms now created two tiers of secondary education: lower and upper, and made lower secondary education mandatory for all students.</p><p>This created the following:</p><p><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>小学校</span></span> - Elementary Schools - Elementary education for 6 years.

This is the system that Japan follows today.  Even though Senior High Schools are not required, 94% of junior high school graduates apply and enter high school.

Both Morimo Branch School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>森茂分校</span></span>, and Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span></span> still served some junior high students, but only in the winter when traveling to Kiyomi JHS was too difficult.  For Junior High, both schools operat as branch schools of Kiyomi JHS, whereas for elementary, they operated as branch schools of the nearby elementaries.</p><p>Also, Kiyomi JHS had an attached dormitory.  During the winter months, and throughout the year, students would be able to live at the school rather than make the journey home.</p><p>In its first year, the graduating class of Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>清見中</span></span> was 126 students, which were split between 3 classes at school.  The Junior High had an attached dormitory, so students from the distant areas of Kiyomi lived at school for the whole week before returning home for the weekend.</p><p>I think it became a real point of pride for Kiyomi when the junior high school opened.  For the first time in its history, all the village's students attended the same school, and had classes together.  It really brought everyone together, and became a symbol for the community of Kiyomi.</p><div class='title'><b>Consolidation</b></div><p>A few years after Kiyomi JHS opened, the lingering branch schools began closing and filtering their students into the junior high school, and existing official nearby elementary schools.  Though, this was also more likely because the more remote regions of Kiyomi were no longer self-sustaining, and people were moving into the more populated areas.</p><p>The Sunomata ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>巣野俣小</span></span> building closed in 1965, and all their students now went to Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>福寄小</span></span>.  And with the closure of Sunomata, the Naradani Branch School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span></span> closed, too.  Any students in Naradani probably just went to Oppara ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>大原小</span></span>.</p><p>The Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span></span> changed it's name to Winter Branch School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>冬期分校</span></span> in 1965.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>冬期</span></span> or <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>とうき</span></span> is Japanese for Winter Term, so I'm guessing this school was only used in the winter to relieve the students of the dangerous daily journey to school.  It stayed open for another 3 years, and closed for good in 1968.</p><p>Also, in 1968, the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span></span> of Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>池本小</span></span> closed.</p><p>Kiyomi now had 5 operating elementary schools, and one distant branch school (Morimo <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>森茂分校</span></span>).

Makigahora ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞小</span></span>, Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>福寄小</span></span> both closed and their students now attended Kiyomi ES.  Natsuumaya ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>夏厩小</span></span> closed as well, and those students filtered into Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>池本小</span></span>.</p><p>The two most distant schools, Oppara ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>大原小</span></span> and Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>池本小</span></span>, continued to operate after Kiyomi ES was open.</p><p>The Morimo Branch <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>森茂分校</span></span> finally closed, too, on the eve of Kiyomi ES's opening.  I think the final remaining residents of that neighborhood finally moved closer in Kiyomi, or another neighboring area.  Which left Morimo completely uninhabited.</p><p>10 years later, in 1984, Ikemoto ES closed its doors, and its students went to Kiyomi ES.  And then, finally, in 2003, Opara ES closed, too.  </p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>And that brings us to today.

Both of which all students in Kiyomi attend.</p><p>It's really hard to believe that Kiyomi JHS could actually hold 126 students in each class.  Today, each class has 23 to 27 students.  The population decline in Japan is very real, and it's very apparent when you start viewing the historical records in the schools.  Each year, graduating classes get a little bit smaller, and a little bit smaller.
