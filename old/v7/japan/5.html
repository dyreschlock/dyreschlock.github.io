| January 31, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last year, the US had a rare chance to observe a total solar eclipse.  During the day, the moon moved in front of the sun and cast parts of America in darkness for a short time.  Total lunar eclipses are not so rare and seem to happen fairly regularly.  The website <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/" title="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/">https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/</a> has a list of all their occurrences past and present.</p><p>Living in Japan, I’ve already seen one total lunar eclipse in <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon">October 2014</a>.  It was a beautiful and clear night, so the red, blood moon cast in the Earth’s shadow was in clear clear view.</p><p>This January, there was another total eclipse, which began around 8:30pm.  The weather was cloudy, but it was light with many breaks.  The moon was clearly visible in the sky.  </p><p>It was also cold cold cold.  It was definitely below zero.  Maybe -4?  I thought about driving to somewhere beautiful and open to view the eclipse, but it was just too cold for me to sit outside.  The moon was clearly visible from my apartment, so I simply set up my tripod in my kitchen, opened the window, and shot the moon from there.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the lack of indoor heating in Japan, the cold temperature indoors really made no difference.  My apartment usually feels like it’s colder inside than outside anyway.  It only lacks the wind.  Besides, sitting under a pile of blankets (as I usually do at home) would be warmer than sitting around outside.</p><p>Here was the schedule for the eclipse:</p><p>Penumbral begins - 7:50pm<br/>Partial begins - 8:50pm<br/>Full begins - 9:50pm<br/>Maximum - 10:30pm<br/>Full ends - 11:10pm<br/>Partial ends - 12:10pm<br/>Penumbral ends - 1:10pm</p><p>The penumbral is a partial shading or dimming of the moon as the Earth begins to eclipse the sun.  The partial is when the full shadow begins to engulf the moon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the moon well into the penumbral and minutes before the partial began to creep.  I don’t really see much difference.  I guess maybe the moon dimmed a little bit more than normal, but it’s still in full view.</p><p>But as the partial began, the moon definitely started to show a noticeable difference.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The shadow started to form in the lower left and, steadily over the next hour, it would move the completely cover the moon.</p><p>Unfortunately, as the moon continued to rise higher in the sky, it was met with more and more clouds.  The moon still showed through the clouds, but became dimmer and more obscured.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was still able to stretch the focal length of my camera and extend the exposure to capture the moon, but with time passing, the details and of the moon blurred more and more.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As 9:50pm approached and the total eclipse should have been visible, the cloud cover became too great, and I lost any visual of the moon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It’s unfortunate, but I was glad to be able to see as much of the eclipse as I did.  I went outside a few times after to try and see it, but the clouds completely cover the sky.  I couldn’t even remotely tell where the moon would be behind the clouds.</p><p>Not everywhere in Japan was covered up, though.  Down in Gifu City, it was a completely clear night.  Same with Nagoya and Tokyo.  There were some photographs that came out of Tokyo that are quite stunning.</p><p>I made a few animated gifs with the several photos of the eclipse I was able to take. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/180131_moon-prog.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/180131_moon-prog.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/180131_moon-prog.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/180131_moon-loop.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/180131_moon-loop.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/180131_moon-loop.webp" /></p><p>The next total lunar eclipse visible in Japan will be in July, but it’ll be an early morning eclipse rather than one at night.  It will be visible for a little while before the moon sets over the horizon.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kendo San-dan 三段" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kendo-sandan">Kendo San-dan 三段</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 24, 2017 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><span class='ja'>剣道三段に合格しました</span>！</p><p>Right on track.  After passing the ni-dan test two years ago, I’ve been able to continue practicing and learning more about the Japanese martial art of kendo.  And last weekend, I was able to pass the 3rd level of dan, san-dan, in kendo.  </p><p>According to the sensei giving the test, I am the first foreigner to pass this test in Gifu.  Breakin’ boundaries!  Though, that title obviously comes with some caveats.  There are plenty of other foreigners living in Japan that have passed this test, and are way higher rank than me.  They just don’t live in Gifu.  If Gifu had a higher foreign population, someone would’ve passed this test long ago.  It’s more a sign of foreign folk living in more remote areas of Japan.</p><p>I was certainly nervous going into the test.  I understood everything that was required of me, but I wasn’t sure if I could do everything perfectly and correctly.  I don’t think I would’ve been able to pass if it wasn’t for my new job working at Takayama Nishi High School, and practicing kendo with the students, especially the 3rd year students, nearly every day for the last two months.  It was really rewarding taking the same test with those students, and all of us passing.</p><p>Passing the test with my 3rd year high school students is also very apt because I feel like san-dan level is analogous to high school level proficiency and knowledge in kendo.  Passing san-dan is like graduating high school in kendo.  And, in a few months, the 3rd year students will actually graduate high school.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Levels</b></div><p>I previously remarked that passing ni-dan just felt like a stepping stone.  San-dan was the true next test.  But, after talking with some people about it, I don’t think that’s exactly true.  In fact, I think the high school analogy works pretty well.  The 1st grade kyu, or ikkyu, is equivalent to elementary school proficiency.  1st grade dan is like the beginning of junior high school, and 2nd grade dan is completing junior high school.  3rd grade dan is completing high school.  After completing high school, you’re an adult in kendo.  Fully proficient in kendo.</p><p>The next level is 4th grade dan, which could be thought of as completing college.  You are now a full professional in kendo.  Kendo is no longer just something you did, it is something you do.  You have proven that you are kendo.  With the next grade, 5th dan, it’s like completing a masters or a phd program.  You are not only a professional kendo practitioner, but also a specialist in kendo.  Typically, 4th and 5th grade dan are the lowest levels where one leads their own dojo or has a sensei status within their own dojo.</p><p>Beyond that are 6th, 7th, and 8th dan.  These levels are only awarded on a national level.  A practitioner is now nationally recognized as a master in kendo.  Even though kendo is a life of continued study of the art, most lessons are learned through teaching others, and contributing to the martial art as a whole.  You are now a master that others look up to.  </p><p>Anyway, I think this is a pretty good comparison.</p><p>Having passed the test of adulthood in kendo (3rd grade), the next step is becoming a professional in the martial art (4th grade).  Apparently, people consider this the next big step.  Probably because of the age requirements.  4th grade dan is the first level only adults can take.  </p><p>In Gifu, 4th and 5th grade dan tests are only done twice a year and with everyone in the prefecture.  Up through 3rd dan, the proctors travel around to different regions several times throughout the year.  It’s a much bigger deal with much fewer practitioners taking the test.</p><p>But, for me, that’s in 3 years.  It’s not enough to simply "cram" for the test starting 2 months in advance.  I need to continue practicing throughout these next 3 years and retain the ideals of my current grade so I’m able to reach beyond it.  Thankfully, I work at the perfect school and live in a great town to make this happen.</p><p><i>Update: March 1st</i></p><p>Today, all of the 3rd year students graduated from high school.  We also received everyone’s certificate for completion of 3rd grade dan back in November, so they were able to get them before they left officially left school.  It’s very fitting (though also convenient) to get them today as I consider passing san-dan as the equivalent of completing high school.</p><p>I got my certificate, too. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/171124_kendo/IMG_4941_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having now mastered the basics of doing kendo for myself, 4th grade dan and up is the study of being able to instructor others on the best ways to do kendo and guide them on the right path while sharpening your own skills.  And as high school students graduate, they continue to university and college and do exactly that with either kendo or their own profession.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Onsen of Hida 飛騨温泉" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-onsen-of-hida">The Onsen of Hida 飛騨温泉</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The forests that cover the roaming mountains strengthen, and show their brilliant deep green.  They fade into the horizon and turn from green to blue to match the sky.  Carved out of the valleys are small pockets of civilization where we live, surrounded by this awesome, beautiful nature.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>A strong part of the traditions of our area are onsen.  Onsen are facilities and hotels centered around a hot spring bath. A hot bath is the perfect cool down after exercise.  Intense physicality met with passive recovery.  The therapeutic effects of an onsen come from the temperature of the water, and its chemical make-up.  Though, I think the main reason people come to the onsen of Hida is the beautiful serene nature that surrounds you as you bath and relax.</p><p>You can receive the temperature benefits from any public bath in Japan.  Water temperature tends to be around 40ºC.  The hot water expands the muscles in your body and improves blood circulation.  The body works hard to cool itself, which increases your metabolism.  An onsen might also have a cold bath around 20º or below.  Lying in this pool is massively chilling and forces your muscles to tighten and contract.</p><p>The idea of contrast therapy is to hop back into a 40º bath, and alternate back and forth.  This soothes and heals muscle soreness, facilitates recovery, and conditions the body and skin against temperature change.  It feels fantastic, but be careful.  The rapid changes can cause dizziness and even fainting.</p><p>The Hida area has more than 250 onsen.  Many onsen in Hida have additional therapeutic effects from the unique chemicals in the water.  Many of these places are outside of cities, set in forests near some beautiful hiking trails.  These are some of my favorites.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Far east in Takayama is Hirayu no Mori <span class='ja'>ひらゆの森</span>.  This is a sulfur (<i>you</i>) <span class='ja'>硫黄</span> containing sodium bicarbonate saline hot spring (<i>tansan suiso shio izumi</i>) <span class='ja'>炭酸水素塩泉</span>.  It contains other minerals, too, such as calcium <span class='ja'>カルシウム</span>, sodium <span class='ja'>ナトリウム</span>, magnesium <span class='ja'>マグネシウム</span>, and chloride (<i>enka butsu</i>) <span class='ja'>塩化物</span>.  Sulfur, bicarbonate, and chloride hot springs are all known for their healing effect on cuts and bruises.  Sulfur springs also helps lower high blood pressure.  Bicarbonate springs are known to wash fat from the skin leaving it young and beautiful looking.  Chloride springs connect with proteins on the skin to strengthen it.</p><p>The indoor baths are gorgeous, and have the feeling of a Japanese castle.  Outside baths are carved out of the rock, and allow you to lavish in the surrounding nature.  It’s the most beautiful onsen I’ve been to yet.  And entrance is only 500<span class='ja'>円</span>!  It does get quite busy, though. </p><p>If you travel a little north, near the Fukuji <span class='ja'>福地</span> area is the Okuhida Green hotel, Yakedake <span class='ja'>焼岳</span>.  It’s a bicarbonate spring, and has a beautiful emerald green bath outside to match the towering forested mountains.  Entrance is 750<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Further south in eastern Osaka are a few onsen towns.

In Shitajima, there’s Himeshaga no yu <span class='ja'>ひめしゃがの湯</span>, another bicarbonate spring facility that also contains sodium and chloride.

This is primarily a carbon dioxide spring (<i>nisanktanso</i>) <span class='ja'>二酸化炭素</span>, which lowers blood pressure by expanding blood vessels.  It also has bicarbonate, sodium, and calcium.  I love this place because it’s small and out of the way.  There are no frills.  Just 3 baths set at 42º, 40º and 21º, perfect temperatures for moving back and forth.

Their sentence is written all at once with no start or finish and words are spread throughout the circle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m53s634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m53s634.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m53s634.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m53s634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m53s634.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m57s336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m57s336.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m57s336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m57s336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h09m57s336.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h10m11s670.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h10m11s670.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h10m11s670.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h10m11s670.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-22h10m11s670.webp" /></a></p><p>As Louise continues to speak with the alien, she begins to understand and learn their language.  And through learning the language, her thought process changes, her perception of time begins to change, and she’s able to view parts of her future. Because she’s able to understand and process their language, she’s able to think like them and perceive time like them.</p><p>This is the central plot of the movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Human Examples</b></div><p>Let’s go back to our previous sentence, and compare it with some other languages.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.<br/>Je marche à l'école tous les jours.<br/>Yo camino a la escuela todos los dias.<br/>Ich gehe taglich zur Schule.</code></p><p>There’s English, French, Spanish, and German.  Each has its own sound and ring, but the basic sentence structure is the same.  I walk.  Je marche.  Yo camino.  Ich gehe.</p><p>The very first thing we care about in the sentence is "who" followed immediately by "what is he/she/it doing."  After that, everything else is details.</p><p>I think this is because our culture, personalities, and attitudes tend to be very direct.  Or we tend to favor people and ideas that are very direct.  If we can quickly and succinctly communicate the who/what and it’s action, we can understand the idea faster and fuller.</p><p>So, how does this compare with Japanese.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は毎日学校に歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>First is the subject (<span class='ja'>私</span> <i>watashi</i> or I), but the verb is the very last thing in the sentence (<span class='ja'>行きます</span> <i>ikimasu</i> go).  All of the other details are explained before the actual actions.  I think this is because Japanese language and culture tends to be indirect a lot of the time.</p><p>The Japanese teacher in class went on to give some examples of indirectness in Japanese, such as refusing an invitation.  In English, when refusing an invitation, we typically say something like, "Sorry, I can’t" or "I’m busy," and then maybe followed by a reason.  The refusal can be softer, but typically the first thing we say is very direct, "I can’t."</p><p>In Japanese, such directness could be considered rude or harsh, so the polite way to refuse is to be more indirect.  "Sorry.  On that day, I’ll be out of town"  or "Sorry, I already have another engagement on that day."  There’s no real reason to say "I can’t" because it’s implied, and because of that those harsh words are never said.</p><div class='title'><b>Switching Brains</b></div><p>As long as I’ve been learning Japanese, people have always mentioned the idea that they’re able to "switch their brain" when fully immersed in Japanese.  They claim they think in Japanese and speaking Japanese becomes more natural to them.  Sometimes they need to stop for a second to switch from talking in one language to the other.  </p><p>This idea is the foundation behind the plot of <b>Arrival</b>.  Louise can change switch her brain when communicating in the alien language, and then be able to perceive her current and future memories at a single time.</p><p>This has never been the case for me.  Over these last 4 years of living here, and 15 years since first learning Japanese, I’ve really just maintained a single mode of thought.  My thought process always tends to translate and interpret the incoming Japanese into something I can understand.  Outgoing, too, has a quick translation from English to Japanese.</p><p>Though, this single mode of thought has changed and been molded over time by all the language and culture I’ve absorbed and learned by living here.  For certain kinds of grammar and vocabulary, I can say them pretty fast.  It just feels more instinctual rather than a complete switch.  Through practice, I feel like I’ve simply trained my brain rather than developed something completely separate.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mihakayama 見量山" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mihakayama">Mihakayama 見量山</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I had another mountain on my list of places to climb, and the day was still short since Funayama took a whole lot less time to climb than I thought it would.</p><p>I had lightly researched Mihakayama, so I knew where to start.  Mihakayama is the near the on-ramp for the highway.  Actually, part of the highway tunnels through the south end of the mountain.  The trail begins further up than that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail starts as an old service road for vehicles, but soon deteriorates from age and neglect.  At one point, the two tire tracks become a single trail no longer meant for vehicles.  And you become even more engulfed in the forest.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the climb continues, fallen trees cover the path.  The path itself is covered and hidden underneath the leaves of the other trees.  The trail is rather manageable, but there were some steep parts of the trail where I slipped because of the abundance of leaves.</p><p>The climb was separated into two parts.  The first part was the direct ascent from the parking space up the side of the mountain.  At the top of the spine, was a small camp site.  From there, the trail continued on the spine of the mountain until it reached the peak.  The trail alternated from facing west to facing east.</p><p>From the west, you could clearly see Kiyomi basking in the sun.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Facing east, the rest of Takayama started to become more and more clear.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the most, this was really the best the view could offer.

We had no idea what it was.  I went to Google Maps, switched it to satellite mode, and started looking around.  It was to the right of the Arkopia ski hill, and little further back behind the mountain.  Given that Arkopia was south-south-west from us, this structure was further in that direction.  We were able to find it, but there weren’t any labels.  <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.039206,137.230641" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.039206,137.230641">Here it is</a>.

We drove around a little bit to try and find the Mahikari shrine.  There was a gate entrance complete with security guards.  We had to sign in before we could drive to the shrine, after which we had a security tail.  When we reached the parking lot, we were met with another security guard that wouldn’t let us out of their site.  We could not take photos, but we were able to see the shrine up close.</p><p>After that, we went to the Arkopia ski hill, which was another location we saw from Takatawayama.  Looking past the ski lodge, we could see the peak, where we had been an hour earlier.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, it was a really great hike.</p><table><tr><td>?:??</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parking Spot</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825">36°03'01.6"N 137°18'06.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Right-Split Rock <span class='ja'>右折れ岩</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Godzilla’s Spine <span class='ja'>ゴジラの背</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Observation Point</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.053908, 137.312544" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.053908, 137.312544">36°03'14.1"N 137°18'45.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parking Spot</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825">36°03'01.6"N 137°18'06.6"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tengaizan 天蓋山" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tengaizan">Tengaizan 天蓋山</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 10, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><i>March 16th, 2018</i></p><p>Tengaizan had been on my bucket list of Hida mountains to climb for quite a while.  I read about it on the <a href="http://hidamoriaruki.com/map/tengai/" title="http://hidamoriaruki.com/map/tengai/">Hida-mori-aruki</a> website a while ago.  I had also seen the entrance every time I went to Yama-no-mura to do the half marathon up there.  I was waiting for some nice weather and a day free from work or kendo, and that day finally happened in October 2016.</p><p>Yama-no-mura is pretty far away from central Takayama, though.  First, you need to drive to Kamioka.  That’s about 45 minutes.  And then Yama-no-mura is another 30 or 45 minutes from there.</p><p>The weather was nice, but it was the day after it rained, so the ground was rather soft and moist.  The trees reflected this, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were several steep areas of the hike where I had to use the rope to make the climb.  The hike wasn’t too long, but still took about an hour and a half to reach the summit from the parking area.  The first clear area was the Doruiato Ranch site, which was a 200m climb from the base, and about 370m up from where I parked.  I guess this flat area used to be a ranch back in the day?  It’s a bit high for horses.  Maybe they were ranching something else?</p><p>From the ranch, the rest of the trail ran along the ridge of the connecting mountains, and then went up to the peak of Tengaizan.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The peak offered a 360 view of the surrounding mountains.  But, since the morning, clouds had begun to come in and over the surrounding mountains.

Climbing steep terrain can be pretty easy, but descending puts a lot of stress on the knees and calves.  I slipped once or twice, too.

Not too bad.  At the entrance to the hiking trails was a restaurant that served meals to rejuvenate hikers from their long day.  I had ramen made from local vegetables and other ingredients.</p><p>As I departed Yama-no-mura going to Kamioka, the surrounding clouds thickened and started to choke the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7033.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7033_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7033_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7033_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From the peak of Tengaizan, I saw something buildings (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6896.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6896.webp">here</a>) that looked pretty official.  I looked on my phone, and it appeared to be Kamioka High School, but I wasn’t quite sure.  When reaching the bottom of the road leading to Yama-no-mura, I took a right and started going to Kamioka to try and find these buildings.</p><p>I took a little bit of searching around, but I was able to find them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are marked on Google Maps, but I was sure if these buildings were what I saw from the mountain peak.  Seeing them up close confirmed that they were indeed.</p><p>It’s not conveniently located, though.  Any students that actually attend this school would have to live up here.  It didn’t seem like any dormitories were around here either.  So those students would have to live in town, which was another 10 minutes away.  There was a direct road, but it was quite far for someone to walk, especially in the winter.  It seems pretty rough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tengaizan towers over Kamioka High School, but by this time, the clouds had completely covered it.

On the northwest side of the mountain, the forest is called Aokigahara <span class='ja'>青木ヶ原</span>, which translate as the Blue Tree Meadow. It's also sometimes called the Sea of Trees. The forest had grown from the hardened lava rock of the last major eruption over 1000 years ago.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The forest has another name, too: the suicide forest.</p><p>Because of the magnetism from the lava rock, compasses often don't function correctly. And because of its remoteness, cellphone signal is sometimes disrupted. This often led to people hiking or wandering off in the forest and never being heard from again. This resulted in the local people considering the forest haunted. They would say that ghosts roam the forest and claim victims of anyone traveling alone.</p><p>By the mid-2000s, people started coming to the forest to get lost and die on purpose. In 2003, apparently 105 bodies were discovered in the forest. People would kill themselves by hanging or drug overdose. The forest was quite infamous for suicide because of this, and it was labeled the "most popular" place for suicide in Japan. Later in 2018, it would get even more acclaim when Logan Paul came here, and posted his video of finding a dead man hanged from a tree.</p><p>In order to prevent yourself from getting lost, hiking trails are lined with rope and markers to keep you on the trail and guide you back to the start. If you go off into the forest outside of the trail, you are supposed to bring your own flags to mark your trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558_t.webp" /></a></p><p>My friends Fishy and Chaos came to visit me in Japan, and we went here as one of our last places on the vacation. We didn't bring any markers, but we also didn't really venture all that far into the forest. The forest was so huge, there really weren't any major trail heads. Everywhere looked identical.</p><p>As we drove along Route 71, eventually we found something that looked like a place to park and a cleared path into the woods.</p><p>I had a done a far amount of hiking in my 3 years of living in Takayama, but this forest had a much different atmosphere than those mountain woods. These forests don't really get a lot of snow or cold weather, so the moss and overgrowth completely covered anything on the ground. The trees shot up into the sky and created a near solid canopy that blocked out much of the sun. (As such, many of my photos are totally washed out.)</p><p>After moving into the forest far enough, it really did feel like an ocean of trees. Every direction felt the same. You could truly get lost without a sense of direction.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail we followed eventually led to a break in the canopy, and the sunlight shone down on a single carpet of grass.</p><p>We stayed for a moment, and then went back to the car. We found another trail down the road leading up into the mountain, but it had become late afternoon, and there was still a lot more driving left for the night.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Apr 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghibli Expo at Roppongi Hills" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghibli-expo-at-roppongi-hills">Ghibli Expo at Roppongi Hills</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
