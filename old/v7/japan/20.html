| May 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm a pretty lazy person.  I've had 2 months since I purchased airline tickets for Japan, but I still waited until the night before to do everything.  On Wednesday Night, I bought better insoles for my shoes, packed clothing, packed other stuff, paid rent, processed all my old photos still on my camera, watched Rescue Me.  I could have easily done this stuff on Tuesday, but decided to wait for I don't know why.</p><p>As such I got to bed around Midnight.  I wanted to get a good night's rest before my 8am flight, but It was not in the cards.  I had to wake up around 5:15am and get outside to catch a bus at 5:52 to head to the airport.  A transfer here, a transfer there, and I was at the airport.  A timely arrival didn't really matter though, since Chicago thunderstorms delayed my flight out of Madison about 2 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>O'hare</b></div><p>Eventually, I made it to Chicago with well enough time to catch my Narita flight.  So much time, in fact, that I walked around the airport.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3119.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3119.webp" /></p><p>O'hare has some very pretty areas that I hadn't seen before.  Usually what I see of O'hare is construction, or concrete walls.  The International flight areas is really pretty.  The corridor connecting Terminals B and C is underground and has rainbow lights that flicker along to classical music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3111.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3111.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3118.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3118.webp" /></p><p>Going back and forth along the conveyer belts took up enough of my free time.  I boarded the plane, sat in my seat, and off we went to Narita.  I choose the very last window seat on the left side of the plane: 61B.  Which was great in theory.  There was no one behind me to kick my seat!  However, directly behind me was a semi-open area for people to stand and stretch.  So I only slept a couple times, and 20 minutes at time for that matter.</p><p>The pilot was pretty efficient.  We got to Narita 20 minutes ahead of schedule!  However, that didn't make any difference.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita</b></div><p>The Japanese Health Administration was set into Panic mode thanks to the Swine Flu and EVERY incoming human to Japan had to be "Quarantined".  We sat on the plane for an additional 2 hours after our 12 hour flight for Health officials to board the plane and have us take an additional customs survey about our health.</p><p>One-by-one passenger-by-passenger they would receive our survey process it and then decide that we're OK.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3127.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3127.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3127.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3131.webp" /></p><p>Surprisingly, the people on the plane were understanding, despite the ridiculousness.  Everyone sat in their seat and waited.  I was probably the only one on the plane that didn't have a connecting flight, too.  We arrived at Narita around 2:20pm and I finally got off the plane around 4:15pm.  It's been about 21 hours since I've got any actual sleep.</p><div class='title'><b>Shibuya</b></div><p>The Narita Express took me directly to Shibuya where I plan on staying for my whole trip.  The second that I got off the train I started walking in the direction I thought was correct but was not.  I joked that I was totally get lost walking around Tokyo, but I didn't think I would get lost so early in my Journey.  Once I found a city map, I was turned toward the right direction.</p><p>The Hotel I planned on staying at was actually a Love Hotel.  I guess that's what I get for last minute research.  There was an actual hotel right around the corner though.  So I checked in, got in my room and finally went to sleep around 7:30pm (24 hours since I woke up at 5:15am in Madison).<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The rest of the trip" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-rest-of-the-trip">The rest of the

| April 12, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The last couple days of our trip to Japan consisted of shopping around to various locations rather than the sight-seeing fair we've been doing nearly the entire trip so far.</p><div class='title'><b>Hamanomachi</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0477.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0477.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0477.webp" /></p><p>For our last full day in Nagasaki, we started shopping downtown.  There was quite a bit that had changed downtown I wasn't really expecting.  For example, the You-Ing, which used to be on the corner downtown had moved into the prime 6 floor location of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0474.webp">Hamanomachi</a>.  It looked like the whole downtown area right outside Hamanomachi was going through some huge changes, too.  It'll probably look completely different in another year.</p><p>As luck would have it, it was Thursday, April 10th, which meant Mario Kart Wii had just come out. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" /></p><p>You-Ing had far more than just those copies and I bet they were completely sold out by Saturday.</p><p>Another big change was that the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp">Sega World</a> was no longer in business.  It don't know how they could've gone out of business, when the place was packed everytime I went there.  There was no sign on the door saying the moved locations either.  Weird...</p><div class='title'><b>More shopping and arcades</b></div><p>After taking a look at some of the other arcades and a couple more stores, we made our way to You-Me Saito and Amu Plaza and tried our luck, unsuccessfully, at some crane games.  Later on, we made it to Taito and found a new Konami Shmup!  It's called Otomedius, another parody spin-off of the Gradius series.  Here's a few pics of the machine (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0480.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0480.webp">here</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0481.webp">here</a>).  The screen was very high-res and featured a couple touch options too.  There was a dude playing it though, and those crane games were a little more appealing for the moment, so I didn't play it.  It looked like it played A LOT like parodius though.</p><p>It looked like it could've been fun though...  I'll look it up on wikipedia later.</p><div class='title'><b>Beardo</b></div><p>For the rest of the evening, we returned to Beardo to hang out with Sachi, Yoriko and Nonoka. ^_^.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" /></p><p>And we also proceeded to drink heavily.  Throughout the night, several of the newly initiated JASIN students arrived and we got a chance to talk to them about Japan.  It was really kinda weird though..  It's like watching a new Season of Survivor with a completely new cast of people, when you're totally used to the previous season.</p><p>Kraig Henry showed up again, and began giving the students the run down, more or less.  The students that hung out with us were from New York state, Southern Illinois, La Crosse, WI, Manchester, England, North North England, and France.</p><p>As the night grew thin, we started passing out and had to return to our beds.  We said goodbye to everyone for the evening, but we met up with the Hiro family the next day for lunch. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Friday</b></div><p>For lunch, we went to one of those restaurants on 5th floor Amu.  After lunch, we lost track of time a little bit, and had to run to catch our train back to Fukuoka.  Gage and I ran down to the ticket counter and bought our tickets, while Sachi and Yoriko made it downstairs with Nonoka and Nanase.  The bought some local tickets, so they could say goodbye to us on the platform.  We hopped on the train, and waved goodbye to them just outside as the doors closed.  I sat down in a window seat where they could see me, and continued waving to them.  They even started running after the train a little bit when it took off, it was so sweet ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>Fukuoka</b></div><p>Early in the day, while waiting for Sachi, I emailed Aya since I knew she lived around Fukuoka and made some plans to hang out with her for the rest of the evening.  She actually lived a little further away than I thought she did, but it was still considered in Fukuoka, which was weird.  Her train ride was about an hour to get downtown, whereas our train ride from Nagasaki was about 1 hour 45 minutes.</p><p>Anywho, we finally met up with her and went over to Tenjin to do some more shopping and arcading.  We found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0492.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0492.webp">plenty</a> of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0493.webp">engrish</a> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0494.webp">shirts</a> and played plenty of crane games.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0496.webp" /></p><p>But, like our whole trip, time began to fade and we had to say goodbye.  She needed to get back home and we needed sleep for our 7:00 AM flight the next day.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0497.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0497.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080411_fukuoka/IMG_0497.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Some TV</b></div><p>Well, we didn't quite make it to bed right away.  Gage wrote up a couple of emails and I watched some TV.  There was a very interesting program on which started off talking about Otaku and Akihabara but blended into Russian-Japanese fandom.  This Japanese otaku flew to Russia and met up with his friend for a tour of this fandom.  They started off with "Bloom", which is some big Russian Cosplay organization, i think?</p><p>They also went around to several Japanese restaurants.  The first of which was a sushi place called Yakitori.  The otaku thought it was odd that the place didn't even have any Yakitori, yet that's what they named the place.  The sushi chef was a roll with very creamy cream cheese, some green onions and some kind of fish that looked like tuna.  The otaku was rather stunned at the cream cheese addition, but was full-out surprised when after the sushi roll was rolled, they deep-fried it in Tempura.  It looked really really good actually, but not to the Japanese.  It looked like he was just being polite when he said "oishii".</p><p>They didn't go into as much detail with other restaurants than to simple make fun of their names.  One restaurant had some kanji on the sign which was missing a stroke.  This really seemed like the exact same "making fun of" us Americans do when we see/read Engrish shirts.  It was always wondering if the Japanese had something similar to that and I guess they do. ^_^  The same type of thing was we quite tattoos with some kanji.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita</b></div><p>The morning came quite fast, and we darted from bed into a cab and then into the airplane.  We had a 7 hour lay-over in Narita and since our luggage was already loaded onto our next flight, we did a little exploring to Narita.

We checked You-ing and Yamada, but found nothing.  Next we went up the street a little bit, and I showed Gage around Sumiyoshi.  But my little tour was cut short by our feet being reduced to hamburger once again.  It was around 3:00pm and we had already been on our feet since 4:00am.</p><p>We caught a bus and went down to 100 yen sushi.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080407_nagasaki/IMG_0390.webp" /></p><p>100 yen sushi is a rotating sushi restaurant, which kinda like a buffet.  Plates move around the restaurant on a conveyer belt and you just pick up whatever you like.  Each plate is 100 yen, so you eat as much or as little as you like.</p><p>After giving our feet a little rest we went to Yamada in Togitsu, Hard off and Geo and finally found things I was looking for.  I picked up the PSP GPS for $54, the Map pack for $10, Railfan on PS3 for $30, and found some more Capsule toys.</p><p>We finished off the day by visiting Beardo, which was great ^_^.  Nonoka is still really cute, and Nanase is adorable ^_^  All the regulars were there and Clinton stopped by, too.  I also met Henry, a friend of Leigh's, who is currently studying abroad.  I'll take plenty of pictures there when we go back on Thursday.</p><p>On the way back to our hotel, we stopped at Jinya to meet Ryan, who's also back in Nagasaki trying to find work or anything that'll keep him here.  It sounds like JET is a little bloated these days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mt.

I'll show Gage some of the nifty sight-seeing places like the Atomic Bomb epicenter, Peace Park, probably the Museum too.  We'll probably hit Beardo.  On Tuesday, we'll probably do more of the same but do far more shopping.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ikuko took the day off, so we'll head up to Sasebo to meet her.  I want to check out Hirado castle, which is a little north of Sasebo, and also other places around there where we could find more Sakura ^_^.  We'll spend the night in Sasebo somewhere, probably Cybac or a Karaoke box or something.  Maybe Ikuko has some room at her place.</p><p>On Thursday, we'll head back to Nagasaki but take make some stops in Towns on the way back, like Omura and Isahaya.  Hopefully, Hilary will get back to me about this Italian place, and we'll have some Pizza in Nagayo, too.</p><p>On Friday, we'll head back to Fukuoka and do much much shopping around town.  We didn't really spend a lot of time in stores yesterday, so this'll be the day to make up for that.</p><p>Early Saturday morning is our flight back to the states. :/</p><p>There you have it ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mitsuwa's Bon Odori Festival" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mitsuwas-bon-odori-festival">Mitsuwa's Bon Odori Festival</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, Mitsuwa had their annual Bon Odori Dancing festival.  The Bon festival is typically the festival of the dead that which citizens remember their loved ones.  Nagasaki has a pretty elaborate Bon festival that spans 3 days.  One of the shrines from Suwa Shrine is brought down to the Harbor where it is clearly visible for the spirits to gather and collect amongst the living.  Loved ones can go to the Harbor and see their loved ones who had died over the past year.  On the third day, loved ones light a candle in a little paper boat and send it down the river to guide the spirit through the River Styx.</p><p>Something like that anyways..  This was one festival, I wish I was still over there to see.  Bon festivals take place towards the end of Summer.  Typically sometime between the end of July and the beginning of September.  Nagasaki's Bon festival takes place in the middle of august.  Around the same time, St. Paul, Minnesota also celebrates Nagasaki's Bon festival, since they are "sister cities," which makes it a great excuse to go home and visit my parents.</p><p>Anywho.. Mitsuwa changes this a little bit by adding 'Odori', which is 'to dance.' Mitsuwa's Bon Odori festival was more of the celebration of life, than the remembrance of the dead.  I wonder what region this change originated from.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" /></p><p>Mitsuwa had a pretty damn big turnout.  It reminded me a lot of our school's festival in Japan, but with a lot less participation.  Mitsuwa had a larger turnout with less to do.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0041.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0042.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0042.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0042.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0043.webp" /></p><p>Inside was pretty packed too.  Several stands were setup showcasing some of Japanese greatest festival food items, such as Okunomiyaki and Yakisoba..  No squid on a stick, though :/</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" /></p><p>The real show was the stage outside in the parking lot.  They switched off between traditional japanese stuff, and uninspired contests.  They had Chicago's professional Taiko Drummasters, and Chicago's Okinawan dancers.</p><p>I was really disappointed they didn't have Soran and Yosakoi.  These were the two traditional dances that Maki, Mika, Natchan, and Mayu taught us foreigners.  Perhaps, in one years time, I will assembled a Soran team of my own and bring this time honored tradition to Mitsuwa.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun.  It was really cute to see so many kids having a great time, and it was great seeing everyone in a festival type mood.</p><p>They really need more food vendors and parlor games to bring the essence of a japanese festival to life, though.  I guess too many people have real jobs.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Amperos" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/amperos">Amperos</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Fucking Amperos.. yet another late night venture ruined by insecurity</p><p>Amperos is an 8 story all-girls dormatory which lies at the bottom of the mountain that Gaidai sits atop of. Gaidai being short for Nagasaki Gaigokokugo Daigaku, which is japanese for Nagasaki Foreign Language University. Through some sorrid twist of fate, they put the girls dormatory right next to the school, but the guys dorm is a mile or two away.</p><p>One year, some guy started harassing some girls and tried to break in through the front. I mean, come on.. who wouldn't right? So, they erected a 7 foot fence circling the perimeter to keep the old perverts out of there.</p><p>That wasn't enough for another old guy, since he just went over the fence and then was free to harass. Steps had to be taken.. They lined their 1 foot thick concrete fences with 2 inter-weaving lines of barbed wire. But only along the landlocked portion of the perimeter.</p><p>Since Amperos is near the bottom of the mountain, its' north side hugs the road the continues up the mountain to gaidai. This has been easy to climb up and jump over before. The south face over looks the mountain as it continues down into a ravine. The drop is about 5 or 6 stories into the runoff river below. So, they must've figured that no one would get in that way.</p><p>This was still an invitation for some guys, who have tried to scale that muddy rock wall to reach the fence and climb right on in. I don't know if they put barbed wire along the south wall yet.</p><p>I think all this over security just breeds challenge for those uninvited. Its not possible to ever be 100% secure. The illusion of all this safety really just puts a big spotlight on yourself.</p><p>Anyways, needless to say, they are pretty strict about the 'girls only' rule. Each person entering the building is greeted by an orderly who stands watch during the hours when Amperos is open. Girls must return to Amperos by 10p or 11p depending on the night or else they are locked out for the evening. I guess they can't pay someone to be at the post 24 hours.</p><p>This whole thing really screws them over when they want to go out for the night to a bar and drink until whenever they've had enough. More over, it screws up a guys night when he wants his friends to join him at beardo. Much like last night.. Of course, the night probably would've been fine if i still had a room at the guy's dorm :/.. oh well</p><p>This is how last night ended.. Hoping a bus back downtown to five's place, getting some sleep and watching Fugitive 2 on the movie channel.</p><p>Overall yesterday was quite fun. I met up with mennat, natalie, miho and tina for dinner. 3 of which live in Amperos.</p><p>I ran into a couple random friends, too. A chinese guy from the forms and a chinese girl from the dance club. Both pretty surprised to see me. My chinese pal's first words to me, after asking why i was here was, "wahh, you're fat".. thank you.. at least someone said what had been on my mind for the past couple weeks. "Americans like to eat a lot of meat," he said, "its so cheap." I love non-westerner simplistic honesty..</p><p>"yeah.. that and i hardly get any exercise, eat fast-food a little too often, and have been developing a fatty recipe for about two months," i replied. Hmm... well there are 3 easy things i can change about my current lifestyle right off the bat.</p><p>Maybe i'll also try utilizing Madison's metro system as an excuse to use my legs for a change. Then again, i'll probably get back and just say fuck it. Its earie how easy it is to be lazy in America. If fast food was healthier, in general, the whole population would start to become just a little bit healthier, in general. It sucks, because all the healthy food in America either tastes bad, takes preparation, or too expensive. Blah blah blah..</p><p>Yesterday also marked plenty of video game shopping. Almost too much, actually..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Back to Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/back-to-japan">Back to Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
