I'm a pretty independent person, so i thought living in the dormatory would give me more freedom then being tied down to a family.  Also, they refund $300 a month from your tuition and it gave other people a chance for a family.  I'm pretty happy with it.  Here's the dorm:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060920_dorm_school/DSC03059.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060920_dorm_school/DSC03059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060920_dorm_school/DSC03059.webp" /></p><p>It's pretty freakin' dank.

The showers are all the way downstairs, but are usually empty in the morning.  The japanese like to go to bed clean, rather than start the day clean.</p><p>The dorm is a bit out of the way though.  It takes about 30 minutes to walk to school, and about 10 minutes to the nearest market or convience store.  The Bus rolls by the front of the dorm all the time, but i really don't like spending $2 a ride.  I think that's what has been eating up my money the most.</p><p>There are a few bars though.

Today i had the choice between walking around to various beautiful shrines in downtown nagasaki and catch a few game stores i found off google while i was at it, or climb the huge mountain outside of the window that had been staring me down all week.  It kept taunting me.  It was all like, "i'm a mountain.  that's right.  uh uh, yeah i got it.  now, whatcha gonna do?"  Today was the last straw, "oh i'll show you what imma gonna do, mountain."</p><p>So i made way towards the rocky green beast..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02680.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02680.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02680.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02685.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02685.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02685.webp" /></p><p>man... five's neighborhood is so pretty.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02687.webp" /></p><p>There it is again, taunting me, as i crossed the nagasaki river.  The hills were trecherous and the signs were helpful.  As i continued through the local neighborhood, one particular sign stated, "Mt. Inasa this way (4.2km)."  Oh good lord..  4.2 km?!  That's like 2 1/2 miles.  This wasn't really such a leisurely stroll at this point..  I went into the local convience and bought myself some delicious onigiri to empower myself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02688.webp" /></p><p>Though, i was making progress.  I was getting to the point where i was at about eye level with five's apartment.  I soon came across a really nice looking <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02696.webp">house</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02688.webp" /></p><p>It's seemed pretty authentic, like one of those shrines i've been in before.  Except this was actually someone's home, so i didn't really poke around too much.  The road up ahead curved up and around the mountain.  The curve overlooked a graveyard, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02729.webp">which overlooked Nagasaki</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02731.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02731.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02731.webp" /></p><p>The graveyard's of Nagasaki are rather.. scenic and located on hills.  I suppose the japanese originally began burying their dead here, and as time went and as the city expanded, it had to conform to the graves which had already been filled.  It reminds me of platteville.</p><p>As i got further up the mountain, I came across some damage from the typhoon..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02733.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02733.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02733.webp" /></p><p>This poor guy's house or garage fell victim to the awesome winds.

I was nearing as Nagasaki was deminishing.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02795.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02795.webp" /></p><p>It was rather <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02808.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02808.webp">nature-ful</a>.  The road itself had plenty of trees around the edges.  My head caught a little bit of a spider's web too.  I brushed it off like normal, until i looked at my hand and saw this menacing black spider about half the size of my hand.  I tossed that thing on the ground and took off the opposite direction..  I don't care how tough you are, if you see a spider that big on your skin, you would freak out too.</p><p>five and i have had a previous discussion on japanese insects and spiders.  He said that the Japanese Wood Spider is responsible for the biggest strongest web in the entire world.  The biggest web recorded had been 2 meters in length, and as strong as cavlair.  Apparently small birds have been known to get caught in the web too.  (and) I probably had that fucker on my hand..  I wasn't going to let that stop me..</p><p>As i rounded the corner, i came across a separate path off to the left.  There was a staircase that led off into the forest.  Hmmmm....  Earlier five had mentioned a shortcut that i would find off to my left.  Hell, i'm all for shortcuts..  The road was pretty overgrown, and dumped with leaves and branches from the typhoon.   It was the old road that used to lead up the mountain before they made the current one..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02809.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02809.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02809.webp" /></p><p>Hell, i've walked through worse back in Wisconsin and Minnesota.  I'll be fine..  That was my general thought until i walked my face directly into a massive spider's web.  I fled back down that overgrown trail with my arms flailing and ripped off spider web from my face and hair.  "wahh, get it off me."  Fuck that route.  I'm taking the street.</p><p>I swear..  After today, i think Japan has turned me into a bug wuss.  here's one of those assholes i found up the hill a little bit:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02812.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02812.webp" /></p><p>__</p><p>Anyways, i had finally made it to the top of the hill, but there was still plenty of walking remaining.

I hadn't seen the other side of the mountain.  The islands and sea were quite beautiful.  So majestic.</p><p>The park was pretty spectacular.  It had a little playground, a music hall, plenty of open space, and a fricken zoo.

When i was rested and ready to go, I made way to the final couple of staircases and windy mountain roads to my final destination.

It's look like the top of the mountain was just cut off, and then the school was built.  At the base of the mountain, lies a little community nestled between the moutain, and the main Nagasaki road.  The road has several fast food places and a pretty big electronics store as well.  Behind the school's mountain is another larger community where my dorm is.</p><p>Also at the base of the moutain is the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02639.webp">girl's dormatory</a>.

In fact, five states that it actually should be considered located in the closer town, Togitsu.

Like.. past all the water.  That prominent city of that photo is Togistu.  Here's the cute little neighbor between the Nagasaki road and the school's mountain:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02650.webp" /></p><p>We decided to head back toward Nagasaki and hit the arcade..  though, this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02653.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02653.webp">green bug</a> wanted to come with.  Five and I decided to start playing Quest of D.  It was actually a bit cheaper to start playing the game.  The starter deck was $5, but it came with an ID card.  Though, it was $2 per play :/</p><p>Look at this guy's collection of cards:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02654.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02654.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02654.webp" /></p><p>You get ONE card each time you play..  unless he bought all those cards from somewhere, this guy has put more money into Quest of D than I probably have into DDR.</p><p>I went over to the vending machine and bought my starter deck: A poison dagger, a potion, a skeleton mage, and a map...  that's good right?  I actually ended up purchasing the LAST starter deck from the machine, so five was fresh out of luck.  The arcade was a bit busy though, and with all this Quest of D experts around, i didn't really want to look like a dumbass trying to figure out the game.  So, we decided to come back later sometime..</p><p>Before we left, we played some more DDR.  Simple songs, and then we ended on Paranoia Survivor..  We formed a decent crowd behind us and five overheard one of the guy's saying that i was pretty impressive ^_^.  ahahahaha.</p><p>We hopped aboard a Street Car and went back to the shopping arcade in downtown Nagasaki to check around for a cell phone.  I was a little hungry, so five recommended this Takoyaki place on the corner.  I ordered some takomeshi:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02656.webp" /></p><p>Which is Tako (Octopus) mixed/cooked into rice.  It was quite delicious ^_^.  The octopus formed perfectly with the rice.  I need to figure out how to make this stuff.  It's probably done by mixing it all together before you cook the rice.</p><p>Since we were in the shopping arcade, five took me to the anime store, which was a little dissapointing.

From previous posts: Yoshinoya is a fast food type chain of delicious rice bowl menu items.  Gyuudon is their popular beef bowl which they have been unable to serve to the public thanks to the government banning the import of Beef, which in December 2003. In July 2006, the ban was lifted, but the public were still uneasy with the beef.  Today, on September 18th, Yoshinoya has decided to bring back their beef bowl.  The would start serving them at 11am and would continue until sold out.</p><p>I had to get myself one ^_^.</p><p>As i waited for five to get ready, i walked around a bit to access more damage from yesterday's typhoon.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02557.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02557.webp" /></p><p>The top corner of this building's roof is a bit broken up..

The storm shutters were down, but the roof over the garage started coming loose and flying around.

People continued to sift through the restaurant as we waited for our food.  They were quite organized i must say.  If this was some place in america, i bet people would be pushing each other over, or being jerks to each other.  Everyone was quite polite and waited for their turn.  Our food had arrived:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02574.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02574.webp" /></p><p>It even came in it's own <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02576.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02576.webp">Beef branded bowl</a>.  It was pretty good ^_^.

If McDonald's couldn't sell the BigMac anymore for some reason, do you think this many people would line up if the brought it back for a single day?  eh..

| September 17, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Ever since my stay here in Nagasaki, we've been watching the weather and five kept showing me that we were about to get hit with a Typhoon.  Each day the typhoon came closer, and closer.  So yesterday, we picked up some food so we didn't have to go out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02389.webp" /></p><p>five recommended these Onigiri Senbei which were great..  I also FINALLY found some green tea that doesn't taste like crap:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02390.webp" /></p><p>___</p><p>Later on in the afternoon, around 3pm i suppose, the typhoon smacked Nagasaki.  There was a ton of rain, but it only lasted a little while.  The winds were fierce and battered against the trees and buildings around us:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02396.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02396.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02396.webp" /></p><p>After the rain stopped, we opened up the window to stick our heads out and see what was going on.  It was like sticking your head out a car door window when you're driving down the highway.  I took some pictures: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02404.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02404.webp">one</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02429.webp">two</a>.  It was pretty crazy.  Frequently, plastic bags would just shoot on by the window.  You could see things knocked down in the streets below.  Every once in a while, we'd see some ceramic tiles fly on by and smack into the ground or the roof of another house.  Also occasionally, you'd see a huge surge of light and a bunch of sparks..</p><p>It had to die down eventually though:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02442.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02442.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02442.webp" /></p><p>We were in a pretty unique location, nestled in a little valley between mountains..  The mountain would absorb alot of the storm, and when it reached the Valley, the wind would blow the storm away..  You can see the mountains in the distance eating up the storm:</p><p class='img'><img

While waiting for five to get ready i got a stroll around the block to check out the elementary school.  It was closed since it was saturday, but i still took a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02013.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02013.webp">shot</a> from on top of the staircase leading to the back of the school.

There are tons of back paths, and alley ways that are all publically acceptable to walk along.  Usually if you come across a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02069.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02069.webp">stair case</a> with a bunch of white paint on the edges, it'll lead to another neighbor or block of houses rather than a single house.  It's a pretty good indicator ^_^, though i think they do that so you can see the steps at night easier.</p><p>here's the road that goes past the front of five's apartment building:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02072.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02072.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02072.webp" /></p><p>It's so narrow, yet people fly by in their cars or moped's at around 30 mph, when the speed limit clearly says 20km (12mph).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02074.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02074.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02074.webp" /></p><p>zoom zoom..</p><p>i went back to the apartment to see if five was ready..  then we took off.

The front door is open a little bit as well, and it's just completely full of garbage.  It seems like the type of place that would be abandoned, but there's a bike out front, so someone is obviously in there.  There was a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02093.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02093.webp">stray kitty</a> sitting on the bike.</p><p>Continuing along, there's also some neat little thing to take a picture of..  like this <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02098.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02098.webp">drainage system</a> that goes back down to the river, or just the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02099.webp">corner</a> of the street.

The meter will keep track of the time.  When you come back it'll tell you how much you owe.  When you pay the meter, your car is released and you may leave.</p><p>Anywho.. we took the street car to the end of the Nagasaki blvd, back to where the Nagasaki school is located.  This is the area i'll be hanging out at quite a bit.  Here's their local shopping arcade:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02116.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02116.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02116.webp" /></p><p>We went to the japanese dollar store, so i could find a little coin purse to hold my change.  They had a bunch of useful crap, like kana magnets.

They had the whole series of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02142.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02142.webp">Akira</a> for a cheap $130 and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02143.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02143.webp">this game</a> which i have no idea how to play.</p><p>Next up, we went the local arcade.  Five showed me the huge <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02144.webp">Virtual Fighter 5</a> arcade units.  They also had this massive <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02149.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02149.webp">Soccer game</a>:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02151.webp" /></p><p>Apparently you play using a deck of cards.  You play your team on the playing field, and move your cards around to where you want your players to go.  This game supports 8 players, and shows highlights on the big screen in front of everyone.  Very extravagent.</p><p>__</p><p>Five showed me another game which i found QUITE interesting. It's called Quest of D, and here's <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02155.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02155.webp">some guy</a> playing it.  It's a fantasy adventure type game, that plays a bit like diablo, but it also uses a card system.  To even begin playing Quest of D, you must purchase an ID card to save your character.. that's about $5.  Then you must need to buy a starter deck of items, which is about $4.  Then you need to create your character which costs one credit, or $1.  That's $10 to start the game, and you haven't even played yet.  They have a separate machine for creating a character.</p><p>Once you've created your character, and you're set to go.  Then you can plop your down on a real machine, like that guy was on.  You need to insert cards from your starter deck into the machine which can be used as items.  You get potions, armor, weapons, etc this way.  You'll get a menu where you build your inventory for the upcoming quest and take items from your deck and place them on your person.</p><p>Once item selection is complete, it's time for the quest.  For each quest you're given an objective and a dungeon to complete that objective in.  You can take on the quest alone, with a friend, or you can do net play and team up with 3 others from across Japan.</p><p>The controls are pretty simple.  You have a joystick for movement, and buttons for attacking.  The display is a touch screen, and you touch the screen to use items, move around items, pick up loot from killing creatures, opening up treasure chests, and a few other things.</p><p>When you defeat levels, the game will spit out booster packs of cards for you.  You can also buy booster packs for your deck as well.</p><p>Very interesting...  i'll probably start playing it once i get settled in my dorm room.  Though, i can see this getting rather pricey.  I might set myself a limit from the beginning, like $25 max, and then see where i'm at when i get to that limit.</p><p>Quest of D is made and distributed by Sega and looks like it runs off the Xbox arcade board.  Here's a pic of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02157.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02157.webp">card vending machine</a>.  (it's in the middle).<br/>___</p><p>We went off the beaten path a little bit, and five took me to a couple of touristy sights.</p><p>First up was the Torii Arch of the Sanno Shinto Shrine:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02168.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02168.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02168.webp" /></p><p>The arch once stood tall as the entrance to the Sanno Shinto Shrine, but was blow slightly apart when the Atomic Bomb hit Nagasaki.  When you walk up to this Arch, it's actually turns a bit slightly from the blast, which partially led to it's topple.  The rest lay against the wall down the sidewalk a little bit.</p><p>Continuing along the path was the new Sanno Shinto Shrine built on the site of the old one after it was blown away.  Here's a panorama of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02187.webp">entrance way</a>..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02192.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02192.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02192.webp" /></p><p>At the top of these steps are the famous Camphor trees of the Sanno Shinto Shrine, which survived the atomic blast as well.  Here's a panaroma of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02200.webp">right tree</a>.  Most of the tree's bark was completely stripped off from the force of the bomb.  The exposed areas of the tree were painted black to prevent them from rotting, and stand as a symbol of perserverence and a shrine to those who were killed.

Another plaque stated that after the blast, when people drank from the river they would collapse and die from the amount of poison that water had obtained..  So many japanese died from the river..  So many corpses would be washed down the river and brought into the Nagasaki bay.  Eventually the river was so littered with corpses that it formed a damn of rotting flesh..  "it was hell on earth," some guy said..  Once people realized the danger, everyone became afraid of drinking water..  many also died of thirst because they were too afraid of getting poisoned..<br/>__</p><p>Anyways...  we continued along and found another little <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02256.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02256.webp">niche arcade</a>.

Around the corner was another little shrine, that was built in the 60s to commerate those who have died in, for and were effected by the blast of Nagasaki.<br/>Nagasaki is really quite an amazing place.  The city itself is so rich in history, but it's set within a culture that is quite connected to it's age-old traditional routes.  Everything just has this deep rich aura to it that just completely escapes me.  It's magical my friend... lemme tell you. ^_^</p><p>___</p><p>Anyways, we made our way back to the strip for shopping primarily.  We came across a used book stores that had some porno visible from the window.  It also had some used DS games, so we had to take a look.

I did, however, find a used copy of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02326.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02326.webp">Bible Black</a> though.</p><p>Around the corner and past the bridge was the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02330.webp">north-side You-Ing</a>.

They couldn't sustain the purcahse, even though they are pretty cheap at around $20 each.</p><p>After spending about an hour in You-ing, we made our way to the electronics store for a power cord and some delicious food as well.  We found a yakitori stand on the way there:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02350.webp" /></p><p>It was pretty cheap at 80c each, so i picked up some ã­ã?ã¾ and ã?¢ã?¢ã?¿ã?¬.  The ã?¢ã?¢ã?¿ã?¬ was absolutely delicious.  It tasted exactly like bbq ribs.  MMmmmmMmmMMmmMMmmmm....</p><p>We got the power cord before dinner.  It signed up for a Point Card at the same time, which five recommended since this in my neighborhood near the university.  For those who don't know, most large electronics stores have a Point Card system that will award you credit at their store.  You get a certain percentage of your purcahse back on your card, and you can use points to pay for your purchase.  Also, they have little contests and games to award yourself points on your card to spend at the store.  It's their way of hooking you as a customer, so that you keep spending your points back in the store rather than going elsewhere.</p><p>Afterwards i finally had some of Nagasaki's famous champon noodles:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02356.webp" /></p><p>It was so good..  very delicious.</p><p>___</p><p>Afterwards, we decided to go downtown..  like downtown downtown, to the bar areas..  though, five was getting a bit sleepy, so once we got off the street car, we went to starbucks..
