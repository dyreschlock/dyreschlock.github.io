| April 13, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Recently I finished putting together the Pocket Camera Plus for the Gameboy. This takes all of the original hardware of the GameBoy Camera and puts it into a shell that you can attach actual Camera lens. You can read more about here: <a href="/old/v7/gameboy-camera-plus" title="/gameboy-camera-plus">/gameboy-camera-plus</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" /></p><p>Attached to the Pocket Camera Plus, I'm using a pretty generic and bare bones Zoom lens. I just bought whatever was cheapest on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">Amazon</a>. It has manually focus, zoom, and aperture, and has a focus length of 6mm up to 60mm. I guess that means it has a 10x zoom. Each of the rings has a pin used for movement, but these pins can be screwed in to keep the current setting.</p><p>In addition to the manual settings of the lens, the GameBoy Camera game has a Contrast and Brightness setting. Contrast is very important to reduce the harsh lights and darks coming into the camera. There is some automatic brightness control that the camera already does. This makes the manual aperture nearly useless. And even the digital brightness settings in the game can get overridden by the software trying to autocorrect the brightness.</p><p>For the following photos, I really only used the manual Zoom and Focus, and digital Contrast when taking photos.</p><p>Anyway, with my Pocket Camera and regular Camera, I went around town throughout the weekend and tested it out.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakurano Park <span class='ja'>桜野公園</span></b></div><p>It's Spring in Takayama, so the Cherry Blossoms are in full boom. One of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Takayama is northwest of the main town. On the way to Kokufu, Sakurano Park is off to the side of the highway on the other side of the river. It's the perfect place to have a picnic on a warm Spring afternoon while viewing the cherry blossoms. (Although, this Spring has been freezing with the occasional snow)</p><p>I took some photos in late evening as the sun was setting.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div

incredible amount of flexibility when taking photos. No matter how close or how far away from the subject, the zoom allows you to frame the photo and the focus allows you to get all of the detail. The sensor itself is still primitive by only allowing 4 colors, but you can still get a ton of clarity.</p><p>Of course, photos are best taken when the subject is clearly light. If there is no strong light source, then it can be hard to squeeze out detail. 4 colors can only do so much.</p><div class='title'><b>Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span></b></div><p>The next day, I went to Shiroyama Park downtown and took a few more photos.

Kouge <span class='ja'>工芸</span> is Japanese for crafts, such as pottery, woodworking, and any other profession that designs and creates materials and works. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" /></a></p><p>20 Japanese artisans and craftsmen, from young to old, were challenged with how they could incorporate Pokemon into their works. How could they make something that could display the essence of a Pokemon, whether it be through their appearance, gestures, or traces of gameplay through trading, evolving, or battling? How would a particular Pokemon's personality or history clash or match with traditional crafts? With these questions and ideas, they have created over 70 original works displayed in this exhibit.</p><p>Here's the website: <a href="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/" title="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/">https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/</a></p><p>Also, here's the exhibit brochure:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing"> https://drive.google.com/.../15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK</a></p><p>A friend sent me a link to this exhibit. I had seen a link about it before, but I didn't realize it was in Kanazawa. So close! I thought it was in Tokyo, or Osaka, or something. So, I went there on Thursday March 30th and arrived around 11:30am. There was a line to enter, but I only had to wait 20 minutes. Not too bad for a Thursday. They had reservation tickets available, which would probably be necessary on weekends. Individual tickets were 900<span class='ja'>円</span>. You can buy tickets online, too.</p><p>The exhibit was divided into three sections: Appearance, Stories, and Life. All of my photos are included at the bottom.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>すがたーせまる</span>！ Appearance - Approach!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first room were works inspired by the appearance of the Pokemon. How does a Pokemon's appearance inspire these craftsmen to use their mastery to develop artwork that evokes both the spirit of the Pokemon and a demonstration of the mastery of their craft. This section featured artwork from Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> and Mitsuta Haruo <span class='ja'>満田晴穂</span> (both Metal Works), Fukuda Toru <span class='ja'>福田亭</span> (Wood Works), and Imai Sadamasa <span class='ja'>今井完眞</span> and Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span> (Ceramics).</p><p>My favorite pieces from this section was the Jolteon by Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> (pictured above), and the vase and bowl entitled "Vase with Pokemon of the Universe" <span class='ja'>森羅万像ポケモン壷</span> and "Beautiful Bowl with the Super-Ancient of Pokemon" <span class='ja'>超古代ポケモン玉盌</span>. Both were created by Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span>. (pictured below)</p><p>The Pokemon vase was interesting because you could stare at it for hours searching for various Pokemon and continue to find new ones you hadn't before. Also, I love how the Hoenn legendary pokemon are depicted in the Beautiful Bowl, clashing the power of fire, water, and wind.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>ものがたりー浸る</span>！ Stories - Jump in!</b></div><p>The second room features works inspired by the aspects of the Pokemon adventure, such as catching, battling, and evolving. While collecting Pokemon themselves is very much core to the series, the journey of the starting off at the beginning and slowly growing and strengthening your Pokemon and yourself as you become the strongest trainer in the land is equally inspiring. Works in this section were created by Tanaka Nobuyuki <span class='ja'>田中信行</span> and Ikeda Terumasa <span class='ja'>池田晃将</span> (Lacquerware), Niimi Hiroki <span class='ja'>新實広記</span>and Ikemoto Kazumi <span class='ja'>池本一三</span> (Glass Works), Hayashi Shigeki <span class='ja'>林茂樹</span> (Ceramics), Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span> (Metal Works), and Shiromi Eiichi <span class='ja'>城間栄市</span> and Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> (Textiles).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Hayashi Shigeki's Robot (Moonlight) greeted everyone when the reached the top of the stairs. All of the vases were really goofy, and the yukatas were pretty. The Yukatas, created by Shiromi Eiichi, were made using a Bingata pattern-style, traditional to Okinawa. These have repeated patterns of nature using primary colors of red, blue, yellow, green, and pink. The Alola starters, Pikachu, Raichu, and Oricorio fit both the pattern of colors, and island theme.</p><p>I think the biggest standouts to me were the transformable Rookidee figures which "evolve" into Corviknight, by Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span>. Obviously the size is off, but the proportions of both Pokemon are perfect, and coming up with a design to allow them to transform into each other is fascinating. The Pikachu forest, created by Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> was definitely the center piece of the room.

How can the flame of the Pokemon match the fires of the kiln when baking jars? How can the spirit and energy of Pokemon enlighten kimono and ornaments used in festivals? Craftsmen from this section include Katsura Morihito <span class='ja'>桂盛仁</span> (Metal Works), Taguchi Yoshiaki <span class='ja'>田口義明</span> (Lacquerware), Kuwata Takuro <span class='ja'>桑田卓郎</span>, Ueba Kasumi <span class='ja'>植葉香澄</span>, and Masumoto Keiko <span class='ja'>桝本佳子</span> (Ceramics), and Mizuhashi Saori <span class='ja'>水橋さおり</span> and Komiya Yasuyoshi <span class='ja'>小宮康義</span> (Textiles).</p><p>The most notable pieces in the room were the pottery created by Masumoto Keiko. The Charizard and Charmander pots made sense being fire Pokemon. The Ninetales pot was especially interesting as the inside of the pot was brown and burnt like the Kantonian form, but the outside was glazed white, like the Alolan form. I liked her Moltres piece the most. Moltres appears by breaking out of an egg with flames. I think the other standouts in the room where all of the figures created by Ueba Kasumi, especially the Shaymin figure. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Kogei Catalogue</b></div><p>The best thing about every museum and museum exhibit in Japan is that the gift shop sells a book detailing each piece on display.

| March 30, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Along the Shou river and within the various Gasshou-style villages in southern Toyama prefecture, there is a restaurant that stands alone on the side of the road with a bear of its sign. Underneath, there's another sign that says <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>, or <I>Kuma-don</I>, or a Bear Bowl, which would be a bowl of rice with bear meat. Nearly 6 years ago, I saw this sign as teachers and I were going exploring on our way to Kanazawa. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is <b>Takachiyo</b>, a restaurant that serves dishes made from the meat of local wildlife.</p><p>While the sign is very noticeable, its location is very out-of-the-way. It's about halfway between Takayama and Toyama along the highway, but it's about 10 minutes away from the highway exit. Most people from Takayama don't take the highway when going to Toyama because Route 41 has no tolls and takes the same amount of time. Route 41 goes a completely different direction through the mountains, so it never connects to the highway.</p><p>Here's the location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9" title="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9">https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9</a></p><p>Today, I went to Kanazawa, so on my return trip, I finally had the opportunity to visit the restaurant again.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides bear meat, the hunter that owns the restaurant, also traps deer and boar from the surrounding mountains. All of his dishes are prepared using local ingredients, including mountain vegetables, rice, and noodles. Soba noodles are hand-made from buckwheat grown by local people. </p><p>The menu mentions that killing animals for money is evil. However, we all live by consuming plants and animals. We must give thanks to them before each meal (and live together with them, in nature). This is the basic explanation of "Ittedakimasu," which is the 'grace' we all say before we eat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Five years ago, on my first visit to Takachiyo, I ordered their signature dish, the <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>. The bear meat was alright. It was tough and had a full taste, like beef. But, it also had a stringy-ness to it. Added with onions, eggs, and served on rice, it tasted delicious. </p><p>I went with some friends, and they ordered other dishes. One of my friends got some deer nabe. Nabe is a bit bowl of boiling broth with lots of vegetables and meat. It's similar to stew, but stew's main base is meat. Nabe's main base are the vegetables. Nabe is very weak in comparison. </p><p>The deer meat was alright. Japanese wild animals are much smaller compared with their American counterparts. They don't have gigantic bodies or gigantic muscles. As such, it didn't taste like venison I've had in the past. Again, more stringy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For my meal today, I ordered a Boar Bowl and Boar Udon. Boar was the one animal I hadn't tried last time, so I wanted to complete the triangle. The boar meat in both dishes was rough, like a flank steak. The meat itself had a dry texture, even though it was submerged in the Udon broth.</p><p>Overall, I would say that if you planned on going here to try exotic meats, you may leave disappointed. However, you would not be disappointed with the actual meals. While the meats themselves were just okay, the rice bowls and udon tasted excellent. Very good. Just good enough that I would recommend going out of the way to try and visit at least once.</p><p>There are plenty more things available on the menu than what I've ordered so far. He had English menus available to take, so I scanned it. Also, I still had a Japanese menu from the first time I visited.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Application for Permanent Residence" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/permanent-residence">Application for Permanent Residence</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 28, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 10 years ago, I moved to Japan. I didn’t necessarily intend to stay for more than a year or two, but I loved living here and loved teaching students. Teaching had become the most rewarding job I’ve done in my life, so I didn’t want to leave, and it never felt like my time in Japan was complete. Now, this is where I live. A town full of students or parents of students that I’ve helped teach for more than 10 years. And full of friends and connections that I’ve made over the years.</p><p>Now that 10 years has passed, I can apply for Permanent Residence in Japan. In simple terms, Permanent Residence means that I no longer have to renew a work VISA after 3 years and I can buy or build a house. But to me, it means that I’m further established as a part of Japan and don’t intend to leave. It’s the near-equivalent to a Green Card in the US.</p><p>Applying for Permanent Residence is not a simple process of filling out a couple of forms. There are many parts to prove your legal employment, payment of taxes, and contribution to Japan. I spent about a month working on the application back in October, only to have it rejected because I hadn’t lived here a complete 10 years yet. Now, 4 months later, my application is complete and it ended up being 47 pages long.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp"></a></p><p>It was so long that I wrote a Table of Contents describing everything that I included, and sectioned everything into different folders to make it as easy as possible for them to see what I’ve included.</p><p>Here are the table of contents.</p><p>0.      <b>Payment of Fee</b><br/>1.      <b>Application for Permanent Residence</b><br/>2.      <b>Photo</b><br/>3.      <b>Statement of Reason</b><br/>4.      <b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b><br/>5.      <b>Proof of Residence</b><br/>6.      <b>Proof of Employment</b><br/>7.      <b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b><br/>8.      <b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b><br/>9.      <b>Proof of Financial Assets</b><br/>10.    <b>Passport Photo</b><br/>11.    <b>Residence Card Photo</b><br/>12.    <b>Guarantor Information and References</b><br/>13.    <b>Proof of Contributions to Japan</b><br/>14.    <b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b><br/>15.    <b>Application Oath</b></p><p>The instructions for how to apply for permanent residence can be found on the government Immigration website. They are written in <a href="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">English</a> and in <a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">Japanese</a>. My table of contents follows the list of required materials from that page.</p><p>Even though, they have an English version that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to figure out what to do. These instructions are machine translated, and you still need to understand what they’re saying in Japanese because of the specific names for forms, and the specific departments and locations you need to visit. There’s a lot of running around involved getting all the correct documents, so I have detailed everything I did to build my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Payment of Fee</b></div><p>0.      <span class='ja'>手数料</span><br/>This is not required when you submit your application, but it will be required after your application is successful. You must fill out the Payment form and attach an 8000<span class='ja'>円</span> revenue stamp to it. Revenue stamps can be purchased from the post office. Obviously, if you’ve been in Japan long enough, you already know how to do this from renewing your VISA.</p><p>Here’s the payment form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf</a></p><div class='title'><b>Application for Permanent Residence & Photo</b></div><p>1.      <span class='ja'>永住許可申請書</span><br/>2.      <span class='ja'>写真</span><br/>The first document is the application itself. Again, from renewing a VISA, all the same information is here with the addition of a short version of why you want permanent residence, work history, and guarantor information. For my reason, I wrote "I wish to obtain permanent residence to continue teaching in Japan indefinitely and continue my study of kendo and Japanese culture to further enrich myself." It sounds like a lofty reason, but I have fully explained it in the next section.</p><p>Here’s the application form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf</a></p><p>Additionally, you’ll need a 40mm x 30mm photo attached to your application.</p><div class='title'><b>Statement of Reason</b></div><p>3.      <span class='ja'>理由書</span><br/>Perhaps the part of this application that will take the longest is writing about why you want permanent residence in Japan. My short version stated that I wish to teach in Japan indefinitely and continue to learn about Japan, but those ideas are weak unless there is proof. In total, I wrote 3 pages about my time over the last 10 years.</p><p>I started with detailing my current responsibilities and accomplishments working at my high school: supporting English teachers in class, leading English writing classes, being an assistant Homeroom teacher, leading classes to prepare students for studying abroad, training students for speech contests and winning them, and teaching foreign exchange students Japanese language and culture.</p><p>Next, I detailed my accomplishments and responsibilities working in public elementary and junior high schools as part of the JET Programme, such as supporting English classes and training students for speech contests, but also volunteering in town for English conversations classes supporting the hospital and library, developing summer English camp and other events for students, and developing a full English curriculum for elementary schools.</p><p>Also, I detailed my responsibilities as a Regional Prefectural Advisory supporting other ALTs in my region and the prefecture by developing our biannual skills conferences and leading lectures and discussions about lesson planning and ideas, as well as lead monthly meeting for the ALTs in my town.</p><p>Finally, I closed my statement of reason with my contributions to the kendo federation in my town. I wrote about how I joined students in their club activities and practiced kendo, what I learned from doing kendo both personally and professionally, and eventually reaching the rank of 3-dan.</p><p>3 pages might have been too much for a statement of reason, but I wanted to completely show everything noteworthy that I’ve done in Japan. It was very direct and unemotional, focusing on the facts. My approach to writing the statement was very similar to writing a resume for an application. Overall, I don’t think the statement has to be completely emotionless, but I don’t think it should be the main focus of the argument. Show, don’t tell, as I say to my students.</p><p>Even though I wrote all this information in English, I had to rewrite everything in Japanese, too. I had some help with that. I included both English and Japanese versions of my statement in my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b></div><p>4.      <span class='ja'>身分関係を証明する次のいずれかの資料（該当しません）</span><br/>I am not Japanese, so this was not required for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Residence</b></div><p>5.      <span class='ja'>住民票</span><br/>Whenever you move somewhere in Japan, you must register at the town hall so it has a complete and up-to-date record of all of its residents. The application for permanent residence requires a print of this record. It was easy to get from my town’s registrar by filling out a request document and paying 300<span class='ja'>円</span> for them to print the record.</p><p>It has information, such as when you moved to town, current address, previous addresses, nationality, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Employment</b></div><p>6.      <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span><br/>In addition to proving that you live somewhere, you also need to prove that you work somewhere. This was pretty easy for me to get since my school is private and not that big. For a larger organization or a government organization, it might take some time for your request to go open the chain and for the document to come back down.</p><p>I just went to the office and they created a document that proved my employment. Depending on whichever company you work for, it may be an official document or it may not. I think it just needs to include a statement saying you work there as well as information that can be contacted later. My school/company just made up an official looking document with all the correct information on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b></div><p>7.      <span class='ja'>直近（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）の申請人及び申請人を扶養する方の所得及び納税状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Things start to get more complicated, as a single piece of paper proving your employment isn’t enough. Of course, you need to show that you’ve been paying taxes on the income that you’ve earned. And also show that you’ve been doing it for at least five years.</p><p>These documents include the <I>Kazei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>課税証明書</span> and the <I>Nozei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span>. Both documents translate as either Tax Certificate or Taxation Certificate, so looking at the English information about this section may not be helpful. Overall, the <I>Kazei</I> Tax Certificate details how much taxes you had to pay and what taxes you had to pay on your income within a given year. The <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate details the amount of taxes you still owe for a given year. Essentially, <I>Kazei</I> is like an itemized bill, and <I>Zozei</I> is the receipt.</p><p>Each document you’ll need for 5 years. For my town, I had a single <I>Kazei</I> Certificate for each year. For the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate, each year could be written on the same document. For each document, for each year, it cost 300<span class='ja'>円</span>. So for all the documents, my bill would’ve been 3000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>However, <I>update</I>, when I initially turned in my application, I forgot to get 5 years for the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate. I was able to turn in my application, but I needed to mail in the correct form within two weeks. They gave me an envelope and a sheet that described the document I was missing. Another problem, though: my town only keeps the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate up to 4 years, instead of the 5 years they wanted. I called them, and they said 4 years was fine. So, my bill was actually 2700<span class='ja'>円</span> for these documents.</p><p>Additionally! There’s another version of the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate that is required. Besides the Tax Record office in city hall, I went to my town’s official Tax Office. Requesting the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate from them shows them I’ve paid all debts and taxes across all government departments and agencies, as well as never missed any payment for any bills or loan. This document cost 500<span class='ja'>円</span> to print.</p><p>In addition, to these tax documents, I had to include a photo of my bank book that proved I was getting paid the correct income.</p><p>So, for this section, I included the following documents:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>課税証明書（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）</span>- Kazei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - Nozei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書（未払いの税金がないことを証明するためのパート</span>3<span class='ja'>）</span>- Nozei Cert proving no upaid taxes<br/>·        <span class='ja'>預貯金通帳（写し）</span>- Photo proving income.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b></div><p>8.      <span class='ja'>申請人の公的年金及び公的医療保険の保険料の納付状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Now that I had shown that I am legally employed, getting legally paid, and responsibly paying taxes on my legal income, I need to show that I’m paying into either my company’s pension or the government’s pension for at least two years. Also that I have health insurance.</p><p>This section was somewhat difficult to follow. Initially, I just took a photo copy of my annual pension report that I had gotten in mail, but (<I>update!</I>) apparently that wasn’t enough. A few days after I turned in my application, I got a letter in the mail requesting another form. The form they wanted detailed all of my pension payments, and each pension that I’ve contributed to. It was called the <I>Hihokenja Chousho Shoukai Kaitou-hyou</I> <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span> or the “Insurance Record Inquiry Report,” I think? I’m not sure why it says insurance when its about pensions.</p><p>To get this form, I had to go to my town’s Pension office and request these forms. Prior to going to the office, I had some co-workers give them a call to make sure I was getting the right forms, and they were able to prepare everything for me before I arrived. It turned a possible 40-minute wait into 5 minutes. This document was also 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Looking at this document, I’ve contributed into a government pension when I worked for the city as a teacher, and I’ve contributed to a private pension I have with my current job. </p><p>The letter wanted me to include receipts from any contributions to the government’s individual pension service, but I never did that, so I didn’t have any.</p><p>For the health insurance card, I just took a photo of it and blacked out the account number.</p><p>So, this is what I included from this section:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>ねんきん定期便（写し）</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>健康保険被保険者証（写し）</span></p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Financial Assets</b></div><p>9.      <span class='ja'>申請人又は申請人を扶養する方の資産を証明する次のいずれかの資料</span><br/>For the next part, I had to show all of Japanese financial assets. At minimum, I had to take photo copies of my bank statements to show how much money I have in Japan. I don’t have a house, so I didn’t have anything to show there. I do have a car, but I didn’t include any proof of that. Maybe I should have?</p><div class='title'><b>Passport Photo and Residence Card Photo</b></div><p>10.      <span class='ja'>申請人のパスポート（写し）</span><br/>11.      <span class='ja'>申請人の在留カード（写し）</span><br/>I included photo copies of my passport and residence card with my application, but this is not really necessary. When you turn in your application, you’ll need to also show them both of these, and they can take a photo copy themselves, at this time. I included these to save time.</p><div class='title'><b>Guarantor Information and References</b></div><p>12.      <span class='ja'>身元保証に関する資料</span><br/>A current Japanese citizen needs to vouch for who I am, what I stand for, and state that I would make a contribution to Japan by becoming a Japanese permanent resident. This person should be someone you know pretty well, and have a good relationship with. My principal at school has always sponsored my VISA, as well as other documents that required official clearance, so he was an easy choice as a guarantor.</p><p>They need to fill in the guarantor form and prove who they are. For my guarantor, we included the following:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>身元保証書</span> - the guarantor application<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証</span> - a photo copy of their ID (driver’s license, in this case)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span> - proof of employment, wherever they work.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - proof of tax payments. (<I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>住民票</span> - proof of residence.</p><p>Here’s the guarantor form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf</a> (Japanese)<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf</a> (English)</p><div class='title'><b>Contributions to Japan</b></div><p>13.      <span class='ja'>我が国への貢献に係る資料（</span>※<span class='ja'>ある場合のみで結構です。）</span><br/>This is the last meaty section of the application. For this section, I included my letters of recommendation and other certificates and awards of accomplishments. </p><p>In the end, I had 3 recommendation letters: one letter from the principal, one letter from the head of our English department, and one letter from head of the Kendo federation in my town. Each letter of recommendation talked about the contributions that I made to my school and kendo in town, and talked about why they think I should be awarded permanent residence.</p><p>Additional documents that I included were proof of things mentioned in either my Statement of Reason or their Letters of Recommendation. I included a photo of my kendo license showing participation for 10 years, my 3-dan diploma, and certificates of participation for 3 years in the international budo conference. I also included a photo of my driver’s license to show that not only do I have a license, but maintaining a perfect and safe driving record to be awarded a 5-year gold license.</p><p>All in all, here were my documents for this section.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from principal)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from head of English)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from Kendo Federation)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>剣道免許（写し）</span>- Kendo License Photo<br/>·        <span class='ja'>剣道</span>３<span class='ja'>段免許（写し）</span>- Kendo 3-dan Diploma<br/>·        <span class='ja'>国際武道文化セミナー</span> <span class='ja'>修了証</span> <span class='ja'>（</span>３<span class='ja'>年分）</span> - International Budo Conference particpation<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証（写し）</span>- Photo of Gold Driver’s License</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b></div><p>14.      <span class='ja'>身分を証する文書等（該当しません）</span><br/>I’m not Japanese, so I did not need to do this. </p><p>I’m not sure if this one is proof of ancestry or identity, or what the difference is between part 4 above. For one of these, there is some kind of official family document Japanese people have that shows all of their registered family members, and you need to include a photo copy of it.</p><div class='title'><b>Application Oath</b></div><p>15.      <span class='ja'>了解書　</span>１<span class='ja'>通</span><br/>The final document required is signing the application oath form. By signing this, you agree that if anything information within the application changes over the next 4 to 6 months, you must notify immigration about these changes and update your application.</p><p><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001356126.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001356126.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/001356126.pdf</a> (English)</p><div class='title'><b>Complete!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0503_t.webp"></a></p><p>That’s everything. It doesn’t really seem like all that much once I finished making everything and putting it together. However, a lot of the time spent on the application is figuring out exactly what is required and where to go. The tax and pensions details are pretty tricky. I think my situation is pretty easy because I’ve only had the one job in the last 5 years, and the job is run by a professional organization. I also don’t have a house. Although, getting those documents probably aren’t too tough.</p><p>On February 13th, I drove up north to Toyama and turned in my application at Toyama Branch Office of the Nagoya Regional Immigration Bureau. A long time ago, I figured out that very few people actually go to this branch office, so the wait time is never more than 5 minutes. In Gifu, wait times can be as long as 45 minutes. And in Nagoya, a friend of mine waited for an hour and a half once.</p><p>Again, the clerk instantly noticed one probably with my application (the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate not being 5 years), so I had to submit that afterward. I also got a letter in the mail on February 17th about the pension document. But, they accepted my application, and I’ve mailed those requested document as soon as I could. All documents were submitted as of February 21st, and I have not received any more letters about any more problems.  I think it’s all good!</p><p>Typically these application can take up to six months to be completely reviewed and responded to, but the clerk mentioned that it may only take three months to be complete. Over the last three years, thanks to Covid, the number of people moving to Japan has significantly decreased because the government shut down travel.  Previously, my VISA application would take 4 weeks to get approved, but it only took a week last year.</p><p>Hopefully, by May, I’ll get the postcard in the mail to come back down and get my card. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Overview of the Japanese Language" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/overview-of-the-japanese-language">Overview of the Japanese Language</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 20, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Coming from English, Japanese is one of the most difficult languages on learn. It's so difficult to learn because nearly every aspect of the language is different. The words, the grammar, the ideas, the culture, and the way Japanese is used all differ from English. </p><p>In fact, the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" title="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/">Foreign Service Institute</a> classifies Japanese as a Category IV language, which requires a minimum of 2200 hours of class time (88 weeks of 5-hour daily training) to achieve a General Professional Proficiency level. It is the Institute's high ranking, shared only by Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.</p><p>The best way to learn Japanese, and any language, is to be immersed in the language. Have daily contact with the language, and try to find a balance of using all four or five methods of communicating with a language. These four methods are: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Sometimes, people break speaking into two methods: speaking written or prepared words and speaking your own improvised thoughts. Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing is also the order of difficulty of performing them.</p><div class='title'><b>Listening</b></div><p>By being in Japan, listening becomes a daily routine. However, it can be easy to shut everything out and ignore what it said around you. In your native country listening to your native language, you can hear and understand everything around you. You are part of the public consciousness. In a foreign country with a foreign language, you're no longer able to naturally understand everything. You have to work at it. And work is often exhausting, which makes it easy to tune out others.</p><p>There's a lot to understand, and it's possible that there's some things that you'll never understand. But, as time goes on, you will have the ability to understand some things, and be able to connect dots to understand things. If you get in the habit of tuning out others, you rob yourself of the ability to naturally understand your surroundings. So, don't tune out too much. Make attempts at understanding.</p><p>When you hear common phrases, or sometimes when people talk with you. Try repeating what they say. This may seem stupid, but this is how babies naturally begin to learn languages. Which, also may seem stupid for you. Of course, as adults, we can also learn the rules of the languages and compare them with our own language. The combination of these two things will allow use to learn the language.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>Listening becomes the easiest method of communication in Japan because you have so many passive opportunities to practice. Writing is the most difficult because you are not only outputting what you know of the language, but you have to activity do it to get better at it. It takes the most work and time out of the others.</p><p>Unlike English with its 26 letters (or 52, including both upper and lowercase alphabets), Japanese uses three sets of alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana have 46 characters each. Kanji, on the other hand, has over 10,000. Although, there are hundreds or thousands of kanji that are outdated. High School graduates are expected to know the most common 2,000. The Genki books only go through about 320.</p><p>All three of these alphabets are used together. Take a look at this sentence:</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span></p></p><p>The first two characters are <span class='ja'>ジム</span>, katakana. Katakana is almost exclusively used for foreign words in the Japanese language. Both Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic alphabets, so each of the characters have specific sounds that are said the exact same way wherever they are in the sentence, with a few exceptions. <span class='ja'>ジム</span> is my name, Jim, which is phonetically spelled.</p><p>The next two characters are <span class='ja'>先生</span>, kanji. In sentences, kanji are used for solid words, such as Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives. In this sentence, we have 3 words using kanji: <span class='ja'>先生</span>, <span class='ja'>店</span>, and <span class='ja'>行く</span>. <span class='ja'>先生</span> is <i>sensei</i>, or teacher. Combined with my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生</span>, it's used as a suffix to denote that I'm a teacher. Generally, non-casually, when referring to other people, you use a suffix with their name. <span class='ja'>店</span> is <i>mise</i>, or store. And, <span class='ja'>行く</span> is <i>iku</i>, or the verb, to go.</p><p>The other characters in the sentence (<span class='ja'>は</span>, <span class='ja'>に</span>, <span class='ja'>きます</span>) are hiragana. This is getting ahead of ourselves, but they are used in the sentence as particles and a conjugation. Using <span class='ja'>は</span>(wa) after my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生は</span> denotes that I'm the subject of the sentence. Using <span class='ja'>に</span>(ni) with shop <span class='ja'>店に</span> denotes the direction of the action. And, <span class='ja'>行きます</span>(ikimasu) is the present positive conjugation of the verb <span class='ja'>行く</span>, meaning to go.</p><p>Putting the meaning together: Jim goes to the store. (or Mr. Jim goes to the store.)</p><div class='title'><b>Hiragana and Pronunciation</b></div><p>Even though there are three writing systems, both katakana and kanji can be written in hiragana, which is the first alphabet we'll learn. Additionally, every hiragana character can be written in Alphabetic characters, which is where we'll start when learning words.

The vowel sounds do not change when paired with other characters.</p><p>Also, you may have noticed that ji, from my name <span class='ja'>じむ</span>, is not listed in the alphabet. There are certain characters that can take a <i>ten-ten</i> mark or a <i>maru</i> mark to slightly expand the alphabet. <span class='ja'>し</span>(shi) becomes <span class='ja'>じ</span>(ji).</p><div class='title'><b>Kanji and Readability</b></div><p>Note: Often students wonder, if you can write a sentence using only hiragana, a much less complex writing system, why ever use the other two?

In fact, I added spaces in the hiragana sentence to improve its readability, but you still have to read each character to understand the words. The kanji sentence doesn't even need it.</p><p>While we don't use Kanji in English, the idea of using symbols to form a familiar shape representing a word is not so foreign. We've been reading and writing English since we were children, and one of the natural passive techniques we've developed is recognizing a word purely based on its shape. As long as the shape of the word fits the pattern we're used to, we can read and understand the word immediately without looking at each of the letters.</p><p>Kanji works the same way. Once you know the meaning of the kanji, you don't even have to read the whole sentence. Because there are so many kanji, much of a sentence's ambiguity is also removed. When I say, "light" without any context, do I mean something that shines on to a surface or something that's not heavy? Much like English, Japan has words written in Hiragana the same way with different meanings. But when using Kanji, the meaning is clear.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Again, learning Japanese is not a simple process. Just takes things step-by-step. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. And, always try.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Culture Shock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/culture-shock">Culture Shock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 19, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Culture shock is the overall swing of excitement and depression that comes with being in a foreign country for an extended period of time. Almost everyone has some form of culture shock, but it is different for each person and each person deals with it in different ways.</p><p>It can sometimes happen abruptly from a situation or incident, or slowly build from small problems over time. Sometimes, incidents of culture shock can happen immediately upon arrival. Other times, it might be months until feeling some kind of culture shock. For me, there have been two periods where I've lived in Japan, now and study abroad in college. Both circumstances for living in Japan were entirely different, so the conditions of experiencing culture shock were entirely different, too.</p><p>Either way, when living in a foreign country, culture shock follows 4 (or 5) overall stages and the overall graph of your steady mood usually looks like this.</p><p><canvas id="fullChart" /></p><p>Going up, then down, back up and eventually returning to equilibrium. The four main stages are <span class="rainbow_mag"><b>The Honeymoon Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_voi"><b>The Frustration Phase</b></span>, <span class="rainbow_blu"><b>The Adjustment Phase</b></span>, and <span class="rainbow_gre"><b>The Adaption Phase</b></span>. The fifth extra phase is <b>The Reintegration Phase</b>, when returning to your own country.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Honeymoon Phase -</b></div><p>When people think of culture shock, they often think of it as something negative. But, the overall feeling of experiencing life in a new country is often met with excitement. There are so many new things to experience differently from your own country. New food, new buildings, new money, new people, new stores. If you're a fan of your new country, touching things that you've dreamed of for the first time is an amazing experience you'll probably never forget.</p><p>All of these new experiences raise your overall mood level, and we move up the curve.</p><p>If you're only in a foreign country for a short amount of time, especially on vacation or a very short study abroad, this is probably the only part of the curve that you'll experience. This was the case when I studied abroad. Every day felt like a vacation. Exploring Nagasaki and writing blog posts about it was an amazing adventure that had something new and interesting each day. I never experienced any cultural problems large enough to pull me down.</p><p>So, in short, the honeymoon phase is meeting differences in culture with joy and excitement.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Frustration Phase -</b></div><p>The shock phase is the opposite. This is what happens when meeting differences between your countries and cultures has problems. This is also what people think of when they hear, Culture Shock.</p><p>Again, this can happen gradually over the course of several incidents or perhaps even one big incident. Problems are caused by not really understanding what people are saying. Or by people not really understanding you. Problems are caused by something someone said or did that was different than what you expected. Problems are caused by someone putting you into a situation where you felt uncomfortable and you felt trapped. And problems are also caused by small differences in culture that annoy and bother you that built over time.</p><p>It's easy to feel alone when you're in a foreign country. People often describe this feeling as being put into a box. In a foreign country, you don't have the same comforts as your normal routine. If you have a problem, you may not have a way to comfort yourself. And often when seeking those comforts, you can't find an equivalent and often don't know how to ask for it. So, for any problems, you hide in your box and you wait for this feeling to pass. Or, you wait until you're back home.</p><p>Often as you recluse, anything foreign or anything outside of your normal will reinforce these feelings and put you further into a spiral you cannot break from.</p><div class='title'><b>Experience</b></div><p>Often when you're in a foreign country for a short amount of time, you probably won't have enough time for these problems to really build and hit you. And if you do have problems, you only have to wait until the end of trip. There's a fast-approaching light at the end of the tunnel. </p><p>That doesn't mean it won't happen for short trips, but be prepared that it might. It really comes down to expectations. Making too many assumptions without verification often leads to problems.</p><p>Frustration and Shock is much more common to occur after several months of living in the country. After meeting with people and working with people, making friends, and hanging out, you begin to feel like you're accepted, and like you've become part of the society.</p><p>But, you are pushed away. Your friends or co-workers do something that clearly shows they do not truly accept you as part of their society. You're just the foreigner, and you'll always be the foreigner. Once again, you made an assumption that you thought was fact.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adjustment Phase -</b></div><p>The overall strategy of Culture Shock is not to avoid it, but learning how to deal with it. This is the adjustment phase. Much like frustration, the ways that people naturally adjust are different for each person, but there's always room to learn and try new ways of returning back to natural mood level.</p><p>Skipping to the punchline, the overall best way of adjusting and understanding the situation better is to talk about it. Talk with your co-workers and friends about why you felt uncomfortable. Talk to other foreigners about similar situations, how they felt and how they overcame it. By talking about it, I mean opening a dialogue and expressing ideas. By talking about it, I <b>do not</b> mean to confront them about what they said and try to teach them why it's bad. </p><p>On one hand, they could absolutely be out of line and did something worthy of being called on. But, on the other hand, within their culture, it could be a socially-accepted action. If you call them on it, you're only reinforcing your foreign divide between them, and possibly reinforcing their behavior. Often in these scenarios, it's up to you to change. It's up to you to ask others and inform yourself about why any misunderstandings may have happened.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Tricks</b></div><p>Above is the overall best way to adjust, but there are several tricks to help elevate your mood.</p><p>If you're being overwhelmed by too many things outside of your comfort zone, try to reconnect with things from your home country. It's a good way to feel like you're normal. Buy some foreign food from your country. Or watch a movie. Or visit somewhere that reminds you of home. Call your parents or call your friends back home. If you feel like an outsider, take a vacation and be an outsider, if only for a few hours or a day.</p><p>It's also pretty simple, but exercise. Exercise is a great way to mentally relax. Often as you blow off all of your physical strength through exercise, your mental strength will get exhausted, too. Then, you're able to move through your emotions and process them. Maybe meditation is your thing instead of exercise? Singing is fun, too.</p><p>Whether its food or exercise or singing, finding some way of centering yourself can slow or stop your downward fall, so you can begin the climb back up.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Adaption Phase -</b></div><p>The Adjustment Phase course corrects your mood and brings your back up to normal, through the Adaptation phase.</p><p>The more you understand about your foreign country, the more you can understand about how you fit into it. When you can successfully apply that knowledge to your life, you feel like you've had a win. You feel like you've overcome a barrier and become closer to your new home. <b>This is your overall goal</b>. Overall understanding and adaptation isn't something that happens over night. It takes time, patience, and communication. And often new problems occur. </p><div class='title'><b>Reoccurrence</b></div><p>Culture Shock and frustration isn't a single event. It's often multiple events throughout your life in a foreign country that make you feel like a foreigner and not accepted. Once you feel you've adapted, it's not uncommon for something new and unknown to happen and bring you back down.</p><p>Also, it's not uncommon for people to cling to quick fixes or escape rather than truly reach out, communicate and understand the problem. If you hold on to grudges and problems, you will never fit in and you'll always be an outsider. </p><p>Ultimately, your goal is to fit in society as best as you can. You must adapt in some ways in order to do this. This doesn't mean losing part of yourself. It means gaining a new part of yourself. Gaining the ability to fit into both societies.</p><div class='title'><b>- The Reintegration Phase -</b></div><p>If you're in a foreign country to live forever, then adaptation is the goal. But most foreigners will eventually go back to their country, either for a trip or for good. Then, the whole cycle begins again, but often it can be more severe. This is The Reintegration Phase, also sometimes known as Reverse Culture Shock.</p><p>If you've adapted and integrated in your foreign country, now YOU are the foreigner when you return home. You are expected to pick up life exactly as you left it, but you are different. You've changed. You do things differently than before. You talk different than before. Your personality may have changed, too. Depending on the length of time you've been away, your country has changed, too.</p><p>If you've been integrated in your foreign country for a while, you can often forget what it's like to no longer have a foreign bubble around you. You suddenly instantly passively understand everyone and everything around you, whereas in your new country, you become comfortable in certain levels of understanding. </p><p>People make a lot of assumptions about you, too, because they don't see you as anything different than themselves. Adjusting is often a harsh reality of what you've left behind.</p><p>This is normal. But, you've been here before. Honeymoon phase, Frustration phase, Adjustment phase, and Adaptation phase. Do your best, and don't give up. Communicate, Exercise, and Adapt.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Capsule Machine Capsule" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/capsule-machine-capsule">Capsule Machine Capsule</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A miniature capsule machine for my shelf.</p><p>Now that I had one, I needed to have them all! I searched for the set on the Internet and learned what I could. This particular set was called <span class='ja'>ガチャガチャマシーン</span>３ (or Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3), and it was released in December 2021. So, it was already out in the wild for 3 months. I learned that you can buy full distributions of some capsule times on Amazon.  For Gatcha Gatcha Machine 3 that consisted of 24 capsules, which was 3 complete sets of 8 items: 3 red machines, 3 white machines, 1 pack of capsules, and 1 set of metal shelves.  So, the Capsules I had gotten were a 1/8 rare pull. The red machine was a typical 3/8 pull.</p><p>I continued searching on Yahoo Auctions to find someone selling the missing items in my set, but most people were selling a full set of 8 or selling the rare pulls for a lot of money. Eh. I gave up. One capsule machine is good enough. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Update - March 2023</b></div><p>This has continued to nag at me over the last year. The other day, I was back on Yahoo Auctions looking around and I saw an auction for the two unique pieces of the set I was missing: the white capsule machine and a set of the shelving. It was only $10, so why not?</p><p>Not long after they arrived in the mail. The White capsule machine was in perfect condition, looking amazing and working well. The shelving was not.

I had already streamed some Playstation games using the native share method, but I wanted to stream Switch games, too.</p><p>I bought an AverMedia Ultra Gamer external capture card (after the Elgato one didn't work) and it worked pretty proficiently. OBS uses a lot of power when running, so I have to limit my streams to 720p or else the battery can't charge itself fast enough from all the power usage.</p><p>I streamed Let's Go Eevee almost daily for multiple hours. Unfortunately, Nintendo did not release end of the year stats as they did for previous years. :(</p><p>In July, I was finally able to order a Playstation 5. I had tried getting one in Japan, but there were so few shipments and retailers had many weird hoops to go through to get one. I got mine directly through Sony online in America, so I had my mom ship it to me, which was a little expensive. :( </p><div class='title'><b>Playstation</b></div><p>With a Playstation 5, I started playing some more games on stream rather than just Pokemon. Although, every game I played was an enhanced version of a Playstation 4 game (or simply a Playstation 4 game). <b>Final Fantasy VII Remake</b> got a PS5 version. <b>Death Stranding</b> got a PS5 version.</p><p>The first game I played through on stream was <b>Control</b>, a some cerebral action-adventure set in a retro corporate setting. You play as Jesse, who is appointed as the new director of the FBC, and you tear through the depths of the vast headquarters looking for your brother and the secrets of the organization. It was neat, and free with PSN from a few months prior.</p><p>My absolute favorite game of the year was <b>Outer Wilds</b>. It's a very simple game where you play as an alien species on a small world. The sun will go super nova at the end of the day, and you explore all the planets and other locations of your solar system to discover the ancient history of your species, as well as find a way for life to survive the super nova. It's an incredible experience where you are given the tiniest spec of a hint at the beginning of what to do, and from there, everything is found through your own exploration and experimentation.</p><p>Anyways, here are my stats:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-games.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-hours.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2021/ps-trophies.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Even though Nintendo did not release play stats for the Switch, with the termination of the Wii U and 3DS online services, Nintendo did make a webpage where you could see your lifetime stats from both platforms.</p><p>Compared to the 900 hours I played on my Nintendo Switch last year, 1102 lifetime hours on the 3DS seems a bit low.

| March 12, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I attended the 30th Annual International Seminar of Budo Culture, which coincided with the 150th anniversary of the start of the Meiji era in Japan.  This year’s main lecture was <b>The Features and Potential of Japanese Budo Culture</b> given by Seiichi Takeuchi <span class='ja'>竹内</span> <span class='ja'>整一</span>.  He is currently a professor at Kamakura Women’s University, and former professor of the University of Tokyo.  His field is the study of ethics and Japanese thought.</p><p>The lecture was given in Japanese and translated into English by Alex Bennett, who is currently a professor at Kansai University and has written and translated many books on the Japanese Budo arts.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5456_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was my 3rd time attending the seminar.  Every year I’m able to get amazing insights into budo martial arts and learn about their connection to Japanese psychology and culture.  I previously wrote about the main lecture from the first seminar I attended two years ago: <a href="/old/v7/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan" title="/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">March 4th, 2016</a>.</p><p>Overall, I felt the contents of the lecture did not match the title, but the main idea expressed in the lecture was another fascinating look at an explanation for Japanese culture.  The theme carried through the explanations and examples was that of <i>onozukara</i> and <i>mizukara</i></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」</span></b></div><p>Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> explained the cooperative duality of these two forces behind the decisions and actions of people in Japanese culture and society.</p><p><i>Onozukara</i> <span class='ja'>おのずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自然の働く</span><br/><i>Mizukara</i> <span class='ja'>みずから</span> - <span class='ja'>自分の能力</span></p><p>Let’s do <i>mizukara</i>, first.  <i>Mizukara</i> is the effect from oneself.  It’s the idea that an action or decision you made came as a result of your own willpower.  <i>Onozukara</i> is the workings of nature, the idea that there is an overwhelming force behind a decision or action that made or allowed it happen.</p><p><i>Mizukara</i> is pretty easy to understand, but <i>Onozukara</i> is much more ambiguous.  In western countries, <i>onozukara</i> could be similar to the will of god.  God is an outside influence, and people often thank God for giving them fortunes, or blame God for misfortunes.  This was brought up in a question after the lecture had finished.</p><p>But for Japanese people, the idea of God is not a singular entity.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned if you asked a Japanese person who they pray to when they pray, they would not have an answer.  They wouldn’t know.  The will of nature is a result of many different factors and moving parts within the world and society.</p><p>As another example, another question was asked, "Did you decide to do this lecture? Or was it the will of nature?"  He replied that he did want to do lecture, but he was also asked by many people to do it.  The people he knew and the connections he’s made throughout his life knew his expertise that made him qualified to give a lecture on this subject.  In that way, there was a force that created the opportunity for him to accept.  So, this lecture was a result of the actions of both nature and self.</p><p>So, the idea of <i>onozukara</i> is the force of everything around us.  It’s the connections we’ve made with people in our lives, the opportunities society gives us, and nature itself.  It is not, directly, "the will of God."</p><div class='title'><b>Example within Japanese Language</b></div><p>These two concepts aren’t something that is thought of on the surface level.  People aren’t consciously thinking about the will of themselves or nature when making decisions.  But there are examples within the Japanese language that build on this idea.</p><p>The main example given was <b>I am to be married</b> <span class='ja'>結婚することになった</span>.  When people get married in Japan and they announce it to their family and friends, they use this phrase.  It’s very passive and reflects the idea of <i>onozukara</i>.  Getting married is simply a matter of course.  It’s natural.  Additionally, the effect of getting married wasn’t just decided or caused between the two involved.  It was the culmination of the people around them and their families’ blessings and good intentions.</p><p>He did mention later in the lecture that a lot of young people these days use a more affirmative phrase when speaking informally about marriage, <span class='ja'>結婚することにした</span>, <b>we’ve decided to get married</b>.  The two getting married take responsibility for their marriage as opposed to passively excepting it as a matter of nature.</p><p>There could be any number of reasons for why this is becoming more popular.  Perhaps young people aren’t being taught more tradition methods of speaking than they were before.  Maybe people aren’t getting married as often as before, so they don’t hear the phrase enough.  Or perhaps, as English and the western world becomes more prevalent in Japan, people are becoming more direct and affirmative when expressing themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Connections to Budo</b></div><p>As a practitioner of a budo martial arts, we also seek for our movements to become natural.  In the beginning, we chose to study a martial art of our own free will (<i>mizukara</i>).  We all have our reasons for wanting to do it, whether it be for health, for friends, for fun, or because it looks cool.  We start from ourselves.</p><p>There Japanese word <span class='ja'>習う</span> <i>narau</i> means "to learn", but literally, it means "to continually repeat things" and becoming accustomed to it.  As a result, over time, these actions become natural.  You no longer need to think to do them.</p><p>In Budo, we strive for this level of movement where the thought process is no longer a factor, and to become part of nature, the natural flow of life (<i>onozukara</i>).  When movements and actions are not performed naturally, they are not seen as being complete.</p><p>In Kyudo (archery), for example, when one reaches the level of complete mastery, the practitioner feels that the bow no longer exists.</p><div class='title'><b>The 3 points of Japanese Thought</b></div><p>Within the balance of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> is the concept of Japanese thought and 3 points that define it.</p><p><span class='ja'>自然</span> <i>shizen</i> - nature<br/><span class='ja'>意気</span> <i>iki</i> - will power<br/><span class='ja'>諦念</span> <i>teinen</i> - resignation</p><p>The idea of <b>nature</b> leads to accidental fury that was must put up with.  It’s something that we must endure and grow from.  <b>Will power</b> is the willingness to put your body on line for what may happen.  And if something goes wrong, it’s your responsibility to <b>resign</b> yourself to the outcome, and not make excuses for the result.</p><p>Though, resignation does not mean to simply give up.  It’s about reconciling the efforts of one’s will with the movement of nature, and to be able to see something clearly for what it is.  And in some cases, recognize your powerlessness to deal with whatever comes.  We take for granted our power over nature and often think that we can overcome it, but in reality we cannot.  Nature is a much greater force.</p><p><span class='ja'>申し訳ない</span> <i>moushi wakenai</i><br/>This phrase literally translates to "there were no reasons behind my actions" or "there is no verbal excuse for what I have done."  This is used as a strong apology in Japanese, but an actual apology means to explain your actions and why you were wrong.  This goes one step further by saying there can be no excuse for the action I’ve done.  In this way, you’ve accepted the outcome (resigned) and take full responsibility (will power).</p><p>On the other hand…</p><p><span class='ja'>すみません</span> <i>sumimasen</i><br/>This is used as a light apology and basically means <b>excuse me</b> or <b>sorry</b>, but the direct and complete translation is something closer to "my actions were not clear or clean or complete," or "I wasn’t able to completely do this action myself."</p><div class='title'><b>Other Japanese Words</b></div><p>Much like the lecture on the cardinal virtues of Japan, speaker Seiichi Takeuchi wrote several books on the subject of <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.  He wrote 4 books, actually.  3 of which are out-of-print and expensive!  On Amazon, they are being sold for nearly 7000<span class='ja'>円</span>.  But, there was one book I could buy for only 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5463_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b><span class='ja'>「おのずから」と「みずから」のあわいで</span> <span class='ja'>やまと言葉で</span> <span class='ja'>哲学する</span>.</b> or <i>onozukara to mizukara no awai de yamato-kotoba de tetsugaku-suru</i>.  <i>Awai</i> isn’t so easy to translate, but I was told, in this context, that it basically means between.  Takeuchi<span class='ja'>先生</span> talked about this balance between both <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i> in his lecture, so I think it makes sense.  <i>Yamato-kotoba</i> basically means words (<i>kotoba</i>) that encompass the spirit of Japan (<i>yamato</i>).  And lastly, <i>tetsugaku</i> is philosophy.  So, the title is basically <b>The Philosophy of Japanese Words and Their Existence Between the Balance of <i>Onozukara</i> and <i>Mizukara</i></b>.</p><p>The book starts off with a quick summary and definition for <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>, and then has chapter on specific Japanese words, phrases, or expressions, their history, and their connection to <i>mizukara</i> and <i>onozukara</i>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For example, <span class='ja'>ありがたい</span> (thanks), <span class='ja'>めでたい</span> (congratulations), <span class='ja'>あう</span> (when meeting someone), <span class='ja'>あいする</span> (loving someone), and so forth.  Maybe in the future, I’ll try and go through some of these chapters and write something about them.  For many people, though, Japanese philosophy is an incredibly dense topic.</p><div class='title'><b>Relation to Myself</b></div><p>Anyways, </p><p class='img'><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180309_budo/IMG_5446_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Lecture Abstract</b></div><p>Japanese will often say things like <i>kekkon suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to be married) or <i>shuushoku suru koto ni natta</i> (I am to start work).  It should be expressed as "I decided to …"  Even if something is decided by the will of the individual (<i>mizukara</i>), it is expressed as something that has been predetermined for him or her as a matter of course (<i>onozukara</i>).  This in turn indicates a tendency to accept things in one’s life and the world as being naturally preordained and to be accepted passively.  The Japanese philosophers Kuki Shuuzou identified three elements in the features of Japanese thought: "nature" (<i>shizen</i>), "chic" (<i>iki</i>), and "resignation" (<i>teinen</i>).  This means that based on "natural" (<i>onozukara</i>) conduct, when something occurs the individual decides from one’s self (<i>mizukara</i>) to confront the situation putting their own body on the line (for example, seppuku) in the spirit of "chicness" (<i>iki</i>), while also resigning (<i>teinen</i>) the self to go with the natural flow (<i>onozukara</i>).  The culture of Japanese thought is considered within the encounter between the movement of nature (<i>onozukara</i>) and exertion of the self (<i>mizukara</i>).</p><p>Japanese budo culture is the same.  According to Kuki, "The ideas of Japanese morality maintain a significant meaning in universal nature (of <i>onozukara</i>)…  Morality which must reach the stage of becoming 'natural' cannot be seen as complete."  The term "morality" (<i>doutoku</i>) can be replaced by the word "budo" here.  In bud, first engaging in rigorous training or study from your own volition (<i>mizukara</i>), if it does not ultimately become an inevitably natural (<i>onozukara</i>) activity then it "cannot be seen as complete."  To "<i>narau</i>" (learn) means "to continually repeat things" thereby gradually becoming accustomed (<i>nare</i>) to it, and "reaching the stage where it is natural."  In the culture of Japanese bud, there are correlations with moral, religious, and artistic thought in that one’s own efforts (<i>mizukara</i>) will finally proliferate into and connect with natural expansiveness and depth (<i>onozukara</i>).  Seen in this way, the features and potential become apparent.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/5">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/japan/3">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
