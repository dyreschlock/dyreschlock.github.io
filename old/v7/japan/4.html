I had another mountain on my list of places to climb, and the day was still short since Funayama took a whole lot less time to climb than I thought it would.</p><p>I had lightly researched Mihakayama, so I knew where to start.  Mihakayama is the near the on-ramp for the highway.  Actually, part of the highway tunnels through the south end of the mountain.  The trail begins further up than that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail starts as an old service road for vehicles, but soon deteriorates from age and neglect.  At one point, the two tire tracks become a single trail no longer meant for vehicles.  And you become even more engulfed in the forest.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the climb continues, fallen trees cover the path.  The path itself is covered and hidden underneath the leaves of the other trees.  The trail is rather manageable, but there were some steep parts of the trail where I slipped because of the abundance of leaves.</p><p>The climb was separated into two parts.  The first part was the direct ascent from the parking space up the side of the mountain.  At the top of the spine, was a small camp site.  From there, the trail continued on the spine of the mountain until it reached the peak.  The trail alternated from facing west to facing east.</p><p>From the west, you could clearly see Kiyomi basking in the sun.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Facing east, the rest of Takayama started to become more and more clear.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the most, this was really the best the view could offer.  The peak was defined with a small shrine, and a post indicating that you’ve reached the top.  But, the view was completely obscured by trees.  A nice observation deck could be built, but the area is a bit too far out of the way for anyone to care about making one.</p><p>This climb is more about the journey, rather than the destination.  It was still a really nice day, though.</p><table><tr><td>?:??</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parking Spot</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.160066,137.210986" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.160066,137.210986">36°09'36.2"N 137°12'39.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Observation Point</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.165085,137.205002" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.165085,137.205002">36°09'54.3"N 137°12'18.0"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parking Spot</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.160066,137.210986" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.160066,137.210986">36°09'36.2"N 137°12'39.6"E</a></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Funayama 船山" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/funayama">Funayama 船山</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

As usual, I think I found out about this mountain from looking at Google Maps, then searching Google using the Japanese name to see if anyone posting something about hiking it before.  The photos I saw offered a decent view, so I thought it would be perfect to hike.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_8785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_8785.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_8785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_8785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_8785_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From the parking area, we were presenting with this map that included some helpful timeframes and how long the hike would take.</p><p>The trail was really clear and plainly laid out.

We had no idea what it was.  I went to Google Maps, switched it to satellite mode, and started looking around.  It was to the right of the Arkopia ski hill, and little further back behind the mountain.  Given that Arkopia was south-south-west from us, this structure was further in that direction.  We were able to find it, but there weren’t any labels.  <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.039206,137.230641" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.039206,137.230641">Here it is</a>.

We drove around a little bit to try and find the Mahikari shrine.  There was a gate entrance complete with security guards.  We had to sign in before we could drive to the shrine, after which we had a security tail.  When we reached the parking lot, we were met with another security guard that wouldn’t let us out of their site.  We could not take photos, but we were able to see the shrine up close.</p><p>After that, we went to the Arkopia ski hill, which was another location we saw from Takatawayama.  Looking past the ski lodge, we could see the peak, where we had been an hour earlier.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9172_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161103_takatawayama/IMG_9179_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, it was a really great hike.</p><table><tr><td>?:??</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parking Spot</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825">36°03'01.6"N 137°18'06.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Right-Split Rock <span class='ja'>右折れ岩</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Godzilla’s Spine <span class='ja'>ゴジラの背</span></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Observation Point</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.053908, 137.312544" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.053908, 137.312544">36°03'14.1"N 137°18'45.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>?:??</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Parking Spot</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.050436,137.301825">36°03'01.6"N 137°18'06.6"E</a></td></tr></table></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tengaizan 天蓋山" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tengaizan">Tengaizan 天蓋山</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 10, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><i>March 16th, 2018</i></p><p>Tengaizan had been on my bucket list of Hida mountains to climb for quite a while.  I read about it on the <a href="http://hidamoriaruki.com/map/tengai/" title="http://hidamoriaruki.com/map/tengai/">Hida-mori-aruki</a> website a while ago.  I had also seen the entrance every time I went to Yama-no-mura to do the half marathon up there.  I was waiting for some nice weather and a day free from work or kendo, and that day finally happened in October 2016.</p><p>Yama-no-mura is pretty far away from central Takayama, though.  First, you need to drive to Kamioka.  That’s about 45 minutes.  And then Yama-no-mura is another 30 or 45 minutes from there.</p><p>The weather was nice, but it was the day after it rained, so the ground was rather soft and moist.  The trees reflected this, too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6766_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were several steep areas of the hike where I had to use the rope to make the climb.  The hike wasn’t too long, but still took about an hour and a half to reach the summit from the parking area.  The first clear area was the Doruiato Ranch site, which was a 200m climb from the base, and about 370m up from where I parked.  I guess this flat area used to be a ranch back in the day?  It’s a bit high for horses.  Maybe they were ranching something else?</p><p>From the ranch, the rest of the trail ran along the ridge of the connecting mountains, and then went up to the peak of Tengaizan.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6801_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6787_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6821_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6901_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6838_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The peak offered a 360 view of the surrounding mountains.  But, since the morning, clouds had begun to come in and over the surrounding mountains.  Mountains were still visible looking north, but when looking to the south, you could barely see through the clouds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6871.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6871.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6871_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6871_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_6871_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think that’s in the direction of Takayama?</p><p>For a brief moment or two, the clouds cleared away to reveal Mt.

Climbing steep terrain can be pretty easy, but descending puts a lot of stress on the knees and calves.  I slipped once or twice, too.

Not too bad.  At the entrance to the hiking trails was a restaurant that served meals to rejuvenate hikers from their long day.

I looked on my phone, and it appeared to be Kamioka High School, but I wasn’t quite sure.  When reaching the bottom of the road leading to Yama-no-mura, I took a right and started going to Kamioka to try and find these buildings.</p><p>I took a little bit of searching around, but I was able to find them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7039_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They are marked on Google Maps, but I was sure if these buildings were what I saw from the mountain peak.  Seeing them up close confirmed that they were indeed.</p><p>It’s not conveniently located, though.  Any students that actually attend this school would have to live up here.  It didn’t seem like any dormitories were around here either.  So those students would have to live in town, which was another 10 minutes away.  There was a direct road, but it was quite far for someone to walk, especially in the winter.  It seems pretty rough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161010_tengaizan/IMG_7045_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tengaizan towers over Kamioka High School, but by this time, the clouds had completely covered it.

| April 22, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The scenery in Takayama is simply gorgeous.  It's hard to really capture everything in photos or videos.  I love living up here in the mountains.</p><p>One peculiar things about living while surrounded by mountains is that we tend to have 2 sunrises and 2 sunsets.  One where the sun crosses the mountains, and the other when it crosses the actual horizon.  It creates an extended dawn and dusk everyday.</p><p>I live at the base of Kitayama, one of the more prominent small mountains in Takayama.  It sits between my apartment and the downtown area of Takayama.  Usually when I go downtown to go to a drinking party, climbing up one side, and back down the other is faster than going around it.</p><p>It's the perfect location to see both sunrise and sunset.</p><div class='title'><b>Sunrise - April 19th, 2016</b></div><p>Looking east from Kitayama paints a perfect image of Mt. Norikura <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span>.  It's not the tallest mountain nearby, but it's easily the most recognizable.  Underneath the mountain is my neighborhood in Takayama, Sanfukuji <span class='ja'>三福寺</span>.</p><p>The weather report was perfect!  100% clear and beautiful.  I woke up before 5am, and went on top of Kitayama.  I set up my camera, and took the following time-lapse from 5:00 to 7:07.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEO5xQkjxvw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>My camera took 1085 photos.  Apparently 5am wasn't early enough, as it was already pretty light out when the time-lapse started.  Oh well, next time!</p><div class='title'><b>Sunset - November 4th, 2014</b></div><p>I took the sunset one just after I began messing with the time-lapse options available to me.  Looking west from Kitayama, you're able to see all of the downtown area of the city.  This time-lapse was from 3:49 to 5:53.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAvqBqwkP_0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>As soon as the sun dropped below the mountains, it turned from warm to cold.  Unfortunately, my camera ran out of batteries before it could get completely dark.</p><div class='title'><b>Equipment</b></div><p>In order to make these time-lapses, I needed 3 additionally things to go with my camera.  I bought a pretty cheap <b>tripod</b> at one of the second-hand stores in Toyama.  It's a bit flimsy, but it's nice, light, and easy to move around with.  I also needed to buy an <b>aperture</b>.  An aperture is a hand-dial you plug into your camera, and you tell it when to take photos.  With these, I can tell my camera to take a photos every 5-7 seconds.</p><p>For my time-lapse, I set the camera in HDR mode to try and capture as much of the scene as possible.  Then, I compiled all the photos together using <b>ffmpeg</b>.  FFmpeg is a command line application that will create a movie file from a sequential set of image files.  It can be a bit difficult to use, but I eventually figured out some decent options.  </p><p><code>ffmpeg -r 24 -i frame%04d.jpg -b:v 15000k -s hd1080 anoutput.mp4</code></p><p>I don't exactly remember what each term means, but it creates a 1080p video file that looks quite nice.  It does squish the image, though, rather than cropping it.  Close enough, though.  Before running this, I wrote a quick program to rename all my photo files to be sequential starting with 0000.</p><p>Here are the starting and finishing images of the compilations.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise0000_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0000_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunrise1084_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160419_timelapse/sunset0869_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The beginning and end of a day in the life of Takayama.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hanami in Takayama 花見" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hanami-in-takayama-2016">Hanami in Takayama 花見</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Perhaps the most attended event is the night procession.  Just after dusk, the 12 or 13 floats are pulled through the downtown area.  The float move through the "old" town, through the main road, and back through shopping area.</p><p>2 years ago, I wrote a fairly lengthy post about the festival, and details about each float.  Check that out here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.</p><p>I got to the festival a little late this year, but I was still able to see everything near the tail end of the route.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7407_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160414_festival/IMG_7424_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Above is the first float, and it seems to be the same float in both spring and fall festivals.

On the top of the float, sits a large drum with drummer on both sides.  Around the front and back are flutists playing the in unison with the other flutists paving the way.

| March 29, 2016 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After seeing The Cove, I had wanted to visit Taiji and see things for myself.  In 2011, when my brother and I came to Japan, we did sight-seeing around the Kansai region of Japan.  I looked into the logistics of being able to visit Taiji, but it was just too far out of the way, and quite expensive by train.  Driving was really the only sensible option.</p><p>Now that I live in Japan, and drive in Japan, I finally took the opportunity to go there.  Taiji is located on the southern end of the Kii peninsula, so the most sensible route will always enter the town from the north.  That's where I found that dolphin bridge from <a href="/old/v7/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama" title="/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama">the previous post</a>.  On the hill past the dolphin bridge are two large whale statues welcoming you to town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing along, the road curves around the coastline.  There's a shabby-looking, rundown hotel just before the road straightens out, and shoots straight forward to the whale museum and other attractions.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" /></a></p><p>The road is lined with palm trees, and a cement barricade blocking the crashing waves onto the land.  Some townspeople sat along the ends of the piers and cement walls trying to catch some fish.</p><p>At the end of the straight road was the Kyo Maru No. 1, a research and whaling vessel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" /></a></p><p>Nearby were large clamps.  After the "research" vessel fires enough harpoons into the whale to tire it down, and keep it from fighting, the metal contraption clamps into the whale's tail, and hauls it back from the ocean to land for their meat.</p><p>From here, I started roaming around town a little bit to figure out some locations.  I went passed the whaling museum, and saw the cove.  I continued on and went to the downtown area, found the city hall, and took photos overlooking the area.  I went back to the cove, and took those photos.  Then hiked up the northern surrounding mountain, which gave a nice view of the area.  Though, the cove was not visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After that, I spent some time at the Whale Museum, and then began to explore the southern area of the town.  There are several points along the coastline which housed ancient (and some modern) light houses.  Light house keepers had to stay in the light houses several days to make sure the fire continued to burn and illuminate the coastline, so each lighthouse had a small house or a dorm for the keeper.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The old wooden light houses were no longer there, but some locations still had the dorms.  One site had a modern light house in place of the old one.  This was the same site that had buildings for butchering and storing whale meat back in the day.  Hundreds of years ago, after a whale was defeated and dragged ashore, it sometimes took weeks to cut through the entire beast.</p><div class='title'><b>Pacific Ocean</b></div><p>I continued along the coastline of the ocean.

It offered a similar view as the other places, but had an unofficial trail leading down to the ocean.  There were some ropes set up to help hikers keep themselves from slipping and falling, but it wasn't too bad.</p><p>The edge of grass and dirt was met with a beach of rocks, smoothed and carved from the constant battering of ocean waves.  Every step unstable, and balancing on the moderately sized rocks piled onshore.

That's really only the building you see in front of you.

They did their tricks and got their small treats as rewards.</p><p>After watching <a href="/old/v7/the-cove" title="/the-cove">The Cove</a> all those years ago, I can't stop thinking about the well-being of these dolphins, or really any animal in captivity.  The Cove made mention that dolphins communicate and hear through echo-location and sound.  The subtle reverberations of their pings bouncing off walls and objects in the open water to give them a sense of location.</p><p>In a tank, they're obviously trapped and surrounded by sound.  What's worse is the sound of the announcer from the speakers blaring overhead.  And the crowd clapping and cheering them on.  It can be sensory overload for a dolphin or   a porpoise.  Many captive dolphins commit suicide, or damage themselves by ramming into the sides of their tank to try and make the pain go away.  At least, for ones caught in the wild.</p><p>I think there's some law enacted that states dolphins, orca, and other porpoises can no longer be caught in the wild for the porpoises of captivity because it's so damaging and harmful to them.  Only sea-mammals born and raised in captivity are allowed to be kept in captivity.  </p><p>This is probably directly because of their echo-location senses.  Being born and raised in captivity allows them to live with the noise their entire life, and adapt from the very beginning.  Though, this means they could never be released in the wild.  We've basically split their species on a different evolutionary path, much like dogs and wolves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But, they flip around and jump around, and everyone claps.  I wonder what actually compels these dolphins to obey.  They are just animals, but they're smarter than most.  Smarter than dogs.  I wonder if they have some kind of loyalty gene as well, and since we've had them in captivity long enough, those loyalty genes have been passed on to their offspring, continuing the cycle, breeding a more loyal dolphin.</p><p>At some point, this gets just as perverse as dog breeding.  Though, the real perversion of this place is to come.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Enclosed Bay</b></div><p>Passed the dolphin tanks is an enclosed bay connected to the ocean.

Successfully capturing and killing one of these massive creatures could easily feed the town for months.  Back in the day, whales used to come quite close the coast.  Hundreds of years ago, there were very few large ships patrolling the oceans, and there were all made of wood.  They were no mechanical noises to ward away the creatures of the sea.</p><p>The hunters of the village, would get into smaller boats (models shown above), and extend very large nets between multiple ships.  Once a whale was captured in the nets, and they could get close, the hunters repeatedly stabbed and skewered the beast with their spears.  Eventually wounding it enough, to be pulled onto the beach, and killed.</p><p>Such effort must have taken almost an entire day.  Even when killer whales kill a seal in the open ocean, it takes about 8 hours before they've beaten it enough for it to quit fighting back.

That kind of thing.</p><p>They had a brain, part of the heart, some of the kidney, a big pair of testicles, a tongue, and a few others.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6206.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6206.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6206_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6206_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6206_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6213.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6213.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6213_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column br"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6211.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6211_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6211_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6211_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6212.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6212.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6212_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6212_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6212_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>They also had a lot of bones, and skeletons.

It's how this town survived back in the day, and it's how they continue to survive today by selling the meat.  The idea of these traditions is very important in Japan, especially in small outlying towns.</p><p>By originally collecting these fetuses, they were able to further understand the animals they killed, how they relate to us, and how life works.  They mostly likely killed the mothers without realizing the pregnancy.  Using the fetuses gives them work insight into biological science.</p><p>Now in a museum, we can learn about how doctor from hundreds of years ago studied and learned about these creatures.  And child today can look directly at them, and instantly understand the process of life.  "Authentic" materials, as it were.  As I was taking photos, a 5 year old girl, and her older 8 year old brother turned the corner, saw the jars, and said, "Wow <span class='ja'>すごい</span>!"
