That's not really the case in Hida.  Not only is there still snow on the ground, but it still continues to snow!  It just snowed today, too.  As such we have our own regional "girl's" festival celebrating Hina Matsuri and the arrival of Spring called Ikibina Matsuri.

It's a collection of more than 30 old homes built 100 to 500 years ago from all around Hida.  These homes have very distinctive thatched roofs to protect against the harsh snow, and keep the warmth of the fire inside.  As these homes became abandoned, or their land would be renovated, the city of Takayama unearthed these houses, and moved them here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150312_hida/IMG_4735_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I went here on March 12th after another beautiful Spring snowfall.

We are completely surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the country, but there are plenty more low lying mountains standing above us.  Towards the end of summer, I became interested in hiking some the nearby mountains, and seeing our town from above, and had plenty success.  I wanted to hike during the winter to see the seasonal differences, and yesterday finally had great weather to do it.</p><p>I decided to hike Harayama <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>原山</span></span>, a mountain I had already hiked once before on <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">September 20th</a>.  It's probably the highest mountain nearest the center of Takayama, and it has a great view of the Shingu <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>新宮</span></span> neighborhood, and some of the downtown Takayama, too.</p><p>Harayama was one of the easiest hikes I did over last summer, and you can drive quite near the peak.  In winter, things were much different.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unfortunately, with the heavy snow we received <a href="/old/v7/december-snow" title="/december-snow" title="/december-snow">last December</a>, many of the trees lining the mountain pass had collapsed, blocking the road.  It was completely blocked only 100 or 200 meters from Hida no Sato <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>飛騨のさと</span></span>.</p><p>Several other cars had parked near the block, so I did the same.  I parked my car, and began my hike.</p><div class='title'><b>Walking to the Parking Area</b></div><p>I wasn't too worried since I had already hiked this area once before.  I knew the distance I needed to travel.  However, hiking in snow was WAY more difficult than I thought it would be, and there was a lot of damage from that December snowstorm that had not yet been cleaned up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I began by following the mountain road leading up to the parking area.  There was a path already laid out in the snow by previous hikers throughout the season.  A clear path of foot prints had packed down the snow, and created a frozen platform able to hold my weight.  Most of the time.  </p><p>Whenever I slightly veered off the course, I would sink in the unpacked snow.  Even sometimes the course itself wouldn't be able to hold my weight.  It would collapse, and I would sink in the snow.  Just like this:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow was still deep enough to sink past my knees.  My typical pace would be walking, walking, walking, sink, walking, walking, walking, sink.  It wasn't so bad at first.  I would usually leap out of the hole while I sank, and catch my balance.  But after doing this numerous times, the exercise began to wear on me.  And every time I sunk in the snow was a short little break.</p><p>I took plenty of breaks taking photos, too.  Also, I probably stopped every 2 or 3 minutes, to take in the beautiful snow covered scenery and snap several photos.</p><p>There were plenty of downed trees as well.  The first couple of trees were easy to duck under, but there were several just too big to hop over, and difficult to tell if I could actually go under.  It can became very clear that this hike was not a simple leisurely stroll.  Several of these trees, I had to actually crawl under in order to pass.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In addition to the road, there were hiking trails that went the exact same direction and several times passed the road.  I was getting sick of sinking in the snow every 10 or 20 feet, so I changed paths to the hiking trails at my next opportunity.  The trails had slightly less snow, and nearly all of its had been very well packed down.</p><p>But, this presented a new challenge.  The snow was packed so well, and so uniform that was nothing for my shoes to grip.  And the hiking trail was MUCH more vertical than the mountain road.  Now, I was constantly slipping at the most modest of inclines.  Towards the end of the trail as it crossed the road again, I was basically crawling my way up, and tearing through the outer edges of the ice into the snow.</p><p>Ugh, fuck that.  I'm going back to the snow.</p><p>I was one leg away from reaching the parking area, and the shelter came into view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Things got way worse.  At this point, way more hikers had used the trail, so the path of the road was much more narrow and weak.  Nearly every five steps, I sank into the snow, had to pull myself out, and then sink again.  I was taking a break almost every minute due to exhaustion.  As exhaustion continued, I became too lazy or tired to keep myself from fully falling into the snow.  The snow was nice and soft. :)</p><p>But I continued, and ripped through the snow.  Another hiker came into view, and heard me crunching through the snow.  He basically just stood there and stared at me like I was some kind of idiot as I continually sank in the snow, and running out of breath.  I said <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>こんにちは</span></span> to which I received a belated response.  Then he talked with me for a little while.  We had actually met before.  He worked at City Hall, and we met at one of those social events they have.  I didn't remember him at all.</p><p>He asked what my destination was, and I replied <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>たぶんここです</span></span> (maybe right here), but then later said I was planning on going to the summit.  He had just come from the summit, and said it would probably take about 30 minutes.  Yeah well, it had already taken me 40 minutes just to get here.  I guessed that with the current season, maybe 50 minutes was more accurate.  I mentioned I had hiked here before and knew the area, so while he may had tried to convince me to give up, he basically gave up, and wished me well.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing to the Temple</b></div><p>From the parking area, there are two paths to reach the summit: the high path, and the low path, the difficult path, and the easy path.  I took the low easy path.  During the summer, the high path was annoying.  I couldn't imagine how painful it would be now.</p><p>The low path leads directly to the Kannon Temple where they do the horse paintings near the end of summer.  From there, it was a straight descent to the summit.  The descent worried me, but covering over a kilometer on level terrain, then putting all the bullshit at the end seemed easier to tackle.</p><p>I put on my gloves, and continued forward.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were several ups and downs, and I sank in the snow fairly often, but it wasn't that bad.

The first leg of the trail was another 40 or 45 degree slope.  I sat on my feet, and zoomed straight down.

After a while, the trails began to even out.  I was no longer able to sled, so I stuck with the roads, and keep on the icy path.</p><p>At last, I arrived back to my car almost an hour after I left the summit.  What took me 2 hours to climb, took me only an hour to descend.  Sure, I wasn't taking nearly as many pictures, and gravity was on my side, but that's still a huge gain in speed.</p><p>My gloves were completely soaked from the snow, and my inner clothes were completely soaked from sweat.  I brought some extra clothes with, so I changed into something dry before leaving the area.</p><p>Before heading to my appointment at 2pm, I drove through the Shingu neighborhood to take a reverse photo looking at the summit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's really not that much to look at from below, but from the top everything looks amazing.</p><p>The summit is that open area near the top.

The clouds, fog, and snow stop mid-afternoon, and sky opens wide to allow the sun to say goodbye for the day.  The other night, I noticed some rather bright objects in the sky.  Usually, if you have to see a "star" that is WAY brighter than most, it's actually a planet.  And it definitely was.</p><p>I was witnessing an uncommon event where our view of both Venus and Mars were coming close to each other, and eventually Venus would overlap Mars, blocking it from view.  In addition, our view of the Moon also comes close to cross paths with the two planets and almost overlaps their view.  This was last Friday night.  I wish I would've been setup for it.</p><p>Tonight was the first clear night since then, so I went to the top of Kita-yama around 6:45pm, nearly 2 hours after sunset to take some photos.  Something else celestial was happening at that time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The International Space Station</b></div><p>At exactly 6:45pm, the ISS came into view in the Northwest sky.  It raced across the sky.  Then it set in the South.  Ever since <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon" title="/october-moon">the eclipse</a> last year, I signed up for NASA's Spot the Station service.  Here's the link: <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" title="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" title="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</a></p><p>Spot the Station was send you an email in the morning if the International Space Station happens to fly over head the coming night.  Just enter your email and location, and you're good for a year.  It's incredibly accurate.  It will tell you the exact date it will come into range, which direction in the night sky to look, and how long it will be visible.  Here's the email I got today:</p><p><code>Time: Tue Feb 24 6:45 PM, Visible: 5 min, Max Height: 55 degrees, Appears: WNW, Disappears: SSE</code></p><p>The station appears as a white dot in the sky and moves and a steady pace.  It makes no sound, and no visible trail.  You might think it was an airplane, but it's just a single light, and it's not blinking.  And then it disappears over some trees.  Gone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Moon</b></div><p>Luna is completely visible in the sky, too, illuminating nearly everything.

It takes about 2 hours to make it to the area, and between here and there are the western peaks of the Japanese Alps.  Half of the journey is using the smooth and fast Tollway.  </p><p>The second half is taking a narrow winding road that follows the outline of the mountains and the lakes and rivers their runoff have created.  On a chill clear February morning, it looks beautiful.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For a couple of days this year, we've had this amazing clear weather with absolutely no clouds in the sky.

Even back in the day, the setting would not be all that different.</p><p>It's unnatural.</p><p>Most Japanese castles sit on a mountain of rock laid by human hands, surrounded by castle walls and other towers and small buildings within the courtyard.  A castle isn't really a single building, but a center point of an entire complex, which, in turn, is usually the center point of an entire town.</p><p>The current structure labeled Katsuyama Castle is indeed unnatural.  According to the Internet, this is not its original location.  This building was built in 1992 by a successful and wealthy local who wanted to give something back to their hometown.

One of my only goals in Tokyo was to visit Tokyo Skytree with the amazing weather for the weekend.  I went there last year, but didn't take many photos.  I wanted to correct that this time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tokyo Skytree is now the tallest free standing tower in the world.  Construction finished in late 2012, and it was built to accommodate the much wider-band television broadcasts for the high definition age that Tokyo Tower could not longer support.  As such, Tokyo Skytree acts as a symbol of the future.  The same symbol <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower-2014" title="/tokyo-tower-2014" title="/tokyo-tower-2014">Tokyo Tower</a> was 55 years ago.  </p><p>Skytree reaches 634 meters into the sky, which dwarfs Tokyo Tower's 333 meters.  634 is very deliberate choice.  Using <a href="/old/v7/goroawase" title="/goroawase" title="/goroawase">goroawase</a>, the kanji of 634 <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>六三四</span></span> can be read as mu-sa-shi, which, apparently, is the old name for the neighborhood where Skytree stands.  Musashi is also the name of a famous samurai.  It probably has several other meanings, too.</p><p>I wanted to get there as early as possible, since the weather was supposed to get more cloudy as the day went on.  I left my hotel room around 7:30am to meet the 8:00 opening, but it took a lot longer to get there than I had thought.  I finally arrived at 9am, but it was still early enough to miss the crowds.  There was absolutely no line, which was astonishing to me considering the hour wait from last year.  I was in the observation decks by 9:10.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The first observation deck was at a height of 350 meters, already taller than Tokyo Tower.

The view from Tokyo Tower was probably amazing after its construction 60 years ago.  It's still amazing today, but many of the surrounding buildings have caught up to its height.  It's view is one amongst the city, rather than viewing it from above.</p><p>No other building in Tokyo comes close to the height of Skytree.  Every building is underneath its view.  So, It truly towers over the entire city.</p><p>The special observatory wraps around the outside of the tower with a slight incline.  You continue to climb until to reach the highest point in the tower.  Then it starts to decline back to the return elevatory.  I didn't spend too much more time in the tower after that.  On my way out, the place was completely packed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was at 11:00am.  When I arrived, two hours prior, there was absolutely no one here.  Maybe the shuttle buses didn't begin operation until after 9am or something.  I'm not quite sure why people wouldn't have come earlier to avoid this mess.</p><p>Outside, a few blocks away, I came across a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp">bootleg</a> merchandise shop.  Everything looked so cheap and crappy from the window that I did not inquire.</p><p>Anyway, there you go.  That's Tokyo Skytree.  It's pretty neat, though quite expensive.  Entrance is 2400<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>, and an additional 1200<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> to go to the special observatory.  I think it's worth it for a single visit, but not really for repeats.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sunset at Sunshine City 60" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sunset-at-sunshine-city-60">Sunset at Sunshine City 60</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 25, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>It's been about a month, but on Nov 16th, I took and passed my Shodan level Kendo examination. :D</p><p>I wrote a little bit about this leading up to the exam on <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  Shodan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>初段</span></span>, or "first dan", and the first level of dan mastery in Kendo.  Dan mastery is somewhat similar to the black belt scale in Karate.  So, achieving Shodan is similar to a first level black belt.  There are no belts or additional decoration used in Kendo, though.</p><p>Prior to dan mastery, there is kyuu mastery, which is reserved for beginners of Kendo, usually elementary students, and beginning junior high students.</p><div class='title'><b>Examination Day</b></div><p>The test was held at Big Arena on Sunday Nov 16th.  The doors to Big Arena opened at 8am, and there were plenty of students waiting by the doors before then.  Additionally, there were basketball and table tennis tournaments held that day, too.  The Kendo test was held in the martial arts hall within the complex.</p><p>As the doors opened, everyone filled into the building.  I went upstairs and into the testing area.  Several of the beginner students I practice with were there taking the Kyuu tests for the first time.  One of my former students was there taking the "second dan" test, ni-dan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>二段</span></span>.  I had been practicing with him for the past month in preparation. :)</p><p>Everyone registered for their respective tests, and paid their fees.  The Shodan test was almost 10000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> ($100).</p><div class='title'><b>Kyuu Examination <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>級審査</span></span></b></div><p>The Kyuu-level tests began at 9am.  They first began with correct execution of the Kendo waza techniques.  These are a series of moves performed with another test taker.  One acts as the attacker.  The other as the defender.  Then when complete they switch roles.  These are performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>木刀</span></span> (wooden sword), and without any protective gear.  The moves are performed in a deliberate and methodical way to correctly show one's understanding of how the move is to be correctly executed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" /></p><p>Secondly, the test takers are evaluated on moves performed in real-time.  These moves are performed with all the gear worn by the test taker, and with a shinai <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>竹刀</span></span> (bamboo sword).  Same as the first test, test takers perform these moves on each other.  One is the attacker.  The other is the defender.  Then they switch.  Additionally, for "first kyuu", or Ikkyuu <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>一級</span></span>, the test ends with both test takers performing as many moves as they can against each other in a "practice" match.  The lower levels don't require this.</p><p>As the different kyuu-level tests complete, the results are posted on the wall, the taker's kendo licenses are stamped and certificates are handed out.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Examination <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>段審査</span></span></b></div><p>Once all the Kyuu tests were complete, then the Dan tests finally began.  I think our tests began 10:30.  There are 3 tests, and each is immediate elimination.  Meaning: if you fail a test, you do not continue.  I was most worried about the first test.</p><p>The first test is a practice shiai <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>試合</span></span>, or match, but it's performed much differently than in a tournament.  In this match, when you meet your opponent, you carefully study their posture, their movements, and their feelings.  When you understand your opponent, then you can interpret intentions, and correctly strike and respond to their movements.  </p><p>My biggest problem with doing this part of the test is my bulky slow-ass giant body.  These junior high kids are way too fast for me.  For some students, I can see their attacks coming, but I can't parry and counter fast enough to make a valid strike.  Other times, I can't even see their attacks coming because they whip around their shinai so fast.</p><p>This test isn't about winning or losing, though.  Reading your opponent is certainly key.  But more important is that you follow through with your movements to completion.  At least, that's how I understand it.  I think there are other factors at play, too.</p><p>For this test, examinees perform twice against two other examinees, and each match is one minute.  That's it.  As usual, I was in the last group.  I took my turn, and performed the test as I understood it.  I was certainly nervous, but I had been practicing so much over the past 2 months, and regularly practicing with students of similar level that it really didn't bother me as much as it did during the previous test.  I knew what to do.</p><p>So, I passed the first part of the test without a problem.  I was slow a couple of times, but I guess I was sufficient where it mattered.</p><div class='title'><b>Part 2 and 3</b></div><p>After more than an hour lunch break, we continued the test with the reminder of the test takers.  All the kyuu-level examinees were already gone at this point, so the crowd of parents was pretty sparse.</p><p>Part 2 is correctly performing dan-level waza, which are higher-level kendo techniques performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>木刀</span></span>.  I had been practicing these so much over the previous 3-4 months that they were completely internalized.  All the kendo instructors kept putting such an importance on them that I don't think I could ever forgot them.  During the test, though, we only needed to perform one side of the waza.  We were random chosen to either be attacker or defender, and that was it.  All examinees passed.</p><p>Part 3 of the test was the written exam.  This is what I wrote about before: <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  There are 4 questions total on the test chosen from a pool of 6.  Each examinee basically needed to memorize the answer, and write it down on the test.  You didn't need to write it in your own words.  And didn't need to write anything dealing with comprehension.  Only memorization.  (In my opinion, that doesn't really teach anything, but whatever.)</p><p>My written test was completely in English because I'm terrible at Japanese.  The English answers for the test were somewhat based on my translation of the booklet, too, so memorizing the answers was pretty easy (since they were written in my voice).  I was able to completely memorize the 6 questions within two days on the test.  Apparently, when grading my test, the proctor had commented that I had written everything 100% perfect.</p><p>So, I passed. :)  So too did everyone else that made it to this point.</p><p>I am one of perhaps ten or twenty foreigners to ever take and pass the Shodan exam in Gifu-ken.</p><div class='title'><b>Success!</b></div><p>I was rather nervous about whether I could pass the test, but a lot of that nervousness turned into confidence as the test drew closer.  I had been training every day leading up to the test, and was doing everything nearly perfect during practice.  My waza was totally perfect a few weeks prior to the test.  And I knew I could memorize the written part.  This was my third time taking a kendo exam, too, so I knew what to expect, and how to deal with things.  I didn't want to be too confident and have that turn to arrogance...  but I knew I could pass.  </p><p>Some of the student's parents were pretty confident I could pass as well.  They called the newspaper prior to the test so they could interview me and write an article about me.  The reporter asked me rather standard questions.  "How do you feel?" "How long have you done Kendo?" "Why do you do Kendo?" etc.  They asked my Kendo instructor questions as well.</p><p>It appeared in the Takayama newspaper the next day:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This brought me plenty of attention.</p><p>My student's parents read the newspaper, and noticed me.  The next day at school, all the students made comments about it, and congratulated me.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ジム先生、初段におめでとう</span></span>!  Some parents made their kids memorize their congratulations in English, and recite it to me.  Several teachers made a big deal out of it, too, making the whole class congratulate me before we started.  Plenty of students knew that I practiced and performed Kendo after school, but now everyone knew.</p><p>On Friday, a reporter from the Hida section of the Gifu newspaper wanted to write an article of their own.  They came to school, and interviewed me for about an hour.  She asked the same questions, but with more depth.</p><p>Again, the next day, it appeared in the paper:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between both these articles, I don't actually know the extent of what they wrote, since I'm terrible at Japanese.  It's also difficult for me to fully articulate myself when I can't do it in Japanese, and the person doesn't completely understand English.  As such, I don't think my responses were really all that interesting.  Nor can I really tell if they printed some shit about me.  (I did notice in the first article that I'm from Australia.)</p><p>This newspaper reaches A LOT more people than the Takayama paper.  Plus, it was the top story in this section of the newspaper, and it took up about a quarter of the page.</p><p>Now, everyone in my daily life knew that I did Kendo, and couldn't wait to congratulate me.  Teachers in other schools that I hadn't met, congratulated me.  The employees working at the convenience stores, grocery stores, gas station, and dry cleaning places I regularly visit, all recognized me in the paper and congratulated me the next time I went there.  Even the delivery man made a comment after dropping off a package.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>いつもおめでとう</span></span>.  <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>剣道をがんばってましょう</span></span>.</p><p>It wasn't that I hated the attention.  I mean, I already stand out quite a bit as a foreigner, which gives me attention on its own.  This is now yet another way of people paying attention to me.  Too much attention.  It was all positive attention, though, so I'm thankful for that. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Kendo continues to be amazing for me in Takayama, so I will absolutely continue to improve myself, and climb the rankings ladder.  After shodan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>初段</span></span>, the next level of mastery is nidan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>二段</span></span>, or "second dan."  The rules of ranking prohibit anyone from taking the nidan exam until one year after achieving shodan.  So, I won't be able to get nidan until November 2015.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, maybe 10 or 20 foreigners have gotten shodan in Gifu in the past.  Maybe 1 or 2 have gotten nidan.  None have ever gotten sandan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>三段</span></span> (third dan).  I don't think that's necessarily because of a skill-gap, or difficulty gap (though, I could be wrong.)  Nidan seems almost identical to Shodan, with the addition of more waza, and some different questions on the test.</p><p>I think the biggest gap is time.  Most ALTs only stay in Japan for 3 years at the most.  It's not that usual for someone to stay 4 or 5 years (which is the absolute max).  Between shodan and nidan, you must wait a year.  Between nidan and sandan, you must wait 2 years.  At this point, if I pass my nidan test next year, and stay for a 5th year, my sandan test would be after my contract is finished in Takayama.  I'm not sure where I'll be in November 2017, but it won't be Takayama.</p><p>I definitely plan on getting nidan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>二段</span></span> next year.  From there, I plan on continuing Kendo all the way up until I leave Takayama.  Hopefully where I am after, I will have the means to continue, then return to Takayama for the sandan test.  Who knows, though.  A lot can happen in the next 2 1/2 years.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to After the December Blizzard" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/december-snow-2">After the December Blizzard</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

By the time I went to bed last night, I was still snowing a little bit.  But, this morning, the snow was done, and the sky was beginning to clear.</p><p>According to the news, by 3pm yesterday, the mountains in Niigata had received the most snowfall at 200 centimeters.  Mountainous areas of Nagano, Fukushima, Gunma, and Fukui had received between 150 and 180 centimeters at the most.  (Easy conversion:  100 cm = 1 m =~ 1 yard = 3 feet).</p><p>Locally, the Hida area and Gujo city received plenty of snow, too.  Hida Kawai received 136 centimeters since 3pm yesterday.  Shirotori in Gujo got 131, and Shirakawa-go had gotten 125.  In Takayama, we got about 120cm, maybe.  Meanwhile, Gifu City (in the south) got only 6 centimeters.  Unfortunately, within the Hida region and Gujo city limits, about 7770 households are without power, which means they have no heat.  Some of the more outlying schools are still closed this morning, too.</p><p>After waking up this morning, I peaked outside, and the clouds around Norikura began to clear.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On my way to work, the sun climbed over the mountains, and brightly lit Norikura (above).</p><p>I'm in Kiyomi today.

According to the Internet, we've received about 85 cm since this time yesterday.  And by this time yesterday, teachers were convinced that amount had already fallen.  It certainly doesn't seem like we've accumulated nearly 5 feet of snow, but I guess it's possible.</p><p>Takayama City actually canceled school today, which is almost unheard of.  For most teachers in Takayama, they can't remember a time of school ever being canceled due to snow.  (Though, they seem to cancel school pretty often for typhoons.)  Yesterday, school was let out early, too.</p><p>But!  While school is canceled, that doesn't mean it's a day off for the teachers.  We still must come to school because it's our job.  This morning I cleared more than a foot of snow off of my car, and had to shovel a path in front of my car in order to make it onto the road.  One of my neighbors had his car stuck and blocking traffic, too, so I helped push his car out of the ditch.  But I made it to school on time.  No problem.</p><p>At school, all of us teachers went outside, shoveled snow, and knocked snow off of the trees.  There was definitely more than 3 feet of snow piled up on the school grounds, so maybe we have accumulated 5 feet overall.  After that, we dispersed throughout the neighborhood to check for any "dangers".</p><p>Today, I'm at Minami Elementary School, which is located near the center of town near the train station.  Because this school is so centrally located, there are no buses.  All students walk to school, so when we check for "dangers", we're basically verifying that the routes students take to get to school are safe for the students to travel.  I guess I'm not sure what we were actually looking for.  Sinkholes?  Or downed power lines?  The routes I (and another teacher) checked were clear of those dangers.  Though, the snow was piled up so much that anyone walking was basically forced into the streets.  I figured that was pretty dangerous.</p><p>But whatever... Students weren't coming to school today anyhow.  As I walked around, I took several photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp"

the supermarket to the river and back.  Plenty of residents were outside shoveling snow, and clearing their cars and driveways.  We didn't see any kids, though, which was weird.  You'd think they'd be running around playing in the snow.  Though, I suppose the streets were pretty dangerous with oncoming traffic.</p><div class='title'><b>Shoveling Snow in Takayama</b></div><p>There is one big difference between shoveling snow in the Midwest and in Japan.  In the Midwest, you typically shovel snow from your driveway into your yard.  However, in Japan, there are no yards.  At least, not in the city area.  Thankfully, I live near a river.  So, when it snows enough to be shoveled, my whole neighborhood just shovels all the snow into the river.</p><p>During our neighborhood safety check, plenty of citizens were doing the same.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp"/></a></p><p>If you live near a river, you basically fill up one of those sleds with snow, drag it to the river, and chuck in it.  And repeat until complete.  Sometimes, residents will fill up a pickup truck with snow, and then drive to the river and dump it.</p><p>Another method for the more landlocked neighborhoods of Takayama is using the gutters on the sides of the roads.  There is enough water running in Takayama, that it never freezes.  Some neighborhoods open up the gutters running on the sides of the streets, and shove the snow inside.  The running water melts the snow, and carries it away.  These neighborhoods are usually tightly packed, so they don't really have a lot of snow to shovel anyway.  It's usually just the strip of sidewalk in front of their house.</p><p>One other method by the lazy residents of town is shoveling the snow into the street.  In a typical winter Takayama day, it snows throughout the night, and warms up a bit during the day.  The warmth during the day usually melts whatever snow collected on the roads overnight.  So by pushing the snow in the streets, cars will run over it, and the daily warmth will melt and get rid of it.  It's still lazy, though.</p><p>Anyway...  maybe the snow was stop tonight some time, and we'll actually have class tomorrow.  Or maybe not.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/9">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/japan/7">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
