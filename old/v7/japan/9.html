| February 22, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, some other ALTs and myself traveled westward to Fukui prefecture to visit the dinosaur museum, and the castle.  It takes about 2 hours to make it to the area, and between here and there are the western peaks of the Japanese Alps.  Half of the journey is using the smooth and fast Tollway.  </p><p>The second half is taking a narrow winding road that follows the outline of the mountains and the lakes and rivers their runoff have created.  On a chill clear February morning, it looks beautiful.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For a couple of days this year, we've had this amazing clear weather with absolutely no clouds in the sky.  The sky a deep blue, and all the surrounding mountains completely visible.  At night, every star in the star can be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>We stopped twice to take some photos along the mountain road.  This was along Lake Kuzuryu <span class='ja'>九頭竜湖</span> still east of the village Kuzuryu <span class='ja'>九頭竜</span>.  Kelly pointed out that kanji stands for 9 <span class='ja'>九</span> + Head <span class='ja'>頭</span> + Dragon <span class='ja'>竜</span>.  I'm sure some poet hundreds of years ago, thought the rivers and the waterfalls (at the time) looked like a 9 headed serpent, then gave the area this name.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_2925_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3003_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We continued down the mountain.  We reached Ono, and headed north to the Dinosaur museum in Katsuyama City.  After which, we went to Katsuyama Castle.</p><div class='title'><b>Katsuyama Castle <span class='ja'>勝山城</span></b></div><p>It was later in the day, and clouds began to disrupt the clear blue sky. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3481_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Katsuyama Castle is an incredibly visible building on the side of the main road between Katsuyama and Ono.  It's very easy to park and gain access.  Today it sits next to acres of farmland and rice fields.  Even back in the day, the setting would not be all that different.</p><p>It's unnatural.</p><p>Most Japanese castles sit on a mountain of rock laid by human hands, surrounded by castle walls and other towers and small buildings within the courtyard.  A castle isn't really a single building, but a center point of an entire complex, which, in turn, is usually the center point of an entire town.</p><p>The current structure labeled Katsuyama Castle is indeed unnatural.  According to the Internet, this is not its original location.  This building was built in 1992 by a successful and wealthy local who wanted to give something back to their hometown.  Apparently this whole thing cost around $70 million.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The whole thing is very ornamental, too.  It feels no where near as authentic as most castles you might visit.  I can imagine many local citizens feel this is a blight on their natural landscape.</p><div class='title'><b>Observation Deck</b></div><p>But the view is quite gorgeous. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3516_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3516_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3516_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3516_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3516_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Immediately after entering the Castle, you are whisked away to the top floor via escalator to view all of south-eastern Katsuyama.  All the farmland the eye can see. :)</p><p>To north, north-west is downtown Katsuyama.  Directly to the north is Seidaiji, a very famous buddhist temple.  Just a little more further north is the Dinosaur museum, but the mountain is blocking the view.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3534.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3534.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3534_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3534_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3534_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3532.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3532.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3532_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3532_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3532_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>To the east is Kyougatake <span class='ja'>経ヶ岳</span>, one of the prominent western-most mountains of the Japanese Alps.

But the atmosphere is much different.  There are more mountains in Takayama, but they don't seem as dynamic as these.  </p><p>I think that's because Katsuyama isn't really a mountain town.  It is MUCH closer to sea level than Takayama.  Takayama rests high up in the clouds amidst the mountains.  They don't look as dynamic because we are among them.  We live on a plateau.  Katsuyama is down deep.  The mountains rose around the city, and was not lifted with them.</p><div class='title'><b>Samurai Armor</b></div><p>We continued our slow descent down the castle to each of the 5 remaining floors of the tour.  Each floor housed artwork, and artifacts from the time period.  This museum had an impression display of samurai armor.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3619.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3619.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3619_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3619_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3619_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Nearly half the third floor was devoted to these cases of armor.  There were a lot more than I've seen in other castle museums.  Overall 16 sets of armor (I think) are displayed in this museum.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3623.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3623_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3623_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3638.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3638.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3638_t.webp" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3628.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3628.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3628_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3628_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3628_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3643.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3643.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3643_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3643_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3643_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>I'm guessing these were used by local generals during the warring states period, but I don't really know.

We left and took some picture some outside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3668.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3668.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3668_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3668_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3668_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's definitely a beautiful looking castle, but its beauty feels somewhat shallow.  It seemed like the art, the glamor and the flare was put front first, and the history that created these beautiful structures and the times they lived in were put second (or maybe even third).  The fourth floor has some history, but it was just some stuff loosely tied together with history.</p><p>I've been in castle museums before where the entire lineage of the castle owners were catalogued, and spread throughout the course of the museum, along with artifacts showcasing that history.  I've been in other castle museums which had tons of interactive exhibits, dioramas, and tons of history displayed and explained in ways meant to inspire school children into learning about the history of their country.</p><p>Katsuyama Castle just seems like some rich person's collection.  Their hobby.  I don't think Katsuyama will inspire anyone about the history, other than its looks.  And even then, its fake facade seems to tear down the authenticity of its design.</p><p>It does look pretty, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3689_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3689_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3689_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3689_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3689_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Entry was 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tokyo Skytree 東京スカイツリー" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tokyo-sky-tree">Tokyo Skytree 東京スカイツリー</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 30, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Before returning to the states for winter vacation, I stayed in Tokyo for a full day.  One of my only goals in Tokyo was to visit Tokyo Skytree with the amazing weather for the weekend.  I went there last year, but didn't take many photos.  I wanted to correct that this time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tokyo Skytree is now the tallest free standing tower in the world.  Construction finished in late 2012, and it was built to accommodate the much wider-band television broadcasts for the high definition age that Tokyo Tower could not longer support.  As such, Tokyo Skytree acts as a symbol of the future.  The same symbol <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower-2014" title="/tokyo-tower-2014">Tokyo Tower</a> was 55 years ago.  </p><p>Skytree reaches 634 meters into the sky, which dwarfs Tokyo Tower's 333 meters.  634 is very deliberate choice.  Using <a href="/old/v7/goroawase" title="/goroawase">goroawase</a>, the kanji of 634 <span class='ja'>六三四</span> can be read as mu-sa-shi, which, apparently, is the old name for the neighborhood where Skytree stands.  Musashi is also the name of a famous samurai.  It probably has several other meanings, too.</p><p>I wanted to get there as early as possible, since the weather was supposed to get more cloudy as the day went on.  I left my hotel room around 7:30am to meet the 8:00 opening, but it took a lot longer to get there than I had thought.  I finally arrived at 9am, but it was still early enough to miss the crowds.  There was absolutely no line, which was astonishing to me considering the hour wait from last year.  I was in the observation decks by 9:10.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The first observation deck was at a height of 350 meters, already taller than Tokyo Tower.  The weather was starting to get cloudy, but the view was still amazing and clear.  In fact, if you looked towards the west, the weather was clear enough to view Mt. Fuji.  It was still rather feint, but totally visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9754_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Further up, there's a second observation tower at 450 meters, but there really isn't much difference between the two views.

The view from Tokyo Tower was probably amazing after its construction 60 years ago.  It's still amazing today, but many of the surrounding buildings have caught up to its height.  It's view is one amongst the city, rather than viewing it from above.</p><p>No other building in Tokyo comes close to the height of Skytree.  Every building is underneath its view.  So, It truly towers over the entire city.</p><p>The special observatory wraps around the outside of the tower with a slight incline.  You continue to climb until to reach the highest point in the tower.  Then it starts to decline back to the return elevatory.  I didn't spend too much more time in the tower after that.  On my way out, the place was completely packed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was at 11:00am.  When I arrived, two hours prior, there was absolutely no one here.  Maybe the shuttle buses didn't begin operation until after 9am or something.  I'm not quite sure why people wouldn't have come earlier to avoid this mess.</p><p>Outside, a few blocks away, I came across a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp">bootleg</a> merchandise shop.  Everything looked so cheap and crappy from the window that I did not inquire.</p><p>Anyway, there you go.  That's Tokyo Skytree.  It's pretty neat, though quite expensive.  Entrance is 2400<span class='ja'>円</span>, and an additional 1200<span class='ja'>円</span> to go to the special observatory.  I think it's worth it for a single visit, but not really for repeats.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sunset at Sunshine City 60" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sunset-at-sunshine-city-60">Sunset at Sunshine City 60</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 25, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It's been about a month, but on Nov 16th, I took and passed my Shodan level Kendo examination. :D</p><p>I wrote a little bit about this leading up to the exam on <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  Shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, or "first dan", and the first level of dan mastery in Kendo.  Dan mastery is somewhat similar to the black belt scale in Karate.  So, achieving Shodan is similar to a first level black belt.  There are no belts or additional decoration used in Kendo, though.</p><p>Prior to dan mastery, there is kyuu mastery, which is reserved for beginners of Kendo, usually elementary students, and beginning junior high students.</p><div class='title'><b>Examination Day</b></div><p>The test was held at Big Arena on Sunday Nov 16th.  The doors to Big Arena opened at 8am, and there were plenty of students waiting by the doors before then.  Additionally, there were basketball and table tennis tournaments held that day, too.  The Kendo test was held in the martial arts hall within the complex.</p><p>As the doors opened, everyone filled into the building.  I went upstairs and into the testing area.  Several of the beginner students I practice with were there taking the Kyuu tests for the first time.  One of my former students was there taking the "second dan" test, ni-dan <span class='ja'>二段</span>.  I had been practicing with him for the past month in preparation. :)</p><p>Everyone registered for their respective tests, and paid their fees.  The Shodan test was almost 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($100).</p><div class='title'><b>Kyuu Examination <span class='ja'>級審査</span></b></div><p>The Kyuu-level tests began at 9am.  They first began with correct execution of the Kendo waza techniques.  These are a series of moves performed with another test taker.  One acts as the attacker.  The other as the defender.  Then when complete they switch roles.  These are performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span> (wooden sword), and without any protective gear.  The moves are performed in a deliberate and methodical way to correctly show one's understanding of how the move is to be correctly executed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/IMG_4202.webp" /></p><p>Secondly, the test takers are evaluated on moves performed in real-time.  These moves are performed with all the gear worn by the test taker, and with a shinai <span class='ja'>竹刀</span> (bamboo sword).  Same as the first test, test takers perform these moves on each other.  One is the attacker.  The other is the defender.  Then they switch.  Additionally, for "first kyuu", or Ikkyuu <span class='ja'>一級</span>, the test ends with both test takers performing as many moves as they can against each other in a "practice" match.  The lower levels don't require this.</p><p>As the different kyuu-level tests complete, the results are posted on the wall, the taker's kendo licenses are stamped and certificates are handed out.</p><div class='title'><b>Dan Examination <span class='ja'>段審査</span></b></div><p>Once all the Kyuu tests were complete, then the Dan tests finally began.  I think our tests began 10:30.  There are 3 tests, and each is immediate elimination.  Meaning: if you fail a test, you do not continue.  I was most worried about the first test.</p><p>The first test is a practice shiai <span class='ja'>試合</span>, or match, but it's performed much differently than in a tournament.  In this match, when you meet your opponent, you carefully study their posture, their movements, and their feelings.  When you understand your opponent, then you can interpret intentions, and correctly strike and respond to their movements.  </p><p>My biggest problem with doing this part of the test is my bulky slow-ass giant body.  These junior high kids are way too fast for me.  For some students, I can see their attacks coming, but I can't parry and counter fast enough to make a valid strike.  Other times, I can't even see their attacks coming because they whip around their shinai so fast.</p><p>This test isn't about winning or losing, though.  Reading your opponent is certainly key.  But more important is that you follow through with your movements to completion.  At least, that's how I understand it.  I think there are other factors at play, too.</p><p>For this test, examinees perform twice against two other examinees, and each match is one minute.  That's it.  As usual, I was in the last group.  I took my turn, and performed the test as I understood it.  I was certainly nervous, but I had been practicing so much over the past 2 months, and regularly practicing with students of similar level that it really didn't bother me as much as it did during the previous test.  I knew what to do.</p><p>So, I passed the first part of the test without a problem.  I was slow a couple of times, but I guess I was sufficient where it mattered.</p><div class='title'><b>Part 2 and 3</b></div><p>After more than an hour lunch break, we continued the test with the reminder of the test takers.  All the kyuu-level examinees were already gone at this point, so the crowd of parents was pretty sparse.</p><p>Part 2 is correctly performing dan-level waza, which are higher-level kendo techniques performed with a bokutou <span class='ja'>木刀</span>.  I had been practicing these so much over the previous 3-4 months that they were completely internalized.  All the kendo instructors kept putting such an importance on them that I don't think I could ever forgot them.  During the test, though, we only needed to perform one side of the waza.  We were random chosen to either be attacker or defender, and that was it.  All examinees passed.</p><p>Part 3 of the test was the written exam.  This is what I wrote about before: <a href="/old/v7/kendo-exam-question-workbook" title="/kendo-exam-question-workbook">Sept 11th</a>.  There are 4 questions total on the test chosen from a pool of 6.  Each examinee basically needed to memorize the answer, and write it down on the test.  You didn't need to write it in your own words.  And didn't need to write anything dealing with comprehension.  Only memorization.  (In my opinion, that doesn't really teach anything, but whatever.)</p><p>My written test was completely in English because I'm terrible at Japanese.  The English answers for the test were somewhat based on my translation of the booklet, too, so memorizing the answers was pretty easy (since they were written in my voice).  I was able to completely memorize the 6 questions within two days on the test.  Apparently, when grading my test, the proctor had commented that I had written everything 100% perfect.</p><p>So, I passed. :)  So too did everyone else that made it to this point.</p><p>I am one of perhaps ten or twenty foreigners to ever take and pass the Shodan exam in Gifu-ken.</p><div class='title'><b>Success!</b></div><p>I was rather nervous about whether I could pass the test, but a lot of that nervousness turned into confidence as the test drew closer.  I had been training every day leading up to the test, and was doing everything nearly perfect during practice.  My waza was totally perfect a few weeks prior to the test.  And I knew I could memorize the written part.  This was my third time taking a kendo exam, too, so I knew what to expect, and how to deal with things.  I didn't want to be too confident and have that turn to arrogance...  but I knew I could pass.  </p><p>Some of the student's parents were pretty confident I could pass as well.  They called the newspaper prior to the test so they could interview me and write an article about me.  The reporter asked me rather standard questions.  "How do you feel?" "How long have you done Kendo?" "Why do you do Kendo?" etc.  They asked my Kendo instructor questions as well.</p><p>It appeared in the Takayama newspaper the next day:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan001_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This brought me plenty of attention.</p><p>My student's parents read the newspaper, and noticed me.  The next day at school, all the students made comments about it, and congratulated me.  <span class='ja'>ジム先生、初段におめでとう</span>!  Some parents made their kids memorize their congratulations in English, and recite it to me.  Several teachers made a big deal out of it, too, making the whole class congratulate me before we started.  Plenty of students knew that I practiced and performed Kendo after school, but now everyone knew.</p><p>On Friday, a reporter from the Hida section of the Gifu newspaper wanted to write an article of their own.  They came to school, and interviewed me for about an hour.  She asked the same questions, but with more depth.</p><p>Again, the next day, it appeared in the paper:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_kendo/kendoscan002_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Between both these articles, I don't actually know the extent of what they wrote, since I'm terrible at Japanese.  It's also difficult for me to fully articulate myself when I can't do it in Japanese, and the person doesn't completely understand English.  As such, I don't think my responses were really all that interesting.  Nor can I really tell if they printed some shit about me.  (I did notice in the first article that I'm from Australia.)</p><p>This newspaper reaches A LOT more people than the Takayama paper.  Plus, it was the top story in this section of the newspaper, and it took up about a quarter of the page.</p><p>Now, everyone in my daily life knew that I did Kendo, and couldn't wait to congratulate me.  Teachers in other schools that I hadn't met, congratulated me.  The employees working at the convenience stores, grocery stores, gas station, and dry cleaning places I regularly visit, all recognized me in the paper and congratulated me the next time I went there.  Even the delivery man made a comment after dropping off a package.  <span class='ja'>いつもおめでとう</span>.  <span class='ja'>剣道をがんばってましょう</span>.</p><p>It wasn't that I hated the attention.  I mean, I already stand out quite a bit as a foreigner, which gives me attention on its own.  This is now yet another way of people paying attention to me.  Too much attention.  It was all positive attention, though, so I'm thankful for that. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Kendo continues to be amazing for me in Takayama, so I will absolutely continue to improve myself, and climb the rankings ladder.  After shodan <span class='ja'>初段</span>, the next level of mastery is nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span>, or "second dan."  The rules of ranking prohibit anyone from taking the nidan exam until one year after achieving shodan.  So, I won't be able to get nidan until November 2015.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, maybe 10 or 20 foreigners have gotten shodan in Gifu in the past.  Maybe 1 or 2 have gotten nidan.  None have ever gotten sandan <span class='ja'>三段</span> (third dan).  I don't think that's necessarily because of a skill-gap, or difficulty gap (though, I could be wrong.)  Nidan seems almost identical to Shodan, with the addition of more waza, and some different questions on the test.</p><p>I think the biggest gap is time.  Most ALTs only stay in Japan for 3 years at the most.  It's not that usual for someone to stay 4 or 5 years (which is the absolute max).  Between shodan and nidan, you must wait a year.  Between nidan and sandan, you must wait 2 years.  At this point, if I pass my nidan test next year, and stay for a 5th year, my sandan test would be after my contract is finished in Takayama.  I'm not sure where I'll be in November 2017, but it won't be Takayama.</p><p>I definitely plan on getting nidan <span class='ja'>二段</span> next year.  From there, I plan on continuing Kendo all the way up until I leave Takayama.  Hopefully where I am after, I will have the means to continue, then return to Takayama for the sandan test.  Who knows, though.  A lot can happen in the next 2 1/2 years.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to After the December Blizzard" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/december-snow-2">After the December Blizzard</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

But, this morning, the snow was done, and the sky was beginning to clear.</p><p>According to the news, by 3pm yesterday, the mountains in Niigata had received the most snowfall at 200 centimeters.  Mountainous areas of Nagano, Fukushima, Gunma, and Fukui had received between 150 and 180 centimeters at the most.  (Easy conversion:  100 cm = 1 m =~ 1 yard = 3 feet).</p><p>Locally, the Hida area and Gujo city received plenty of snow, too.  Hida Kawai received 136 centimeters since 3pm yesterday.  Shirotori in Gujo got 131, and Shirakawa-go had gotten 125.  In Takayama, we got about 120cm, maybe.  Meanwhile, Gifu City (in the south) got only 6 centimeters.  Unfortunately, within the Hida region and Gujo city limits, about 7770 households are without power, which means they have no heat.  Some of the more outlying schools are still closed this morning, too.</p><p>After waking up this morning, I peaked outside, and the clouds around Norikura began to clear.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On my way to work, the sun climbed over the mountains, and brightly lit Norikura (above).</p><p>I'm in Kiyomi today.

| December 18, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>It has been snowing for 3 days straight in the city of Takayama.  According to the Internet, we've received about 85 cm since this time yesterday.  And by this time yesterday, teachers were convinced that amount had already fallen.  It certainly doesn't seem like we've accumulated nearly 5 feet of snow, but I guess it's possible.</p><p>Takayama City actually canceled school today, which is almost unheard of.  For most teachers in Takayama, they can't remember a time of school ever being canceled due to snow.  (Though, they seem to cancel school pretty often for typhoons.)  Yesterday, school was let out early, too.</p><p>But!  While school is canceled, that doesn't mean it's a day off for the teachers.  We still must come to school because it's our job.  This morning I cleared more than a foot of snow off of my car, and had to shovel a path in front of my car in order to make it onto the road.  One of my neighbors had his car stuck and blocking traffic, too, so I helped push his car out of the ditch.  But I made it to school on time.  No problem.</p><p>At school, all of us teachers went outside, shoveled snow, and knocked snow off of the trees.  There was definitely more than 3 feet of snow piled up on the school grounds, so maybe we have accumulated 5 feet overall.  After that, we dispersed throughout the neighborhood to check for any "dangers".</p><p>Today, I'm at Minami Elementary School, which is located near the center of town near the train station.  Because this school is so centrally located, there are no buses.  All students walk to school, so when we check for "dangers", we're basically verifying that the routes students take to get to school are safe for the students to travel.  I guess I'm not sure what we were actually looking for.  Sinkholes?  Or downed power lines?  The routes I (and another teacher) checked were clear of those dangers.  Though, the snow was piled up so much that anyone walking was basically forced into the streets.  I figured that was pretty dangerous.</p><p>But whatever... Students weren't coming to school today anyhow.  As I walked around, I took several photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp"/></a></p><p>We basically just cover the north-western blocks from the school to the supermarket to the river and back.  Plenty of residents were outside shoveling snow, and clearing their cars and driveways.  We didn't see any kids, though, which was weird.  You'd think they'd be running around playing in the snow.  Though, I suppose the streets were pretty dangerous with oncoming traffic.</p><div class='title'><b>Shoveling Snow in Takayama</b></div><p>There is one big difference between shoveling snow in the Midwest and in Japan.  In the Midwest, you typically shovel snow from your driveway into your yard.  However, in Japan, there are no yards.  At least, not in the city area.  Thankfully, I live near a river.  So, when it snows enough to be shoveled, my whole neighborhood just shovels all the snow into the river.</p><p>During our neighborhood safety check, plenty of citizens were doing the same.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp"/></a></p><p>If you live near a river, you basically fill up one of those sleds with snow, drag it to the river, and chuck in it.  And repeat until complete.  Sometimes, residents will fill up a pickup truck with snow, and then drive to the river and dump it.</p><p>Another method for the more landlocked neighborhoods of Takayama is using the gutters on the sides of the roads.  There is enough water running in Takayama, that it never freezes.  Some neighborhoods open up the gutters running on the sides of the streets, and shove the snow inside.  The running water melts the snow, and carries it away.  These neighborhoods are usually tightly packed, so they don't really have a lot of snow to shovel anyway.  It's usually just the strip of sidewalk in front of their house.</p><p>One other method by the lazy residents of town is shoveling the snow into the street.  In a typical winter Takayama day, it snows throughout the night, and warms up a bit during the day.  The warmth during the day usually melts whatever snow collected on the roads overnight.  So by pushing the snow in the streets, cars will run over it, and the daily warmth will melt and get rid of it.  It's still lazy, though.</p><p>Anyway...  maybe the snow was stop tonight some time, and we'll actually have class tomorrow.  Or maybe not.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter">From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I drove down to Nagoya to listen to some music.  Nagoya is almost directly south from Takayama.  When taking the Express Way, it's pretty much direct.  Just go south, and you're nearly there.  It's about a 2 1/2 hour drive, so I compare it to a drive from Madison, WI to Chicago.</p><p>However, there is one huge difference between those two drives:  <b>elevation</b>.  Takayama sits in an open plateau on the west end of the Japanese alps surrounded by some of the tallest mountains in Japan.  Nagoya is a port city near the Pacific Ocean.  So while the temperature drops, and the snow begins to fall in Takayama, it's still Autumn down in Nagoya.</p><p>And the drive between Takayama and Nagoya highlights these seasonal changes in a mere 2 hour span.  I took photos on the way down, and on the way back.  Here's my trip on the way back:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In Nagoya, it was partly cloudy.  This was at 11:00am.  The sky wasn't a pure blue, but there were breaks that let the sun shine through.  As I got out of the main urban sprawl of Nagoya into Ichinomiya, I was traveling directly north, and pointed towards a storm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Those road signs above mention that at Seki <span class='ja'>関</span> and Minokamo <span class='ja'>美濃加茂</span>, there are safety checks to ensure drivers are properly applying and using chains on their tires.  It was still totally clear.</p><p>I crossed prefectural lines into Gifu-ken <span class='ja'>岐阜県</span>.

I was still south enough where the ground was warm.</p><p>As I continued, the houses began showing snow collecting on the roofs.  I reached Minokamo, and all traffic was diverted into the rest area.  Traffic officials were present to check cars for winter tires and chains, and help anyone putting chains on their tires.  After returning to the Express Way, snow began to collect on the ground.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The roads were still totally safe.  They were treated enough to melt the snow on contract and keep the traffic moving at a brisk pace.</p><p>I passed through Gujo Hachiman, and then reached Gujo Yamato.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9317_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Snow was definitely beginning to pile along the sides of the roads.

Gujo City's area continues to Hiragano Kogen, and Shokawa is when you finally reach the Hida Area, and Takayama City.</p><p>Once you pass Shirotori, the two-lane express way turns into a single lane.

Travel is pretty slick, but not completely intraversable.  The snow packs and creates enough friction to turn and stop.  Plus, my kei-car naturally drags, so I can slow down fast enough if I need to.</p><p>Once past Shokawa, though, the snow starts to let up a little bit, and the accumulation on the road isn't as great.  Takayama has quite a bit of snow, but it's not too bad.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9349_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Within the city proper, it's pretty close to 0 degrees, so the snow is easy to shovel and move away.  The roads are mostly clear of snow, too.  I arrived home around 1:00pm.</p><p>It's pretty crazy to think that a mere 2 hours away down south, it was probably still sunny, and completely free of any precipitation.  If this were a drive from Madison to Chicago, the weather would be almost identical.  Living in the mountains is amazing.  We're in our own little winter wonder world up here away from the rest of civilization. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Snowcapped Norikura" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/norikura-snow">The Snowcapped Norikura</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I say, "technically," because it was really more like rain that froze into ice and hail before it hit the ground and then immediately melted.  I was outside playing tag with the 2nd graders at the time, too.  It was certainly not snow.  After lunch, the hail started picking up a little bit, but nothing stayed solid on the ground for more than a second or two.  Other more remote, and colder regions of Takayama experienced actual snow.  But, in similar fashion, it almost immediately melted as it reached the ground.  </p><p>Though, for the more highborn mountainous unpopulated areas of Takayama, this was another day of November snow to begin the winter season.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When driving home on Sunday, I took a right turn and standing before me was a scene that looked like a painting in some guy's hunting lodge.  The white capped peaks of Mt. Norikura.  For the past few weeks, there hasn't been a lot of sun.  It has rained several times in Takayama.  But whenever there's rain down here, there's snow all the way up there.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4249.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4249.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4249_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4249_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4249_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4213_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4213_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4213_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4213_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4213_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was on Sunday.</p><p>2 weeks prior, I was at the Norikura Sports Complex for Kendo related events.  When we arrived at the complex, the digital sign on the side of the building proudly declared it was 0 degrees outside.  (0 Celsius)  It didn't really feel all that cold outside, either.</p><p>Throughout the day, the temperature did not rise as I figured it would.  Slowly and surely the cold began to set in, and things were no longer as comfortable as I figured they would be.  Inside the building, the air system turned on, and began pumping heat through the vents.  We looked outside for a quick peak, and it was very lightly snowing. :)  This was the actual first snow I saw for this season.</p><p>The next day, when driving back to town from Kiyomi, it had indeed snowed much more than what I saw up there.

| October 28, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building is a tall distant building just west of Shinjuku station in Shinjuku's skyscraper district.  Within this building are all the government offices which run all the affairs within the Tokyo district <span class='ja'>東京都</span>, which includes all the small towns and cities outside of the metropolis, too.  This "building" is split into 2 separate large buildings, building number 1 and building number 2, and the assembly building, too.</p><p>Building No. 1 is the more prominent and the taller of the two.  It's also the one mostly featured in the following photos.  It has 48 floors, 3 of which are under ground.  At floor 33, the building separates into 2 separate towers, which gives it its distinct look.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_1059_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Within Metro Building No. 1 on Floor 45 of both towers is an observation deck.  It's one of the semi-lesser known sightseeing locations in Tokyo.  Most people are concerned with Tokyo Skytree, or Tokyo Tower.  Unlike those locations, the observation decks on both towers are completely FREE to anyone, and it's open most days out of the year.  Building No. 1 was actually the tallest building in Tokyo, at 243 meters until 2006.  Floor 45 is at 202 meters.</p><p>Dirk, Zach and I visited the building on a Sunday, so there were almost no people around the building.  There were some tourists, but it was mostly vacant.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0743_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When entering the Metro Building square, the assembly building looks like a command ship, and it's main assembly room watches over everything that happens in the area.  It's offices form arms that reach out and surround the entire area, hugging it, and watching over it.  It's an odd feeling.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0769_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0750_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I love the architecture of this place.  If the surrounding building didn't create enough claustrophobia, Metro Building No. 1 shoots straight into the sky, and peers back down at you.</p><p>We went inside and had our choice between visiting the North or South tower first.  We chose the North for some reason.  After going through some light security, we were whisked directly to the top floor by special elevator.  We arrived, and were given a great view of the city.</p><p>Here is the view further west.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0843_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141019_metrobuilding/IMG_0853_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The weather was very nice and clear.  It was not clear enough to see Mt. Fuji, though, unfortunately.  I think the map said it would appear above that large soccer field near where the two photos meet.  I'll try to visit Skytree in December when the air tends to be more clear, and see if I can get a photo.</p><p>Tokyo is such an urban sprawl.

At this point, it feels more like a relic of Japan's industrial-ness and commercial prowess from a different time and place.  Things change, and the Tokyo Tower still stands to remind us of the past, in the shadow of the present.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9942_stitch.webp" /></p><p>It's construction finished in 1958, more than 55 years ago.  It was originally built as a antenna to broadcast television and radio signals throughout the metropolis.  It's height ensured the signal would travel far enough to the households of Tokyo, and prevent the unnecessary construction of many shorter towers.</p><p>The architect, Tachu Naito, chose the Eiffel Tower as the design because it's structural sound design could withstand massive earthquakes, and torrential Typhoon winds.  He improved the design slightly increases the height 30 meters above the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>Unfortunately, with the conversation to digital television, Tokyo Tower was too short to completely cover the Tokyo area with the digital signal.  Plans for Tokyo Skytree began in 2008, and was complete in 2012, which made the Tokyo Tower just a little less special.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9959_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9959_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9959_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9959_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_9959_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I first visited Tokyo Tower 5 years ago, and wrote my experience at that time: <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower" title="/tokyo-tower">June 1st, 2009</a>.  I wanted to visit Tokyo Tower again because it was the symbol of Tokyo for quite a while, and is definitely the most recognizable location I first learned about Tokyo.

Lots of Turkish tourists for whatever reason.  Plenty of westerners, and several other asian foreigns.  Very few Japanese tourists came here.  I think the nation is more obsessed with Skytree, at the moment.</p><p>The size difference between the main and special observatories is quite clear.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0184.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0184.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0184_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0184_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0184_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0198.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0198.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0198_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0198_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0198_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The main observatory deck had a good view, but no where near the same as the special deck.  The special deck was very tiny, and really only offered the view.

Unless something interesting happens to the tower, or there's some special event, I probably won't come back here for quite some time.  Actually!  Maybe I'll return here at night, or at sunset.  I have too many day photos of the tower.</p><p>But today, I was satisfied with my visit.  I bought omiyage for my fellow teachers from the gift shop, and left the tower.  On the way back to the station, I went to that park with the good view, and took my photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0231.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141018_tokyotower/IMG_0231_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Yeah, maybe next time I'm in Tokyo, I'll try to return around 5pm as the sunsets.
