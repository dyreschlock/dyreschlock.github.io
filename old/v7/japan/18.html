In most crisis Japan has faced, the Yakuza have been a key organizing in establishing peace and protection of citizens.  This article is quite informative on Yakuza in Japan, a little bit of history, and the history of their aid during crisis.<br/><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/dailybeast/20110318/ts_dailybeast/12990_japaneseyakuzaaidearthquakereliefefforts_1" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/dailybeast/20110318/ts_dailybeast/12990_japaneseyakuzaaidearthquakereliefefforts_1" title="http://news.yahoo.com/s/dailybeast/20110318/ts_dailybeast/12990_japaneseyakuzaaidearthquakereliefefforts_1">http://news.yahoo.com/s/dailybeast/20110318/ts_dailybeast/12990_japaneseyakuzaaidearthquakereliefefforts_1</a> (via <a href="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88143.php" title="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88143.php" title="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88143.php">News on Japan</a>)</p><p>That article has several interesting tidbits, including this quote from a member of the Yamaguchi-gumi,  "Please don't say any more than we are doing our best to help. Right now, no one wants to be associated with us and we'd hate to have our donations rejected out of hand."  And this one, "There are no yakuza or katagi (ordinary citizens) or gaijin (foreigners) in Japan right now. We are all Japanese.

Many buildings have cut off all non-essential power and the extremely bright city is now dimmed.  The streets that are usually overwhelmed with people are now empty.  Everyone is at home indoors.  Most businesses aren't operating because of the power loss, so people don't have much to do.  A friend of mine lives in Tokyo, and he's says that he's pretty much bored.  There's not much to do when work is canceled and the power is out.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita Airport</b></div><p>As I mentioned before, I had a trip to Japan all figured out before the earthquake happened.  I was set to leave next Thursday March 24th.  I was flying out on United and they've granted anyone with tickets before March 31st a chance to rebook their flight for free (<a href="http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6867,52939,00.html" title="http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6867,52939,00.html" title="http://www.united.com/page/article/0,6867,52939,00.html">link</a>).  So, I'm in the process of doing that now.  My trip will be postponed to May or June sometime.</p><p>I'm not really worried about the danger so much, but I would be one more person in the way and using up resources in a city where most foreign countries have asked their citizens to evacuate.  Narita is being over run by people fleeing the country right now.  I read an article that says all the hotels nearby are completely full.  And most people are showing up to Narita without any tickets buying the first flight they can out of there.  Some tickets are selling for $3000, and many airlines have been sending extra flights to accomodate the mass exodus.</p><p>Also, Most trains and busses are packed with people fleeing the city.  So, heading out to Tokyo is definitely a bad decision at this time.</p><div class='title'><b>Youtube</b></div><p>A few more videos have popped up on youtube that have caught my eye.</p><p>Here's a childrens video describing the situation at the Fukushima reactor.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aH2-MhEko" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aH2-MhEko" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aH2-MhEko">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1aH2-MhEko</a></p><p>CBS posted a video of the Tsunami water pouring into a town right on the ocean.  This video really shows how powerful the waves are.  Houses are being uprooted, and building torn down.  What I find disturbing is that the cameraman pans to the right and shows a person on a nearby building.  He pans back to the left when the water really starts moving.  A minute later he pans back to the right and that building is COMPLETELY gone!  Along with that person :(<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikus_TEaGI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikus_TEaGI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikus_TEaGI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ikus_TEaGI</a></p><p>Another sad video that is getting a lot of attention is about those two dogs.  One dog stands by another wounded dog.  Many people view this as a symbol of how Japan continues to endour this disaster.<br/><a href="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88104.php" title="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88104.php" title="http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88104.php">http://newsonjapan.com/html/newsdesk/article/88104.php</a></p><div class='title'><b>The Onion</b></div><p class='img'>The Onion had a few things to say referencing the disaster in Japan.<br/><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/BrookeAlvarez/status/48035078793728000" title="http://twitter.com/#!/BrookeAlvarez/status/48035078793728000" title="http://twitter.com/#!/BrookeAlvarez/status/48035078793728000"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110316_japan/onion.webp"></a></p><p>Nuclear Energy Advocates Insist U.S. Reactors Completely Safe Unless Something Bad Happens<br/><a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/nuclear-energy-advocates-insist-us-reactors-comple,19740/" title="http://www.theonion.com/articles/nuclear-energy-advocates-insist-us-reactors-comple,19740/" title="http://www.theonion.com/articles/nuclear-energy-advocates-insist-us-reactors-comple,19740/">http://www.theonion.com/articles/nuclear-energy-advocates-insist-us-reactors-comple,19740/</a></p><div class='title'><b>Donate!</b></div><p>Once again, Donate if you can.<br/><a href="http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html" title="http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html" title="http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html">http://www.google.com/crisisresponse/japanquake2011.html</a><br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Crisis in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/crisis-in-japan">Crisis in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 16, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Over the last week, Japan has been slammed with crisis.  They were rocked with a 9.0 earthquake, followed by the resulting Tsunami, and currently trying to prevent a Nuclear meltdown from the damaged incurred by the earthquake and tsunami.  I wanted to write something up real quick that a lot of links to video, photos, and other information about what's going on over there.</p><p>I've been keeping a close eye on everything as Japan is quite special to me.  I have several friends living there, and I'm concerned about them.  Also, because my brother and I had a vacation scheduled from March 24th through April 5th, and I was wondering how feasible it would be to continue with those plans.

I don't really know all the details on how a nuclear power plant works, and what they've been doing to contain it.  Reddit user dwolf12345 posted an AMA since he's a reactor operator at a US plant very similar to Fukushima<br/><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/" title="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/" title="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/">http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/g45ib/iama_reactor_operator_at_a_boiling_water_reactor/</a></p><p><em>"The fission reaction stops nearly instantly, however while the core is at power all the material in the core becomes INCREDIBLY radioactive. So after the fission reaction stops there is still considerable heat being generated due to radioactive decay of the fuel and other activated core components (this is called decay heat).</p><p>This is the heat that is causing the issues in Japan. It can take a day or two to cool the core down to below the boiling point even with good decay heat removal systems. As long as the vessel is kept full and the temperature brought down slowly and deliberately there is no issue at all. But take away that cooling system and the water it provides and you've got problems."</em></p><p><em>"It is very bad. No hyperbole there...nuclear plants NEED electrical power, even when shut down to ensure that the fuel stays cool. These plants were blacked out (no AC power) for 2-3 days. Normally losing off-site power is recoverable because of the on-site emergency diesel generators, however in this case they were swamped. In all likelihood they went without AC and DC power for a very long time. This means that any actions taken to stabilize the plant had to be manual(since there was no control power for remote controlling stations). They have gone deep down in their emergency plans, probably (although I am not sure of this) into their Severe Accident Management Guidelines. This means that they are beyond their design basis. Sort of into unknown territory, which is frightening to me.</p><div class='title'><b>If they are injecting seawater that means that they are no longer concerned with recovering these reactors.</b> It means that they have fallen back to "protect the public" mode. So far from what I have read, there is very likely fuel melt, but the reactor vessels and the primary containments are still intact. The hydrogen explosions occurred in their secondary containments due to build-up of vented steam/gasses from the primary containments or reactor vessels. Not sure if this is a design difference or due to the deranged equipment, our plant would vent the gas outside of both containments. <b>One thing is for sure, hydrogen almost surely means melted cladding and fuel damage.</b></div><p>Now I hear there is a fire on site and it may be threatening the spent fuel pool of one unit. This worries me more than the other issues right now. Spent fuel on the pool is within the secondary containment, but outside the primary containment. Needless to say it is HIGHLY radioactive. Assuming the primary containments hold at all the facilities, then the fuel pool is much more vulnerable and dangerous.</p><p>Keep in mind, these guys are in new territory here. They may have drilled and trained for these scenarios, but nothing ever goes exactly according to plan. I have much respect for the guys who are there and fighting this beast."</em></p><p><em>"<b>First off this cannot be like Chernobyl as they are very different animals.</b> Chernobyl actively exploded the reactor vessel. Chernobyl had no primary containment (by design), only a secondary containment structure. So when it blew the vessel head off, it and the steam plume blasted the building apart. Chernobyl fuel was open to the sky, no barrier at all between the public and the molten core of the reactor. That is why it spewed millions of curies of radioactive particulate into the sky.</p><p>There is a threat with the spent fuel pools. I don't know how much fuel they have in their pools, if any. If they do it is just as hazardous as what is in the core, with one exception. It is outside the primary containment structure. This makes it a little more worrisome in my opinion. I haven't heard much mention of the spent fuel pools at any of the affected units. I hope that is because everything there is under control. They do not require much cooling, because most of it has been removed from a core for a long time and has had many half-lives to decay away, so there is little decay heat. However, it is still quite radioactive.</p><p>The containment at Daiichi is much different than Chernobyl. Assuming that the fuel melted in all three of the affected reactors then there is still a very robust reactor vessel and a even more robust primary containment structure. Both are designed to be flood-able, and we know that they are filling up with borated seawater. </p><p>The name of the game now is cover and cool. This is what they are doing. I think there will be and has been release of radioactive materials, but so far they are keeping those cards close to the vest. I think in time it will be revealed to be orders of magnitude less than Chernobyl.</p><p>There is some news that Daiichi 2 has had a breach in the reactor vessel. That means that there is in all likelihood some fuel material out of the vessel and in the primary containment structure. Not time to panic yet, just need them to keep cooling that containment."</em></p><p><em>"Worst case...all the threatened containments fail and/or the fuel pools drain/collapse. The amount of radioactive material released is huge and we get an Asian version of Pripyat.</p><p>The reactors are shutdown now and they are getting water into the vessels (borated seawater). So, we are dealing with decay heat and it is not likely there will be a massive explosion a la Chernobyl, but the release could still be huge."</em></p><p>The Wikipedia entry for the Fukushima disaster is being updated constantly.  Here's the article on the timeline of events: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Fukushima_nuclear_accidents" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Fukushima_nuclear_accidents" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Fukushima_nuclear_accidents">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Fukushima_nuclear_accidents</a></p><p>That also shows that NISA rates this as a Level 4 nuclear disaster, whereas ASN rates it as Level 6.Â Here's the International Nuclear Event Scale explaining those levels: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Nuclear_Event_Scale</a></p><p>Also, in you're wondering, they are about 15 nuclear power sites across Japan housing 55 nuclear reactors.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Japan" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Japan" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Japan">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_in_Japan</a></p><p>Several of the northeastern plants have been shut down automatically from the tremors.  As such, Japan is operating under a huge power loss.  They have dimmed down electricty in Tokyo is conserve as much power as possible.  They have also roaming scheduled blackouts to keep the electrical output needed at a minimum.</p><p>Eva Geeks comments that there's a grassroots movement of nerds to dub these blackouts and brownouts after an event that happens in the Evangelion television show and movies, entitled Operation Yashima.

| December 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Over the past 3-4 years gaming has changed considerably.  In 2005, the Xbox 360 was released, and then in 2006, the Playstation 3 and Wii were released.  Obviously, we're in a new era of gaming with which consoles are on the market, but the considerable change has been the paradigm shift from Japan's dominance in game development to Western.  And by Western, I mean Europe and North America, the "western" civilizations.</p><p>From Nintendo's "splash" in America in 1985 with <b>Super Mario Bros.</b>, and later with <b>Legend of Zelda</b>, and <b>Metroid</b> and Sega's <b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b>, Western development had been behind the curve.  Maybe because we never really thought of gaming as a mature medium.  Most western games were lower quality copies of their Japanese counterparts, while Nintendo and Sega were iterating on their ideas.  Capcom created <b>Mega Man</b> and <b>Street Fighter</b>, Konami created <b>Castlevania</b>.</p><p>There were definitely a couple games that were born in Western game development that established genres as well.  ID created <b>Wolfenstein </b>and <b>Doom</b>, Westwood created <b>Command &amp; Conquer</b>, and Blizzard created <b>Warcraft</b>.  But these First Person Shooters and Real Team Strategy games were absolutely foreign to Japan.  There is something distinct and exclusive to Japanese culture that I'm not sure anyone has ever defined.  If something foreign does not resonate with these ideals it will not be adopted.</p><p>Japan is also incredibly nationalistic and narcisistic at times.  It's only natural that when they're on their game, they become full of themselves.  I'm sure this is where the term <b>Youge</b> originated its discriminatory meaning.</p><div class='title'><b>Youge</b></div><p>Youge literally translates as Western Game.  "You-" (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>洋</span></span>) is the prefix for Western things, and Ge is short for Geemu (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ゲーム</span></span>) or Game.  It's discriminatory double meaning has been born out of their dominance and disregard for Western game development.</p><p>From their 20 year dominance over game development, Western Games have been seen as second class in Japan.  32-bit era games and last-gen games like <b>Metal Gear Solid</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time</b>, <b>ICO</b>, <b>Shadow of the Collosus</b>, <b>Okami</b>, <b>Final Fantasy VII </b>and <b>Final Fantasy X </b>did things with story and gameplay that truly brought maturity to gaming.</p><p>For me, everyone of those games I've gotten emotionally attached to.  I cared for the characters and story.  There wasn't any game that came from the Western side of things that made me feel anything beyond the normal enjoyment of the game.</p><p>But that began changing with the Xbox.  Western developers now had a video game platform outside of the PC, and began taking some of Japan's ideas as their own.  Games like <b>Grand Theft Auto 3</b>, <b>Halo</b>, <b>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</b>, and <b>Prince of Persia Sand of Time </b>were mature products that had mass appeal but were uniquely Western.</p><p>In today's era, there have been an incredibly few Japanese games that have done anything interesting. <b> Dead Rising</b>, <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess </b>and <b>Super Mario Galaxy </b>are just about it.  They stand along-side far more Western games such as <b>Halo 3</b>, <b>Mass Effect</b>, <b>Oblivion</b>, <b>Bioshock</b>, <b>Grand Theft Auto 4</b>, <b>Dead Space</b>, <b>Fallout 3</b>, <b>Batman Arkham Asylum</b>, and <b>Dragon Age</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japan needs to get over it</b></div><p>Kotaku had an article this morning translating Youichi Wada's (CEO of Square Enix) news report about their upcoming release of <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b> and the recent worldwide release of <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> (<a href="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory" title="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory" title="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory">here</a>).  He says that Japan needs to get over this discriminatory meaning.  Western games are truly leading the world, and Japan has got to face facts and recognize their success.</p><p>Wada isn't the only one.  Keiji Inafune said the exact same thing during Tokyo Game Show this year, exclaiming, <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/">Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished.</a>"  Evolve or die.</p><p>Final Fantasy XIII will definitely be a test for Japan.  Will a game that pure Japanese have the worldwide appeal that it's had in the past?  Will XIII inspire game development the way VII and X have before?  I really wonder if I'll enjoy it having given up on Japanese RPGs.</p><p>I think the only other games worth mentioning on Japan's horizon are <b>The Last Guardian </b>and <b>Legend of Zelda Wii</b>.  Everything else is just an unoriginal copy-cat.</p><div class='title'><b>The Rise and Fall of Japan</b></div><p>Also, 1up has an amazing article from Sept 2008 about <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938" title="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938" title="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938">The Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Japan</a> that explains all this far better than I attempted.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, The Japanese have a word for it!</b></div></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Goroawase 語呂合わせ" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/goroawase">Goroawase 語呂合わせ</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 7, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><p>Yesterday, at work, I was talking with one of the project managers about the Konami Code.  We have <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/" title="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/" title="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/">Flex Spy</a> setup in our Flex App, but we only want Users logged into the omni-user account to use it, and even then, we don't want it displayed at inappropriate times.  Why not implement the Konami Code?  When an omni-user keys in the code while using our app, it'll appear!</p><p>I think everyone in my age group knows what the Konami Code is, but might not necessarily know it by name.  This code showed up in almost all of Konami's arcade style games starting with the NES in the late 80s up through today.  The Konami Code is as follows...</p><p>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Select, Start.</p><p>I sent the project manager a link to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Wikipedia Page</a>.  After glancing over the article real quick, I noticed a little piece of information that solved a mystery that sat around in my head for years and years.</p><p><em>In Mobile phone games by Konami, B A are substituted with 5 7 3 on the numerical pad, which is the goroawase pronunciation for "konami."</em></p><p>573!  I have seen that number all over the place in Konami games.  I first noticed this when I saw that every single Konami Arcade game has a default high score of 57300.  I had no idea why that was significant, but it was consistent.</p><div class='title'><b>Goroawase</b></div><p>Goroawase uses the native Japanese reading (kun'yomi), the Japanese approximation of Chinese reading (on'yomi), and the English reading to describe a word in the form of a number.  The Wiki page has a wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">chart</a> showing each reading for each number.</p><p>The normal reading of 573 in Japanese is "go-shichi-san".  For 7 and 3, we want to use the native Japanese pronunciation, so it would be "go-nana-mitsu".  If we use the base kana for "go", and just the first syllables of 7 and 3, we get "ko-na-mi".</p><p>This is used in various places throughout gaming.  In Dance Dance Revolution, there's a Song called ".59".  In Japanese, the period is pronounced 'ten'.  So with that, the reading would be "Ten-go-ku", which translates as "Heaven" in English.  You might also know Japanese Video Game Designer, Suda Goichi, who writes his name Suda 51.  His name gets mispronounced all the time in the states as Suda Fifty-One.</p><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">Wiki Article</a> has a couple more examples that are interesting ^_^<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost in Translation" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-in-translation">Lost in Translation</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>I'm sure I've seen Lost in Translation before today.  Lost in Translation is a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  It's about two people who aren't very happy, and then are subjected to culture shock to make it worse.  Through their culture shock and depression they meet each other. And bring each other out of it.</p><p>I could've sworn I've seen it before, but despite taking place in Japan and starring Bill Murray, it didn't make an impression on me.  Though in October 2003, I was in a different place.  Happy and in love.  Lost in Translation's heavy tones fell on my deaf ears.</p><div class='title'><b>Isolation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp"  /></p><p>When I find myself alone in Japan, there is always that looming sense of isolation.  I can ask questions and receive answers, but there is no one I can really engage in conversation.  All I have are my thoughts to bounce ideas off of.  I text, email or IM people back home, but the sound of my own voice becomes mute.  It becomes a treasure when I actually have another American (like myself) to talk to.  I thought Scarlett Johansson nailed that emotion perfectly when the film followed her around for a day.</p><p>Those scenes really are the perfect picture of a lone foreigner wandering about the daily lives of a population that is not their own.  For the most part, everyone just ignores the outsider.  Everyone is plugged into their lives, and have no business getting into others.  Children will sometimes break those boundaries, but that's only because they haven't been incorporated into society, yet.</p><p>Though, I've never experienced the agoraphobic culture shock to the point of incapacitation.  The only times it has taken anchor has been when I've truly been alone in Japan.  But, I just throw those emotions away.  My time in Japan has always been short and limited.  It would be a waste to be stuck in a tiny hotel room.</p><div class='title'><b>Language</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp"  /></p><p>Obviously, I identify far more with Scarlett Johansson's character's silent brooding wonderment, than Bill Murray's case.  Though when I'm in Japan, it's for absolutely no purpose than to wander around and look at things.  If I were there on business, as is Bill Murray's character, my culture shock probably wouldn't be as agoraphobic.  His culture shock is in the language and miss-communication.  I don't have much trouble in that department.</p><p>The scene where Bill Murray is waiting in the hospital talking with the granny is a conversation I've had many times in Japan. ^_^  Japanese people will always try to dumb down their language to what they think is simple for you, but is often what makes them even more difficult to understand.  I know sentence structure, noun forms, and what is being said, I just can't translate some of the words because my vocabulary is horrible.  Maybe I just need to ask, "What is this word?"</p><p>Though, a lot of the Japanese dialogue in the film is pretty easy to understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Moments</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp"  /></p><p>Lost in Translation ends in the same manor many moments end in Japan.  A moment is that is truly final.  A moment that can only take place in a single moment of your life and one that can never be relived.  A "Goodbye" that is goodbye forever.</p><p>Charolette and Bob Harris depart under these terms and embrace with the knowledge they will never see each other again.  Because time in Japan always comes with an expiration date.  And when it expires, that is it.  The end.  And that is where the film ends.</p><div class='title'><b>Epilogue, aka Reverse Culture Shock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp"  /></p><p>In real life, most of these moments are final, but that is not the end of the story.  The epilogue is returning to life before Japan.  Taken away from isolation and plugged back in familiarity and understanding.  For some people this is a breath of fresh air.  People to finally talk to!  People who understand me!  For me, I cherish the isolation.</p><p>Nothing bothers me in Japan.  People keep to themselves and are polite to each other.  Store clerks say thank you and go out of their way to ensure your satisfaction.  Being a foreigner, I'm a guest in their country and they treat me as such.</p><p>Back in America, Life sucks.  Everyone is unhappy because they HAVE to work today.  A single customer asking a single request is WAY TOO GODDAMN much of a hassle.  People think too much of themselves rather than the company they represent.  They think of the company paying them for their services, rather than them earning their pay for giving their services.</p><p>Everything in life returns to the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary.  Here's what I thought when I first got back after those 3.5 months studying abroad: <a href="/old/v7/home" title="/home" title="/home">December 29th, 2006</a>.</p><p>Showing this side of being in Japan would have truly ruined Lost in Translation.</p><div class='title'><b>Passion!</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost in Translation fell on deaf ears because I didn't know anything about this.  I never had these moments.  I never experienced such isolation.  I never had to talk through a language barrier.  All these points resonate beautifully in the film.  So much so that I can never watch it again.  Unless it's with my friends from the Fall 2006 Class of Nagasaki Gaigokugo Daigaku.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tokyo Tower" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower">Tokyo Tower</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm totally excited, but the day's traveling has worn that down a little bit.  It's not until my batteries are fully recharged that my energy empowers my excitement.  That first morning back in Japan is like Christmas as a Child.</p><p>I want to do everything!  And my first destination was Tokyo Tower, which is its own symbol of regeneration.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp"  /></p><p>After World War II, Japan was a defeated nation.  They were down, but not out.  Everyone in the nation pulled together to rebuild Japan.  Japan flourished once again.</p><p>In 1953, NHK began broadcasting for the first time.  But the signal was too weak for the entire Kanto region to receive its signals.  It was clear that a large transmission tower would be needed to boost the signal, or else moderately sized ones would choke Tokyo.</p><p>They called upon Tachu Naito to architect such a tower.  He chose the France's Eiffel Tower as a starting point, and designed a structure so secure that it could withstand an Earthquake twice the strength of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake (8.3 on the Richter Scale) and typhoons with wind speeds up to 140 miles an hour.</p><p>When completed it stood 30 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower.  It became a symbol for Japan.  A monument to their efforts to rebuild Japan and their growing economic power.</p><p>Thank you, Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp"  /></p><p>Tokyo Tower has 2 observatory decks.

selling a lot of my collectibles because I really haven't gotten anything out them.  I bought a whole lot of figures from McFarlane toys, and they've done nothing but sit in my parent's attic for nearly 10 years.  So, I put them on ebay.  Some of them sold quite fast, but others lingered for quite a long time.</p><p>Fast forward to March this year.  I've already purchased airfare for the first couple days in May to visit Tokyo, Japan.  I get an email from an ebay user wondering if I'd ship something of mine to Tokyo.  The light bulb immediately flashes in my head, and I start writing the reply,</p><p>"Yeah, I could ship to Tokyo but it'll be about $30 or $40 extra.  As it so happens, I'll be in Tokyo at the beginning of May.  If you wouldn't mind waiting 2 months, I could deliver the figure in person free of charge. ^_^  What do you say?"</p><p>Initially, the user was taken back by this.  "What?  I don't even know you," his first reply began with.  But once I proved the depths of my Anime nerdom, he agreed to meet.  He introduced himself as Akira. ^_^  I asked him for suggestions of places I should visit while in Japan and he mentioned to Ghibli Museum.  There's a Ghibli Museum?!  Damn straight I'm going there.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning a trip to the Ghibli Museum</b></div><p>Thankfully, Akira mentioned that buying tickets for the Ghibli Museum is not straightforward.  You can't buy the tickets at the Museum.  In Japan, you must buy tickets at a Lawsons convenience store.  The ticket is for a specific day with entrance at a specific time of that day.  For non-Japanese residents, you must buy your tickets through JTB Travel Agency.</p><p>We choose a day, May 3rd, and bought our tickets without a problem.  Our tickets were for 2pm, so we planned to meet up ahead of time.  We could go to Shinjuku or wherever and hang out.  Eventually, we'll make our way down to Mitaka Station and take the bus to the Ghibli Museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Hanging Out before hand</b></div><p>Thank god for my Japanese Cell Phone.  There's no way we would've found each other had he not been able to call me and talk.  We met in near the East entrance of Shinjuku Station.  And we just walked around to various stores and arcades in the area,  chatted about Anime and Games.  What I liked, What he liked.  General bullshit like that.</p><p>We hopped on a train and went over to Nakano to visit the very first Mandarake store.  The Nakano Mandarake was absolutely massive.  It was 3 floors with each floor was about the size of a mall.  This Mandarake was segmented into many different stores that specialized in each tiny niche of otaku fandom.</p><p class='img'><img

game, one for new games, artbooks, design books, animation cells, figures, statues, gashapon, old music, game music, foreign music, anime, movies, foreign movies...  the list goes on and on.  This is where I found Ikaruga Used for $36.  I also found a few <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp"

Mandarake is also where I found more Super Mario Bros. sound drops.</p><p>As time crept closer to 2pm, we left Mandarake, hopped on a train and headed for Mitaka.  We got to the Museum right on time and met up with Akira's wife, Natsuki, outside. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Museum</b></div><p class='img'><img

heavily wooded park, the organic domes and vine covered walls made a perfect home.</p><p class='img'><img

the museum was very nice.  Each part of the museum was a separate room that you'd enter from the center of the building.  The first room had animated statues of Ghilbi characters that displayed how the animation process works.</p><p>Also on the first floor, was a theater that played an original production only available to see at the Museum.  They have 6 or 7 different original 15-minute films that rotate month after month.  For May, they were playing "Mei to Koneko Bus" (english: "Mei and the Koneko Bus").  Which featured Mei from Totoro who captured a Kitty Bus, and then go off in the woods with it and meets a bunch of Totoros.  It was really cute. ^_^</p><p>After the film, we went on the roof to see the Laputa Garden.  When reaching the roof, you're immediately greeted by a Laputa Giant.  Akira and I stood next to it for a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp"

Cat Bus for the kids to hop around on.  There was also an area that served as a replica to Miyazaki's workbench from when he began Ghibli films.  All along the walls were original sketches and storyboards for his works throughout the years.</p><p>There was the gift shop too!  I bought a design book that has many storyboards from Ghibli films throughout the years.  I bought some stickers for my suitcase.  And, I bought some other things to give as gifts for people. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Afterwards..</b></div><p>After leaving the Ghibli Museum, we walked through the park towards the Kichijoji train station.  Mitaka is a beatiful area.  Perfect for letting children run around outside in a nice wooded area, rather than the cool concrete of the Tokyo streets.  Before we parted ways, we went to Dinner at a Sushi restaurant underneath Kichijoji station.</p><p class='img'><img

through the restaurant.  When something came by your table that looked delicious you'd take it from the line and it's yours!  The color and design of the plate designated the price you'd pay for eating it.  Prices ranged from 75 cents a plate to $6.  My favorite sushi were in the $1.50, $2 range, so I was fine. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img

crisp and cool, next to the tender soft crab meat wrapped around delicious rice topped with some mayonaise and tuna eggs.  (at least, I think those are tuna eggs.)</p><p>Delicious!  But I still prefer 100 yen Sushi in Nagasaki. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Bon Voyage..</b></div><p>Meeting Akira and Natsuki was amazing and definitely the highlight of my trip.  The Language difference wasn't too great.  They were much better at English than I was at Japanese.  But we were able to go back and forth between the 2 to figure out what we were trying to say.  Hopefully, my Japanese will be better next time I'm in Tokyo so we can have better conversations!</p><p>If you buy or sell stuff on ebay, I think it's definitely worth your while to meet up with people if you have the chance.  Whatever you're buying or selling is a great place to start a conversation.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/19">« Previous Entries</a></div><div
