You can make it."</p><p>"I wager that i can..  here i go.."</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04158.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04158.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04158.webp" /></p><p>"ha ha...  ow, my feat kinda hurt."</p><p>"heh, good job.  here's that promised dollar.  Good luck spending it here."<br/>____</p><p>Anyways, the other day some girls were going around trying to get people to sign up for Dance club.  On friday, they held their first meeting in a class room and showed up two dances: One for boys and one for girls.  The boy's dance is called Soran.  It's the dance of the fisherman.  I told people that if they signed up for it, i'd do the same.</p><p>Practice has a rather intensive schedule though.  Every Mon, Wed, and Fri at 4:30pm to 6:00pm we must practice for the upcoming festivel in November.  Yeeshh..  that doesn't give me a whole lot of time to do anything else.</p><p>So, Monday rolled around.  Kyle and I went to the destined practicing place in front of the gym.  Around 4:45pm, the girl's showed up to start the practice.  We did stretches and they began to show how to do the Soran dance.  It's actually rather easy.  Just a few simple dance moves, combine, and you're got the beginning of the Soran dance.</p><p>So..  it was the 4 japanese girls leading us, 5 or 6 chinese girls learning the dance, then there's Kyle, myself, Morgan and Kevin learning the dance as well.  Right in front of the gym.. in front of everyone waiting for the bus. ^_^</p><p>We eventually took a break after an hour and began talking about things.  The same questions are always asked.  "Where are you from?", "What's your major?", "How old are you..?"  I said how old i was and they asked if i were married <_<</p><p>We asked them if they were any good at DDR.  Ya know..  chances are they've probably played it before.  Natsuko said she was pretty good at it..  oh really?  So we asked them to go to Taito with us after dance practice to challenge them.  muahaha.</p><p>We stopped off at McDonalds first because people were hungry, and the 1st floor of Taito is a McDonalds.  I finally had my chance to order the infamous Shrimp burger.  I'm not really sure if the shrimp burger actually exists.  I ordered what i thought was the shrimp burger, but it was actually a Shrimp Filet sandwich, much like a Fish Filet sandwich.  It was rather tasty, but definately not a burger.  Man... I could really go for a burger.</p><p>Anywho..  after eating good 'ol american food, we went upstairs to catch out the 'ol DDR machine.  Kyle and I got up on the machine and blew them away ^_^.  Those girls were laughing and cheering.  Wheee..  Unfortunately, Natsuko didn't play because she was wearing jeans, or something like that.  Maki and Miyu played though..  on Basic.  Morgan and Kevin gave it a go too.  Kevin was actually pretty good. ^_^</p><p>There was this nerdy japanese guy hanging around, trying to capitalize on our cheer squad.  He got up on the machine and played some Des-Row songs.  He started on basic, but then failed he second song on difficult.  Poor little fella.  He reminds me of Densha Otoko.</p><p>Anyways, the night was quite fun ^_^.  Dance club should be a blast.  They invited us for sushi and drinking this weekend too. ^_^</p><p>At the end of the evening, i had a picture taken to comemorate the occasion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061002_dance/DSC04160.webp" /></p><p>DDR can build up quite a sweat.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Japanese Gaming" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/japanese-gaming">Japanese Gaming</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 2, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Since coming to Japan i've purchased a couple games; most of which, i cannot play because i didn't bring that equipment with me.  So far i've purchased..</p><p>XII Stag on Playstation 2 for $5<br/>DDR Extra Mix on Playstation for $18<br/>Rez on Dreamcast for $15<br/>Dragonforce on Saturn for $2<br/>Shining Wisdom on Saturn for $2 (I'm not really sure why anymore...)<br/>Some Kanji game on DS for $35 (oops..)<br/>Rakubiki Jiten on DS for $42<br/>Pokemon Diamond on DS for $42<br/>Chososhu Mecha MG on DS for $18 (after points)</p><p>and probably around $30 on DDR Supernova in the arcade, including the e-Amusement Card.  That kanji game was really the only screw up so far.  I might try to trade it in when i pick up Phoenix Wright II at the end of the month.  I've written a little bit of a review for the Rakubiki Jiten, so here are my thoughts on Pokemon Diamond and Chososhu Mecha MG.<br/>____</p><p>Pokemon Diamond.</p><p>Last Thursday, Pokemon Diamond was released to Japan and sold out sometime on Friday.  When we were walking around on Saturday, a copy of Pokemon Diamond or Pearl was no where in sight.  It's still as popular as it ever was. ^_^  Japan should gets it's second wave of Pokemon Diamond and Pearl this coming Friday, so little kids who missed their chance this past weekend will get another chance to pick it up.</p><p>The language barrier is rather amazing.  Since it's marketed for little kids, Pokemon is all in either hiragana or katakana.  There is no Kanji whatsoever, unless you count the yen kanji.  It's helps me build my reading ability of hiragana and katakana rather well ^_^, though i still don't have the vocabulary to know what's going on.</p><p>Pokemon Diamond plays just like any other Pokemon though, so finding out where to go and what to do is simply a matter of talking to everyone in the town and then venturing forth to places you haven't been yet.  I suppose later on in the game, this will become more of a problem.  Currently though, i've been able to get two badges and defeat Team Rocket twice without getting lost or frustrated because of the language..  It's not like Pokemon has much of a story anyways.  I can read about the new cool Pokemon online somewhere if i want the story.</p><p>Back to the yen, i always wondered what the currency actually was in the game.  When playing Pokemon Emerald, everything was in credits.  100 credits for a Poke-ball, 200 credits for a healing item.  I tried to figure out how much that would be in real-life currency.  Actually, i think about this quite often.  "How much would a Final Fantasy tent cost in real life.."  I mean, you make, like, thousands of dollars in the game.  It's not like the idea of going around killing monsters for a living hasn't crossed my mind before.  Anyways, it's 100 yen for a Pokeball.  That's $1.  What a fricken deal.  I'd buy tons of those, if there was a Poke-mart nearby.  Usually when you beat up some kid in the forest, you win $1 or $2 from him.  That's pretty mean.  It's like stealing milk money from children.  I liked my idea before where 1 poke-credit equalled 1/10 of $1.  Then a pokeball is $10 and a little bit more reasonable considering the amount of technology built in them.</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>The graphical style of Pokemon Diamond is quite impressive.  They have effectively transferred the 2D graphics into a 3D plane without screwing over any of the individual detail you'd find in previous titles.  The 3D plane is evident when you walk around and the foreground actually shifts along with your point of view.  It's a very subtle 3D effect that really looks amazing on the DS.</p><p>In battles the graphical style is alot like Pokemon Emerald, with a little bit more of a watercolor backdrop.  The pokemon still have little animations when they enter, ala Emerald.  This is where the touch screen is actually used.  All the battle commands are presented on the touch screen.  It's like Phoenix Wright, where you can either use the the directional pad and select options, or you can just touch the options to select them.  It's pretty slick.  I can still play pokemon one-handed!!  Whoo hoo...  guess who's driving while playing Pokemon when he returns to the states.</p><p>While walking around, you get a little pokemon gadget that keeps tracks on various data on your second screen.  It can keep track of your steps, the current time, your pokemon HP, and.. on other thing.  It's really helpful to have that info up front, especially the steps if you're trying to hatch eggs.</p><p>Speaking of time, Pokemon Diamond and Pearl use a real-time system, much like Animal Crossing.  When it's night outside, it's night in the game.  When it's day outside, it's day in the game.  My game is a little messed up since my DS is on US time, and i don't really want to change it.</p><p>One thing that i've also liked about Pokemon Diamond is the Pokemon themselves..  They aren't stupid looking, or ugly.  Most of them are ligitimitly cute.  I mean, when you began you have a choice between a leafy turtle, a cute little chilly penguin, or a cute little fire monkey. Awww..  I chose the Chilly Penguin ^_^. The first couple pokemon you face are actually pretty cute too.  There's a cute little bird and a beaver.  I picked up a cute little kitty mouse looking thing near the beginning of the game, which has turned out to be pretty slick too.  I've also been leveling up this Pikachu ripoff.</p><p>So anyways, i've played for about 9 1/2 hours and have beaten two gyms.  I found about 49 pokemon and captured about 29 of 'em.  Well on my way to the new pokemon total of around 500 or something.  I probably won't pick up Diamond or Pearl when they are released in the states, but i'll pick up the remake that combines the two.  Unless, i end up running out of things to play when it comes out.  :shrugs:</p><p>So yeah...  Pokemon Diamond is pretty damn slick, i must say.  It's a great pickup for the DS.<br/>_____</p><p>Chososhu Mecha MG</p><p>I found this game used over at Yamada on Saturday for rather cheap.  $32 is rather cheap for games in Japan.  Plus i had $13 something of store credit there, so i ended up getting it for $19.  Wheee..  that's rather cheap for US standards.</p><p>Mecha MG is basically a mecha game, but it has a rather unique control scheme.  You use the D-pad to move around your mech on the playing field, and then you utilize the touch screen to operate the mech..  Each mech has its own custom console, so you have plenty of different modes and attacks.</p><p>The first mission, you are given a regular 'ol mech that can pick up rocks and move them around.  In the middle of the mission, an enemy mech shows up and you must do away with it.  The console had two controls: a horizontal torso pivot and a vertical pivot.  However, there was a pretty big white-space on the side.  I accidently tapped the empty space, and it began to crack.  So i tapped it alot and it broke away to reveal a button to fire off missiles!  Oh yeah.. ^_^  I tore the hell out of that enemy mecha.</p><p>After the first level, you can move about the world.  It's a pretty linear map and you move about unlocking story points and uncovering missions.  Each mission has 4 difficulties: Easy, Normal, Hard and Superhard, which have an obvious difference.  Defeating a mission will give you some money depending on the difficulty you defeat.  Money can be exchanged for goods and services.</p><p>Though, each level so far has given me a mech to use.  I don't actually own a mech to custom myself..  perhaps i'll get one soon.</p><p>Overall i haven't played it too much, but there is plenty game left.  Since i bought it used, there was some completed data on it at around 38 hours.  I played for about an hour to check it out before getting back to Pokemon.  So far, the game is quite slick is well worth a pickup.  If it doesn't reach the states, i suggest you import it if you can find it for cheap ^_^.<br/>_____</p><p>DDR SuperNova Arcade</p><p>So far during my stay i've spent a bit of cash playing DDR Supernova.  Konami has a card that you can purchase deemed the e-Amusement Card and all the recent Konami arcade games i've come across have used it.  It will save your scores, achievements, and other various data for the games you play.  I've only used it on DDR Supernova, but it can be used on Guitar Freaks V3, Drum Mania V3, Pop 'n Music Fever, this Martian Attack game, and so forth.  For DDR Supernova it will save your scores and rankings for applicable Non-stop mixes.</p><p>Supernova boasts nearly 300 songs that are new and old.  It has about 1/3 new songs for the arcade, and 2/3 revival songs from previous arcade mixes.  Of the 1/3 new songs, 1/3 of those are songs that are new to the arcade, but have been featured in console mixes before.  There's about 70 NEW songs featured in the arcade box.  I'm really interested to see how this compares to the US release of Supernova last week.  I'm really loving Xepher, the Seduction remix, AA, the new Des-Row songs, and the new Max 300 mix.  Otherwise i've been playing Quickening and Tsugaru Apple mix a bit, along with the occasional Paranoia Survivor.  Max 300, Maxx Unlimited, and Legend of Max are included, along with Paranoia Respect ^_^.  No Max Period though.</p><p>Overall, DDR Supernova is pretty slick, but it's missing a couple old songs that i would have liked to see.  I'm really sad that Rhythm & Police is not included, but oh well...  can't have everything.  The Non-stop mixes have been rather uninspired as well..</p><p>It's always fun to go into the arcade and dance up a storm to see the reaction of the japanese nerds playing their Dynasty Warriors game.  I've seen a few people who are pretty good at DDR, but overall, no one has really stepped up to kick my ass other than Kyle.<br/>_____</p><p>So yeah...  these 3 games, along with the Rakubiki Jiten have been my primary games at the moment.  I stopped playing Mario Kart after i defeated the Mirror cc class.  I'll probably get back into that later after i finish up Pokemon.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085"

Instant stuff does not compare to the delicious-ness.</p><p>As we exited the nook, there was a crowd around a little book store.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04141.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04141.webp" /></p><p>Apparently, there was an impromptu showcase of little girl that knew how to play the Piano really really well.  This first girl we saw was amazing, but this second girl got up and just plain sucked.  She wasn't stern enough with her finger pounding so it was too quiet, and the song choice wasn't really all that captivating.  So we took off to look for clothing stores and other places.</p><p>I found some <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04142.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04142.webp">interesting pants</a> in this hip-hop clothing shop:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04143.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04143.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04143.webp" /></p><p>West-side Nagasaki... all the way. I think that one mannequin is doing the shocker.<br/>I finally did find a pretty good engrish shirt on my daily travels:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04144.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04144.webp" /></p><p>This was really all i could find though.  Truely great Engrish shirts are tough to find around here.  I wonder if its like that for all of japan.  We went in and out of several clothing stores, but it was almost all American clothing.  Oddly enough, Kyle found a shirt from his High School at one of the stores.  What an eerie feeling.</p><p>We came across a store that was alot like Spencer's Gifts.  The had alot of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04145.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04145.webp">Colonel Sander's</a> keychains, a creepy <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04146.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04146.webp">McDonald's hat</a>, and some interesting <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04148.webp">Winter wear</a>.  I don't think those hats would work very well when robbing a bank.</p><p>We went to a few more places but got tired of not finding anything particularly engrish.  I bought some more groceries at the local stores.  Mainly more curry and some instant ramen.  I bought a bowl too so i could actually eat the ramen.</p><p>I was quite delicious ^_^.  here's the ramen i purchased:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04150.webp" /></p><p>It was $1 and it came with enough for 2 people.  It easy to cook, just as any ramen.  Just dump all the contents into a pot or pan:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04151.webp" /></p><p>Cook for a while:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04154.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04154.webp" /></p><p>and viola!  Food:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04155.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04155.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04155.webp" /></p><p>This stuff was very very good.  I think american Instant ramen could take a few lessons about NOT deep frying their noodles.  I think if i picked up some eggs and fishcake it would make this the best tasting instant ramen ever made.  Perhaps some spice would help out things too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Taito Game Station" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/taito-game-station">Taito Game Station</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

O_o.</p><p>After my japanese class on Friday, i met up with Mark about some school festivel deal that he wanted to talk to me about.</p><p>Each year, on the first weekend of November, the Nagasaki school holds an international festivel where each culture presents a food dish for sale.  This year, since the american group was so large, they were able to split us up into 2 groups.  Mark went through all this paperwork on his own since the deadline was actually today.  He bought Shane in charge of one of the groups and myself in charge of the other.</p><p>All the paperwork was filled out and set to go, except we needed to make an advertisement for the festivel pamphlet.  Mark had signed up the other group to work on Hamburgers, and signed up us to do Tacos... O_o.  the great american food, apparently.  That's fine ^_^.  Tacos are delicious.</p><p>I ran down to the office to get the form needed to make an advertisement and spent a good part of the day drawing it out:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04082.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04082.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04082.webp" /></p><p>Wheeee...  i forgot to write a bunch of Engrish on it though like... "Enjoy tasty delicious American sensation in your Mouth!"..  or "Taco is American super awesome delight"..  or something like that.  oh well.  The women down in the international office thought it was pretty slick.</p><p>While drawing this up, i mentioned those kickass Evangelion Mermaid statues to Kyle, and told him i'd pay him 1000 yen for each statue he would win me.  Kyle has been rather addicting to those crane games, but unfortunately (or fortunately) he hasn't found one that had anything he liked..  The thought of making some money on them did appeal to him, so we walked down to Sega World after school.</p><p>I started off by putting $2 in the machine to see if i could get something.  It seemed pretty easy.  You just needed to line up the horizontal, line up the vertical, and hit the clench button when the crane was lined up with the holes in the side of the box.  Piece of cake ^_^.</p><p>Well i missed the first time.  Then i put a $5 coin in the machine for 3 tries.  I came closer and closer to victory.</p><p>I was $7 down, but it seemed so easy.  I put in another $5 coin and made way to the asuka statue.  Left Left a little, then back and....  CLENCH.  HUZZAH!..  a perfect grasp.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04083.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04083.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04083.webp" /></p><p>cha-ching!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04085.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04085.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04085.webp" /></p><p>I still had 2 tries left..  so i made way for the nearby Rei statue.  Arghhh... so close.  and Again with another miss.  $12 for one statue..  But if i got the Rei statue, then i'd have 2 for $14.  That seemed like a good deal.  Left Left, Up and CLENCH!..  miss.  Left Left, up and CLENCH!.. miss.  Whatever.. one more try then i'm quitting..  Left Left, Up and CLENCH!...  ahh.. dammit.  So DAMN close that time...  I thought i had lost it, but as the Crane moved back up, and actually held onto the box.  Whoo hoo..  The box fell out of the grasp halfway up, but it fell down all the same.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04086.webp" /></p><p>Wheeee....</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04089.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04089.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04089.webp" /></p><p>Ahh... it feels good to get what you want for a reasonable price.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Karma?" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/karma">Karma?</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 28, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>so it looks like my days of poking stray cats with sticks have come full circle.</p><p>Last night, a cute little kitty found itself inside our dorm.  Once Bryan saw the cute little fur ball, it took off running in the opposite direction down the hallway, straight into the Kitchen.  One of the japanese guys was cooking dinner inside, so the kitty stopped in it's tracks and shot off down the hall again.  This time it found itself in my room where i was 'reading' a magazine.</p><p>"holy crap! more humans..  oh my god!?," the cute kitten thought in terror as it turned the hell around and shut back down the hall from where it came.  Bryan and the japanese guy had the hallway cornered off, so it turned around pretty fast.  It shot down the hallway right in front of me as i jumped out of my room.  It tried to runaway as fast as it could, but stood still as its claws scrapped against the slippery bare wood floors.</p><p>I leaned down and snatcher it in my grasp.  The little sweetheart went furious in my hands, thinking it would be done for.  She scratched and bit at my hand for me to release my grasp, all while hissing her little head off.</p><p>"ARharhgghhgghhgg.... gawd," as i tried to hold on to her.  Finally the pain was too much, and i tossed her out the nearby open window onto the roof.  My hand bled quite a bit, but the japanese guy had one cut in the middle of his finger that would not stop bleeding.  The little kitty ran around on the roof a little bit trying to get away.  Eventually she took a look over the edge and jumped off.</p><p>Our battle wounds were present, and the kitten had fled.  This type of thing doesn't happen in Pokemon Snap, i thought.</p><p>She was a cute little kitty too..  Too bad i didn't get my camera out in time to snap a few shots.  I only have the maul wounds as a memory..</p><p>___</p><p>In other news, Leigh and I went to Togitsu this morning right as the stores were opening and got ourselves a copy of Pokemon Diamond.  Diamond is clearly the cool version, as the Pearl version is all pink and girly.

The reason they are labeled Death cigarettes is because they are unfiltered, so you get the pure joy of screwing over your lungs.</p><p>Around the corner i saw a little stray cat run by, so i took off after it to snap a picture</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03984.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03984.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03984.webp" /></p><p>This was the best i could take before it took off in the other direction, through traffic, and then between a couple houses.</p><p>I swear...  taking pictures of cats around here is alot like Pokemon Snap for N64.  You have to be quick and cunning to snap the perfect picture, otherwise they'll run away and you'll miss your opportunity.  In other cases, you need to bait them out into the open to get a good shot.  And other cats will just come up to you and hang out without giving a shit.  And in other cases you need to poke them with sticks for fun.</p><p>I proceeded down the road to take a look into the Sumiyoshi You-Ing for some more games.  I found a copy of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03986.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03986.webp">IQ Final</a> for $5, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03987.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03987.webp">Stand Alone Complex</a> Production notes with a sweet cover, and the LE <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03995.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03995.webp">cover for Advent Children</a>.  That was a bit pricey though.

It was still about 2pm though, so i needed something to do.  I decided to venture forth into the unknown and see where i'd end up..  I took off in the opposite direction, away from the city and places that i knew of..  I came into an intersection, and went underneath a tunnel:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" /></p><p>Besides mountains, naturally, Japan also has quite a bit of tunnels.  We went through about 10 tunnels on over journey from Fukuoka to Nagasaki.</p><p>On the other side of this tunnel was a Hydro electric plant:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" /></p><p>There was a guy on the top of the damn practicing Martial Arts and doing kicks in mid-air.  It reminded me of Rocky for some reason.  This guy was in tip-top physical condition.  After doing all these air kicks, he took off running past me and along the river bed.</p><p>I continued walking towards that direction, since it led back into town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" /></p><p>Probably the most prevalent thing i've learned from studying abroad is the amount of distance one can cover by simply walking.  Besides the 30 minute walk to school each day, i've spent at least 4 hours walking around from here to there.  I'm sure i walk around 5 or 6 miles a day.  When i get home in the night, i'm so fricken tired that i usually just instantly go to bed.</p><p>Anyways, i made my way back to the strip, bought some curry, and went back home.  Here's some panoramic shots i took because i was bored: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04034.webp">here's the bridge over the train tracks</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04043.webp">here's the Toys R Us</a> near the dorm.<br/>____</p><p>I should be set now that i've picked up a bunch of instant curry and a rice cooker.  I should be able to eat on $2 a day, rather than the $15 i've been spending out until now.</p><p>Instant Curry is rather delicious ^_^.  I've picked up enough for the next week.</p><p>It's quite easy to make as well.  Inside the box is a little silver package.  You stick this into boiling for a little while to cook it.  5 minutes later, it's done ^_^.  Just empty out the package on rice and you're set to eat it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nagasaki Temples" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nagasaki-temples">Nagasaki Temples</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Rez was originally designed for the Dreamcast with hardware and graphic capibilities in mind.  The PS2 port is a little bit muffled, since UGA didn't redesign it for the PS2 hardware, so Dreamcast Rez really is the best version.  Also, the dreamcast version was only offered online through Sega Direct, so you weren't able to buy it in stores..  I really was quite lucky to find it.  Now all i need is a Dreamcast VGA cable, and i will be able to experience rez in the best visual capacity.  Hopefully, i'll find some good headphones before i get back.</p><p>I also found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03634.webp">Lapucelle Tactics</a> with its beautiful japanese cover, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03637.webp">Mo-jib Ribbon</a>, and...

Not too shabby.</p><p>I continued walking around Togitsu to see what i could see.  I walked across the harbor area and came across the absolute CUTEST kitty i've seen in Japan thus far..  It was this tiny little black cat, with a cute little pink collar w/ a little bow..  I walked up near it and it meowed at me..  OH MY GOD!! It was the cutest meow you've ever heard in your entire life...  This meow could literally melt evil.  I sat down with the kitty and pet it for a while..  Lost in the cute-ness.  Eventually when i got up, it started following me a ways..  AWWWWWWWWWWwwwww...  Unfortunately, it was too dark for a picture..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03649.webp" /></p><p>I continued down the river a little bit.  Togitsu is a rather clear town.  The wind is nice coming from the bay.  On my way back i noticed the Yamada electronic store.  Hey..  i have a point card at Yamada.  Plus i need Rice Cooker.  So let's check it out..</p><p>Inside i found these weird iPod speakers:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03650.webp" /></p><p>Also, the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03653.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03653.webp">Initial D</a> live action movie, the PS2 version of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03654.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03654.webp">Evangelion</a> Pachinko machines i saw earlier, AND also <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03655.webp">XII Stag</a> for $5.
