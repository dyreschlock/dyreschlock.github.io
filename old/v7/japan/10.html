| September 22, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Today was such a beautiful.  It was completely sunny without a cloud in the sky.  And as the sun set, the sky continued to stay completely clear, void of clouds.  As Summer continues to wane, and Fall becomes the official season, I think there will be more and more days like this.</p><p>This was the first night in a very long time without any cloud cover.  There was no moon, either.  It was 11pm, so I decided to look up how to take night images with my camera, and then I tested it from my apartment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7464_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Holy crap, this actually worked.  A little bit, anyway.  There was a spot on my lens.  Plus, I needed to cut out almost all the darkness from the levels, and crank the brightness a little bit.  But, I could see quite a bit of stars. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Into the Dark</b></div><p>Obviously the best places to take starry photos are from really really dark places.  Living in the mountains is perfect for this opportunity because there is very little light pollution.  Takayama is small, but it's still the biggest city around here, and gives off some light pollution.  I wanted to test my camera a little further.  So, I hopped in my car, and drove to <b>Nyuukawa <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>丹生川</span></span></b>.</p><p>Nyuukawa Village probably has about 4000 people.  It's mostly mountains and forested wilderness, but the area nearest Takayama has some wide open farmland.  I drove west from central Nyuukawa until I came across what looked like an open space.  I think I actually parked in some guy's driveway.</p><p>I could see everything.  I could see the Milky Way galaxy, and the millions and millions of stars throughout the entire night sky.  It was..  huge.  Sure, it was faint.  But being engulfed in most darkness allows the eyes to adjust.  </p><p>I laid down on the ground, and looked up at the starry sky.  A bizarre feeling of dizziness came over me.  Like I was going to fall over, but I was already lying down.  I guess that's vertigo, right?  The vastness of space was laid out before me.  The near infinite landscape of the cosmos.  I saw a shooting star, too!</p><p>Anyway, I set up my camera, and took some photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7474_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140922_stars/IMG_7482_t.webp" /></a></p><p>They turned out way more clear than the ones I took from my apartment.

| September 20, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Takayama City <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高山市</span></span> is known in Japan as a city that has kept its Edo period roots.  The old streets and sake breweries in the heart of the city, and being completely surrounded by mountains and nature convey these old feelings.  There really isn't another place like it.</p><p>Before it was created in this image, Takayama was the site of a few battles.  In the 1500s, some dude named Yoritsuna seized the Hida province and built the Matsukura castle <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>松倉城</span></span> to defend it.  Some decades later, Kanamori <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>金森</span></span> was ordered to attack Yoritsuna and capture Hida, who then ruled the Echizen Ono Castle <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>越前大野城</span></span>, which you might remember as the 3rd castle on my <a href="/old/v7/20-castle-stamp-rally" title="/20-castle-stamp-rally" title="/20-castle-stamp-rally">20 Castle Stamp Rally Card</a>.  </p><p>Kanamori battled and defeated Yoritsuna in 1585, and became the ruler of Hida.  Matsukura Castle was a warrior's castle, though.  It was built for battling and defending, but this is not what Kanamori and his clan wanted for Takayama.  In 1588, Kanamori began construction of the Takayama Castle <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>高山城</span></span>, and basically created Takayama in the image of a castle town.  He's basically the founder of modern day Takayama, and you can find all kinds of info and artifacts about Kanamori in the Takayama Museum of History and Art.  After his capture of Takayama, it basically became a peaceful place.</p><p>Matsukura Castle was abandoned, and eventually destroyed somehow.  The rules of this castle (and the Takayama Castle) are still present today.  Though, the Takayama Castle ruins aren't nearly as interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>松倉城</span></span></b></div><p>The site of the Matsukura Castle is located near current Matsukura Junior High School <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>松倉中</span></span>, on the southwest corner of the heart of Takayama City.  This time I actually went hiking with a friend. :)  After lunch, we began around 2pm.</p><p>To get to the ruins, drive up the hill past Hida no Sato <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>飛騨の里</span></span>, and you'll find a plateau where you can park.  From there, you will find a path that leads up into the forest.  It takes about 10 minutes if you're driving from Takayama Station.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" /></p><p>The path is only 250 meters, and it takes about 5 or 10 minutes to hike through the slightly rocky terrain.  Being in such close proximity to the city allows the trails to be easily well kept, and well traveled..  There were really no traces of any large animals along the trail, either.

Other areas slightly covered with foliage.  At some point, there was even a climbing rope provided to help us walk up a 40/45 degree incline.  The map indicated this was a walking path, but as my friend continued to mention, this wasn't really walking at all.  It was hiking.</p><p>I took some pictures, but we continued to press on.  We were supposed to come across some kind of house marked on the map, but we didn't see anything.  After traveling a full kilometer we reached a fork in the road and a sign that said we reached the walking path we thought we were on.  Apparently we took some kind of rough shortcut.

The Gifu Kendo Federation provides a book which details all the questions and answers they use for this test.  </p><p>I will take the test in November, and unfortunately for me, it's all in Japanese.  So, I translated the book into English, and then made a few edits with a kendo dictionary after.</p><p><i>Currently</i>, this is a work in progress.  I've completely translated the first 3 parts.  But for the 4th part of the book, I only translated the shodan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>初段</span></span> level questions for now.  I'll do the rest after November.</p><p>You can download my translation and take a look for yourselves, at the following link:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYXdSTmM5TzZFTGs/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYXdSTmM5TzZFTGs/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MYXdSTmM5TzZFTGs/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs/ <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>剣道学科審査問題集</span></span> Kendo Exam Question Workbook - WOP-2014-09-11.pdf</a></p><p>It's a PDF.

It literally translates as "way of the sword," and across Japan tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of elementary, junior high, high school, college students, and regular citizens practice or have practiced Kendo at some point in their life.</p><p>I began practicing Kendo in April 2013 when the junior high school I taught at continued to ask me to join them in their practices.  It's been great exercise, great stress relief, and I've met so many people throughout the community through this sport.</p><p>Much like every martial art, Kendo has an idea of ranking, similar to the black belt system in Karate.  Kendo has two levels of mastery, Kyuu <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>級</span></span>, and Dan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>段</span></span>.  To achieve these ranks, you must take an exam.  And in Gifu prefecture <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>岐阜県</span></span>, these exams are proctored by the Gifu-ken Kendo Association.  They visit the Takayama area 4 times a year.</p><p>The first level, kyuu <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>級</span></span>, builds up from higher number to lower.  So, 1-kyuu <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>一級</span></span> is the highest rank on the kyuu scale.  From there, the next level is dan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>段</span></span>, in which numbers increase.</p><div class='title'><b>Not Ranked</b></div><p>You gotta start somewhere.  If you're a junior high school student, or older, when taking the test for the first time, the requirements are similar to the 1-kyuu <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>一級</span></span> test.  Afterward, the judges will assign a grade to you.</p><p>I took the unranked exam in November last year.  My exam had two parts.  I had to perform all 9 waza for kihon-waza with a bukkuto.  Then needed to perform a series of moves attacking an opponent.</p><p>Kihon-waza are a series of movements in kendo that are practiced slowly and methodically.  This series are some of the most basic moves you can perform within a kendo match.  Performing them in this way teaches correct posture, body movement, foot movement, and shinai movement.</p><p>Here's a youtube clip of the waza being performed:<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj6V_sT2dnQ</a></p><p>Additionally, you must perform some moves in realtime against an opponent.  For unranked, I had to perform kiri-kaeshi, men-no-uchi, kote-men-no-uchi, men-kaeshi-dou, and men-suriage-men.</p><p>I messed up the men-suriage-men.  They blamed it on my opponent, though, and let me try again.  Again, I messed it up, so they realized it was my fault not his.</p><p>But overall, I was awarded 2-kyuu <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>二級</span></span>!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6389.webp" /></p><p>This put me on the same level as the 5th grade elementary students I practiced with each week.  Actually, many of my students were taking the exam as well, and got 2-kyuu, too!</p><div class='title'><b>1-Kyuu Exam <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>一級</span></span></b></div><p>In June this year, I took the 1-kyuu exam.  This test had 3 parts.  It had the same 2 parts from the unranked tests: the kihon-waza, and the series of real-time moves.  In addition, I also had to take part in an example shiai, or match.</p><p>Within the match, I had to demonstrate how I attack and strike my opponent, and show as much variety as possible.  I didn't need to win, or get as many valid strikes as possible.  I just need to demonstrate I knew how to initiate attacks, reacts to incoming attacks, and that all my movements were in sync.</p><p>I think I was a little stiff in some actions, but my mind was 100% centered on the moves I was performing, and what was happening within the match.  I tuned out everything around me, and forgot about the world.  It was only my opponent and myself that existed.  It may have been the first time I actually felt this way.  Usually, I'm very conscious of instruction, and how I look performing these moves, but I couldn't focus on that.  I pushed it all out of my mind.  </p><p>I did all this MAINLY because I was the last person to do this test.  They put me in the back because I was so tall and couldn't "measure" to the other test takers.  So, no one else was in line behind me.  Everyone else had already finished.  I was the only one on the floor, and all the other participants, families, judges, and whomever else were all watching me.  Maybe 200 people?</p><p>I do get a little stage fright in front of so many people, but this is compounded.  Everyone is Japanese.  I'm the only white guy here.  I stand out quite a bit (literally).  And I'm the only white guy, in the history of Takayama (possibly in all Gifu), to do Kendo and take these tests.  The nervousness of failing or succeeding or looking dumb or just looking anything was just too great because it felt like I was representing more than just myself.</p><p>So I had to tune it out.  Which is what I should being doing a match in the first place.</p><p>And my concentration paid off.  I achieved the rank of 1-kyuu!  Along with all my students, both elementary and junior high. :D</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6383.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Shodan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>初段</span></span></b></div><p>Having mastered kyuu, the next level of mastery of dan.  The first level is shodan <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>初段</span></span>.  The requirements for shodan are completely different than that of kyuu.  There are 3 parts.  </p><p>There's a new set of waza that must be learned.  These are Nippon Kendo Kata.  For shodan, only the first 5 waza must be performed.  These feature very advanced moves, which are more complicated and intricate than the kihon-waza from before.</p><p>You also must perform in several shiai, or matches.  I think they group together 4 test takers, and everyone takes turn battling each other.  Again, I don't think you need to actually win these matches.  Just demonstrate that you can correctly attack and respond with appropriate behavior.</p><p>The third part is the written exam, which is the whole reason for this post.  The exam pulls questions from the following book.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140915_kendo/IMG_6190.webp" /></p><p>This is the book I translated.  One questions is always asked, and 2 others are randomly chosen.  I translated all the shodan level stuff, and after giving them the translation, I should be able to answer these questions in English. :)  Also, one of the English teachers I practice kendo with said they'll let him translate my answers back to Japanese for the judges.</p><p>For the next 2 months, I need to continue to practice all this stuff, so I can pass the test.  Ganbattemasu!<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to September Harvest Moon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/september-moon">September Harvest Moon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Which is what happens when the moon is the closest to the Earth on its orbit, and also happens to be a full or new moon, too.

| September 7, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Today was a beautiful September day in Takayama.  There was a little rain over night, but the weather completely cleared up, and today had completely blue skies all day.  Throughout the summer, there have been many rainy days.  Nice weather like this only happens for a few hours at a time.  Not for an entire day.</p><p>The staff at one of my school's recommended that I hike a nearby mountain named <b>Juunigatake</b> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳</span></span> located in the village of Nyukawa <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>丹生川</span></span> which is within the borders of Takayama City.  Juunigatake literally translates as Mt. 12.</p><p>After a little Internet searching, I found out how to get there, and took off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" /></p><p>Google Maps had brought me to a small pocket of farms in the Gonbo <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>根肩</span></span> neighborhood of Nyukawa at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833">N36° 10' 34.68", E137° 22' 37.14"</a>.  Between a few fields of rice was a road that led up into the mountains.  At the entrance to the road was a temple, and several signs that warned about forest fires.  Also, near the entrance were some sandbags left over from the flash flooding that occurred a few weeks ago.</p><p>I started to climb the trail with my car, but the road was incredibly damaged by the flood.  Narrow mountain roads make excellent canals for running flood water.  I'm sure that was a decent dirt trail before, but all the loose dirt had been washed away leaving rocks, and some remaining mud.  Some storm drains had been <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5773.webp">knocked out</a> of their positions, so <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5775.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5775.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5775.webp">I fixed it</a>, and continued.</p><p>In my mind, I kept thinking that I should turn around.  One of my car tires will get stuck, or my car will bottom-out, or one of these rocks will puncture my tire.  This is actually dangerous.  Sense and reason finally prevailed.  I turned my car around, exited the trail, parked, and began walking up the road.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" /></p><p>My car did not make it very far, and it was very sobering to continue this trail on foot and see just how doomed this journey would have been.  One stretch of road was half-collapsed with a fissure splitting it in two.  Nearby rock slides had washed out part of the road, too.  It was totally impassable by car.</p><p>After almost a kilometer hike up the steep trail, the forest began to open up, and grass had began to creep into the trail.  The blue sky was overhead, and I came across a couple of buildings.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" /></p><p>The road forked to the left which had two old homes.  There are here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222">N36° 10' 49.89", E137° 22' 29.72"</a>.  Abandoned, and left to rot.  The doors were locked tight, and the windows were boarded.  One of homes had some old tools underneath part of the roof, but nothing seemed like it had any normal use.  I did not pry.</p><p>A few more meters down this road led to the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5796.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5796.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5796.webp">back of someone's farm</a>.  There were some vegetable fields, and plenty of rice fields too.  I could see the owner near his house, too.  He was trimming weeds near his home.  I guess he must own these rundown homes.  Or at least, perhaps, he's the current property owner.</p><p>What I found VERY curious was I could clear see modern vehicles parked at his house.  One of which was another small kei car like mine.  How the hell did he get those up here?</p><p>Well, after going back to the fork in the road, and continuing, I came across pavement.  Apparently this washed up, damaged road was not the correct way to get to my mountain, and I'm an idiot.  I reexamined my map, then went back to my car to meet this road on the other side.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" /></p><p>Hey, look at that.  After driving the correct way into the mountain, there's an actual sign and a map detailing where I'm supposed to go.  This looks like the right place.  <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556">N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately the pavement did not last long.  But the road was not washed out or damaged by the flood, so my car could continue.  The view was mostly obscured by brush, but it was an easy drive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5837.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5845.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5847.webp" /></p><p>I came to the first fork in the road at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444">N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"</a>, and the main sign for the trail had been split from its posts by the wind.

I stopped a few times to clear some of the larger ones out of the way to make sure my car wouldn't be damaged.</p><p>There were many times when the surrounding grass had grown so wildly, it completely engulfed my car as I passed through it.

| September 3, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>On the border between Takayama City, and Hida City, between Kiyomi Village and Furukawa Town, there lies a mountain named Ibuseyama <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>猪臥山</span></span>.  The website said it was famous, but when I mentioned it to a few local teachers, none of them had heard of it.  The peak of Ibuseyama is about an hours drive from Furukawa, so I decided to take a look.</p><p>Out of Furukawa, there's a road named Hwy 90, and it acts as a shortcut for people in western Hida City to reach the tollway entrance in Kiyomi, named the Hida Kiyomi IC <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>飛騨清見</span></span>IC.  The road starts off rather large and straight, but there are pockets of houses that do not allow the road to continue this way.  The road windily climbs up the side of a mountain and through a forest.  At its peak, the road levels off, widens, and continues straight once again.  After the road widens, it goes through a near 4.5km long tunnel, and then you're nearly at the tollway entrance.</p><p>To get to Ibuseyama, you need to turn into a neighborhood right before this tunnel.  This one: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111">N36° 13' 14.45", E137° 9' 0.4"</a>.  In fact, this very turn can be seen from the peak of Ibuseyama.  The road becomes very narrow, and the forest becomes thicker, and more debris is scattered on the road since very few people actually go this way.</p><p>After 20 minutes from Furukawa, you reach a very remote area of Kiyomi Village <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>清見村</span></span>, the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>小鳥町</span></span>.  Here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222">N36° 12' 22.42", E137° 6' 19.88"</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" /></p><p>There's a crossroads here.  I stopped my car, and got out to take this photo.  After standing, there was absolutely no sound.  No running water.  No wind.  No animals.  Nothing.  It was dead silent.  Once crossed into this remote area of Kiyomi, it was like I entered a dead zone.  Maybe it was haunted.</p><p>Anyway, at this crossroads, I had two choices. Make a left and continue to the mountain, or continue straight through the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>小鳥町</span></span> of Kiyomi. I went left.</p><p>The road is paved, which is nice, but much of the pavement is cracked and bulging from the movement of rock underneath, erosion by water and melted snow on the top, or landslides that had previously taken out part of the road.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>My little car continued to climb.  I went past several hairpin turns exceeding 180 degrees.  There were several drop offs with no guardrails.  And lots of loose rock covering the roads making it sometimes difficult for my car to get a foothold.  </p><p>With every passing turn, the height of the forest became a little shorter, and more sky started shinning through.  There were more dramatic plateaus, and more dramatic views of the distance I've traveled.</p><p>I stopped a few times to take photos, but after 30 minutes, I reached the end of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444">N36° 11' 27.9", E137° 6' 48.04"</a>.

That was a mere 15 years ago.  Most of its residents worked in the mining facilities throughout the land.  But in 2003, the mines was shut, closed, and were no longer in service.  The workers were fired, or relocated, or whatever..  They left Kamioka for greener pastures.  It's most recent census, in 2004, puts the population of Kamioka at around 10,000.</p><p>When I first visited Kamioka over a year ago, the first thing I noticed was the rail line suspended over part of the town, and going through some of the mountains in town.  It looked rundown, and, upon closer inspection, was no longer in service, and mostly abandoned.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Railway History</b></div><p>According to <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A">Wikipedia</a>, if I'm reading this right..  The current Kamioka Railway was officially opened in 1966, and exclusively shipped freight from the zinc mines in Kamioka.</p><p>In 1984, the mines adopted the world-wide standard for shipping containers, and had to ship freight by truck.  They still used the lines for shipping other things, but to make up for the costs, the railway was now open to the public.  However, every year operated in a hefty loss.</p><p>After 2003, with the loss of the mines, there were significant shortages of freight and passengers.  In 2004, what was left of the mines ceased its freight transports, and then completely cut its use of the railway.  That hefty loss turned into a massive, unjustifiable loss.</p><p>The railway completely ceased operations on December 1st, 2006.  And the bus system made up for the lack of public transportation.</p><p>In 2008, rather than demolish the railway, the city of Kamioka opened the <b>Kamioka Gattan Go!</b> service, which allowed anyone to rent a bicycle contraption, and ride along the last 3km in the rail line within Kamioka proper.

Local trains usually stop here, and exchange passengers, and personnel.  Express trains bound from Toyama to Nagoya usually blow through.</p><p>But, despite being a checkpoint station, the place is pretty small.  Trains don't run through here very often either.  The timetable listed less than 10 trains stop here each day.  When I was walking around, there was a train waiting at one of the platforms, but it wasn't scheduled to leave for another 50 minutes.  I met some local workers on their way to that train who must've only been working for half a day.</p><p>Across the street from the station was a very small omiyage shop.  It just looked like a corner store.  The old woman who ran the shop was by the station chatting with a taxi driver who looked equally bored.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>Technically, this is the beginning of the Kamioka Railway, but it's the end of my journey.  The Railway had interested me in quite a while, so it was great to finally see the 19.9km stretch of rail from beginning to end.  There's still some more research I could do, but I think Japanese Wikipedia has much of it covered.  I'm still curious on how frequent the trains ran, the price of the fare.</p><p>Wikipedia mentioned that the Kamioka Railway may have only run 8 times a day.  Which is interesting, because the Takayama Line out of Inotani Station seemed to run just as frequent.  I wonder how much longer the Takayama Line will be cost effective, or if it even is cost effective at the moment.  The bus system covers much more ground at a cheaper price.  And the northern central shinkansen line just completed construction all the way to Kanazawa.  When that line goes all the way to Kyoto and Shin-Osaka, the Takayama line will become even less traveled.</p><p>I always considered Japan a marvel at public transportation, but with the areas in the mountains so wide and remote, it's just not feasible.  If you live out here, you basically need a car.</p><p>Anywyay, urban decay, yeah!<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 20 Castle Stamp Rally" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/20-castle-stamp-rally">20 Castle Stamp Rally</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Well, it wasn't actually a flyer.  It was a Stamp Rally, and these things are pretty popular in Japan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6445.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6445.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6445.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Castle Stamp Rally <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>お城スタンプラリー</span></span></b></div><p>A Stamp Rally is a flyer or sheet of paper with a bunch of empty squares.  Each empty square indicates a location.  When you go to each of the locations there's a rubber stamp.  And you stamp the image into the empty square on your Stamp Rally sheet.  Also, rather than locations, sometimes a Stamp Rally can happen at just one location, but the rubber stamps change each week.  Once collect all (or most of) the stamps, you turn in your sheet for a fabulous prize.  Or sometimes it's just a chance to win a prize.</p><p>You can usually find these things at festivals.  Several local merchants might get together, and make a stamp rally to jointly advertise their stores.  Sometimes towns might create a stamp rally to advertise all their historical landmarks.  No matter what the subject, it all comes down to advertising.</p><p>The Stamp Rally that I found was to visit 20 of the Japanese castles in the Chubu region of Japan.  As I later found out, these aren't Chubu's only castles, but this Stamp Rally fell in line with a secret item on my bucket list.</p><div class='title'><b>Visiting Castles!</b></div><p>After visiting a couple of castles in Kyushu, I bought a book that listed all of the currently standing castles in Japan, as well as sites of ruined castles.  I thought it would be a fun idea to visit every single one of these throughout the course of my life, so I (mentally) added it to my bucket list.  </p><p>Though, after visiting 5 castles in Kansai over the course of one vacation, this goal began to feel a bit shallow.  What did I really hope to gain from visiting all these places?  How was this going to better my life?  This was more of an exercise in quantity, than quality.  I didn't care or remember enough of the history to make these visits actually worthwhile.  I just liked the aesthetic.  But, in that case, once you've seen a couple of castles, you've mostly seen them all.</p><p>Also, not all Japanese castles are built the same these days.  Some castles still hold the wooden forms and original design, like Himeji <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>姫路</span></span> and Inuyama <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>犬山</span></span>.  Others are modern buildings in the shape of the original castle, like Osaka <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>大阪</span></span>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6446.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6446.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6446.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140504_toyama_castle/IMG_6446.webp" /></p><p>Anyway!</p><p>Visiting all these castles seemed like a fun idea, and even though it emphasized quantity over quality, the journey itself held fulfillment of its own.  Plus!  If you get all 20, you get some kind of prize!  Fuck it, let's do this.  There's a 8 month time limit, so there's plenty of time.</p><p>I'm going to list these in my own personal visiting order, sorted by different trips.</p><div class='title'><b>Trip #1 - May 4th</b></div><p>After obtaining the stamp rally card in April, the Golden Week string of holidays was the first chance I had to actually go somewhere outside of Takayama.  So, I went down to Toyama to do a little shopping, and collect the first stamp on my card.</p><div class='title'><b>1.

The castle is not an original, and it's pretty small, too.  It's a modern building with a full museum stuffed inside of it.  The museum shows the lineage of the ruling class, and how the city looked back in its castle days.  </p><p>The observation deck is on the 4th floor pretty close to the ground, and you can't really see anything from up there.  You only over look the castle park, and part of the main street that connects to the castle.  You could see more of Toyama City, if you went to the top floor of one of the nearby hotels.</p><p>And with the museum inside bulging the building to the left and right, the building itself loosely resembles a castle.</p><p>When I went there, another castle-like building was under construction, so maybe they have future plans to extend the park into a much larger complex.

Inuyama is 100% wood, and holds the exact original design it had from those hundreds of years ago.

And well worth the visit.</p><div class='title'><b>Trip #3 - June 25th</b></div><p>On this particular day, the teachers of Takayama held several demonstration classes in various schools throughout the city.

The Gujo Hachiman Castle towers over Hachiman City, and can easily be seen in most areas.  Hachiman itself is another valley town, like Kamioka.  It's surrounded by massive towering mountains, and the Hachiman Castle rests on the top of one in the middle of town.</p><p>From the castle, you can see just about everywhere in town.  I happened to get there around 5pm, right when the sun begins to set, so it looked beautiful. :)</p><p>Inside the castle, there's still some wooden supports, and construction, but it's not an original like Inuyama.  Some plaster and cement keep the building together, and survive the winter months.  Inside, there's plenty of the usually artifacts: armor, weapons, etc.</p><p>But, I think the view is what you're there for.  There's also a nearby museum.  And you can buy a combo tickets for both the castle and museum at a discount.  Parking isn't too bad either.  On a weekday, when no one's there, you can drive all the way up the mountain to the castle and park for free.  Otherwise, if it's busy, I think both parking and getting up there will be very difficult.</p><div class='title'><b>Trip #4 - August 9th</b></div><p>So far, all my trips have been incidental or convenient.  But with only 3 stamps, I had to start actually planning trips to visit more castles in order to complete the rally.  Most of the castles are located in the central Chubu area in Gifu and Aichi.  Next, I decided to travel to Nagano prefecture, and take care of the northeastern most outlying castles.</p><p>Both the following two castles lie 2 hours east of Takayama.  Thanks to the incoming typhoon, I had a completely free day, so I hopped in my car and made my way east.</p><div class='title'><b>5.

I think for many people, it's a simple rest-stop on the way to Tokyo from Matsumoto or Nagano.  Takashima sits in a flat area nestled between a few mountains.  There's a beautiful rather large lake in the middle of town that's perfect for a nice relaxing day of boating, or whatever.</p><p>Takashima Castle sits in the middle of town, not too far away from the lake, but somewhat far away from the highway.  It does have a nice park area that leverages the stonewalls of the original castle.  There's a quaint pond, with some ridiculous looking ducks.  It's a nice area.</p><p>Inside, Takashima is yet another museum castle, but the building itself is a bit older, and showing some age.  The castle probably doesn't rake in as many tourists as they'd like, so maintenance has fallen by the wayside.  It's a little sad.</p><p>From the top, you can look around and see most of Takashima city, but there are several high-rising hotels that block some of your view.  But really, there's not a lot to see.  Takashima really just feels like a town, rather than a city.  Some people come here to vacation on the weekends because of the lake, but that's really the only attraction.  Takashima doesn't feel like a tourist city.</p><div class='title'><b>4. Matsumoto Castle <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>松本城</span></span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140809_matsumoto_castle/IMG_2494.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140809_matsumoto_castle/IMG_2494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140809_matsumoto_castle/IMG_2494.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140809_matsumoto_castle/IMG_2494.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140809_matsumoto_castle/IMG_2494.webp" /></p><p>After Takashima, I rode back north to Matsumoto castle.  This castle sits in the middle of Matsumoto city and, much like Inuyama castle, it's a completely original recreation.  It's one of the other 4 "nation treasures" and UNESCO world heritage sites, too.  The black castle looks amazing from the outside, and the inside is completely wooden and shows off the original designs for several rooms.</p><p>I've been here before, but on this particular day, it was massively crowded.  It was a Saturday, and during summer vacation.  There were so many people, that they were only allowing so many people in the castle at a time.  And the line to wait was over one hour long.  Fuck that.  It was hot outside, and with the looming typhoon, rain was on its way.  I've been inside before, so I decided to skip it.</p><p>Given the distance from most usually destinations in Japan, I'm not sure if I would recommend taking the time to see it, though.  Inuyama is more conveniently located.  Same with Hikone.  There are some decent restaurants in Matsumoto, though.  There's an amazing ramen restaurant just down the street from the castle.  There are options for shopping, too, but nothing you couldn't find in a larger city.</p><p>Though, I dunno.  Maybe the drive to Matsumoto is worth it.  I live in Takayama, so my drive is a bit more unique than most other's in Japan.  Living in Takayama, I think the drive is absolutely worth it.  There are plenty of hairpin turns as you go up and down several mountains.  There are several old tunnels that are almost too small for the highway busses to squeeze through.  So much so that you fear crashing into one as they pass by.  The scenery is gorgeous.</p><p>Maybe stopping at Matsumoto on the way to Nagano is a viable option.  But, I haven't been to Nagano yet, so I cannot comment.</p><div class='title'><b>Trip #5 - August 13th</b></div><p>With five stamps complete, most of the northern outlying castles have been stamped.  For this trip, I decided to do the exact same thing as the last trip, except travel west to Fukui prefecture.  I left around 11am after finishing some work at school in the morning.  This was my first time going to Fukui prefecture, and the drive from Shirotori <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>白鳥</span></span> west was absolutely stunning.  Beautiful high mountain roadways with amazing views, and several windy forested mountain roads in Fukui.  And no where NEAR as dangerous as the roads east to Matsumoto.  </p><p>As the mountains began to level off, I was met by beautiful green farm land.  Many of the towns I drove through were very similar to Nyukawa and Kamitakara in Takayama.  Just clumped together houses forming neighborhoods.  The remnants of old settlements.</p><p>Ono City was the first really large cluster of homes and buildings on my decent from the mountains, and the Ono Castle was visible quite earlier on.</p><div class='title'><b>3.

Ono City is another flat area surrounded by mountains.  And the Ono castle sits on a rather prominent hill in the middle of the beautiful green area.  Getting to the castle was easy, but actually finding the parking area took a few minutes.  It was right next to the entrance, but there weren't any signs directly pointing to any of it.</p><p>The parking area was on the street level, so to reach the castle required some hiking up the castle hill.  I think it took me 10 minutes to get up there.  Once again, Ono Castle was another recreation that housed a museum with the same things you come to expect.</p><p>The view from Ono Castle was quite beautiful.  Being able to see the castle from far away was definitely a good sign. :)  You could completely see all of Ono City.  And actually unique to Ono Castle, much of the visible terrain from the castle was farm land.  Beautiful green farm land from the rice fields.  Hopefully, I captured some of that atmosphere in my photos.</p><p>I would recommend visiting Ono Castle for the view.  No other castle on this list is surrounded by such an open fertile area.  I think I will come back here next spring and see what the area looks like before everything is planted.  And surrounded by sakura trees, too. :)</p><div class='title'><b>2.

Ono City lied at the end of a highway bypass, so traveling to Maruoka felt like an everyday commute for most people in the city.  My path diverged a little bit, though, to avoid the tollways.</p><p>Maruoka Castle rested in a very nice park in the middle of a neighborhood.  And there was definitely a clear division where the park ended and the neighborhood began.  Not much of the surrounding area had a lot of trees.  It was grey grey grey, then green, somewhat out of nowhere.</p><p>I circled the park until I found the official parking lot.  It looked like a general rest area, though.  Next to the parking lot was a large building that contained a few restaurants, and a few gift shops.  There was plenty of tourist information, too.</p><p>Past the building, and up the greeny hill stood the dark wooden castle.  It was rather small, but it was an original wooden design. :)  Inside housed several relics and photos.  The stairs leading to the upper levels were very steep.  They provided ropes to help make the climb.  The elderly people there had a difficult time with it.</p><p>From the top, you could see quite a bit of Maruoka, including the high school under construction directly next door.  The city looked nice.  To the east you could see the beautiful mountains.  And to the west (on a normal clear day), you could see the Sea of Japan.  Overall, it was very nice. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Next…</b></div><p>I was still at Maruoka Castle, and it was a little after 3pm.  I had 7 stamps, and 13 castles remaining on my list.  Nagahama was the nearest castle to me, but it was still more than one hour away.  Almost all these castles close at 4:30pm, so I would be cutting it close.</p><p>Fuck it…  Let's go.  I took to the highway, and flew down south to greet the castle.  Driving in Japan under a strict time limit almost never works.  There's always too many people driving too slow, or blocking traffic by turning across traffic, or every single stop light showing red.</p><div class='title'><b>20. Nagahama Castle <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>長浜城</span></span></b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140813_nagahama_castle/IMG_2801.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140813_nagahama_castle/IMG_2801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140813_nagahama_castle/IMG_2801.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140813_nagahama_castle/IMG_2801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140813_nagahama_castle/IMG_2801.webp" /></p><p>I made it to Nagahama around 4:30pm, and found the castle, but trying to find the parking area was annoying.  I came in from the north, and there were signs for parking, but they led me all around the park area to the south.  And then it took me another 10 minutes to walk all the way back to the castle.  </p><p>I arrived around 4:55pm, and people were still exited the castle.  I went in, and all the attendants politely said, "Sorry, we're closed."  But not to fret.  Right next to the door where I was standing was the castle stamp!  I was not able to explore the castle, and take any panoramic photos, but I did complete the most basic requirement for coming here.  I walked around and took some photos of the outside, though.</p><p>Nagahama Castle rests on the beach of Lake Biwa, the largest freshwater lake in Japan.  It's not as large as any of the great lakes in the US, but Lake Biwa could be considered a great lake relative to the average size of a Japanese prefecture.  The day was still somewhat hazy, but I could not see across.</p><p>I did not stay in Nagahama for very long, so I didn't really get a sense of the city at all.  There were plenty of high rising hotel on the lakeside, though.  I returned to Takayama since I needed to be at school in the morning.</p><div class='title'><b>Trip #6 (Day 1) - August 14th</b></div><p>I got home around 9pm, and started planning a route to visit the remaining 12 castles.  The 3 castles in Gifu city were mostly clumped together.  So were the 3 Nagoya castles.  The 3 castles in Shizuoka formed a nice straight line with Okazaki castle, too.  That left Hikone and Iga Ueno castles which were mostly near each other in the west.  Here's the map: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3585.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3585.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3585.webp">click!</a>  So, I formed the following plan:</p><p>I had to work for an hour in the morning.  After that, I would visit the Gifu castles, then Hikone, and finish the day with Iga Ueno.  I made a reservation for a hotel close to the Koyama castle, the furthest southern-eastern castle, would start there the next day, and visit all the remaining castles throughout the day.</p><p>The next morning, my student canceled on me, so that gave me an extra hour to get down to Gifu castle, and start crossing castles off my list.</p><div class='title'><b>6.

It's an icon for most of the city.  Much like the Gujo and Ono castles, Gifu castle sits on a large mountain in the middle of the flat town, and can be seen from almost anywhere in the somewhat sprawling city.  From the first time I saw the castle, I wanted to go there.  It's the most beautiful view in all of the city.</p><p>Unfortunately, the weather was not on my side.  Low lying clouds covered the mountain, and the castle.  You could barely see the castle from the city.  And when I actually got up the mountain, I was completely immersed in clouds.  It was difficult to get any decent photos.</p><p>This castle itself was another plaster cement museum, but the view was absolutely worth it.  Or it would've been if I could've seen more than just a fraction of the city.  The hike up the mountain was rather fun and beautiful, too.  I will definitely return to Gifu castle in the fall or the spring, and write a full blog post about it.  But, for now, I got my stamp and continued on my way. </p><div class='title'><b>8.

But with an extra hour in the morning, I decided to get it over with.</p><p>Ogaki castle stood in the middle of Ogaki city, and was over-shadowed but almost every building surrounding it.  I couldn't even see the castle until I turned the corner and was right next to it.  I had a little trouble trying to find parking for the place.  I eventually found a parking lot a few blocks away.  Then it started to rain.</p><p>Ogaki again was another museum, but this museum had a lot more hands-on exhibits.  There were several interactive stations set up for anyone to watch videos explaining the castle, or answers trivia questions.  There was a rather large diorama setup downstairs with figures showing off the daily life of historic Japan.  And they had a bow and gun setup for anyone to hold, and pretend to fire.</p><p>At the top of the castle, you could look around and view the neighboring buildings.  But there really wasn't much of a view.  It's the same thing you'd see if you went into any other building in the city.</p><p>Upon leaving the castle, someone stole my umbrella from the stand.  So, I wasted 40 minutes going to a nearby department store to buy a new one.  Then I made my way to Hikone castle.</p><div class='title'><b>19.

Much like Inuyama and Matsumoto, Hikone Castle is another of the 4 "national treasures" and UNESCO world heritage sites.  The fourth one is Himeji Castle, by the way.  This place was super crowded, and traffic was rather backed up trying to get in.</p><p>Hikone Castle was a rather large complex with several buildings you could walk through.  There was a separate building for the museum, too.  To get to the castle itself, you had to make your way up the castle steps, and across a bridge into the castle's courtyard.  The castle was pretty plain looking from the outside once I got up there.  There was a huge line of people waiting to get in, but with my time table, I could not afford to go inside.  The courtyard gave a pretty nice west view, though.</p><p>The stamp was actually right next to the ticket counter, so I already had what I came for.  Maybe some day I'll come back here, but returning to Gifu castle is higher on my list.  I got back in my car, and started making the 1 hour 30 minute fast track to Ueno Castle before it closed.</p><div class='title'><b>18.

There's no highway or bypass.  The road cut through the country and some smaller cities.  It felt a lot like some of the backroads I used to drive when I was in college, along the Mississippi river from Platteville riding north to Rochester.  It was really nice.  But, it took a really long time.</p><p>Iga is a city similar to Ono in scope.  It's a town further inland away from any metropolis.  I'm sure a lot of the residents use the nearby bypass to commute to work every day or every week.  I arrived at the Iga Castle around 4:30pm, closing time.  And I found parking without too much trouble.</p><p>The castle was surrounded by a densely forested park.  I looked at the map, and followed the signs and made it to the castle.  Some people were still inside, but the front gate was closed.  Shit.  I waited for some people to leave, then I made my entrance.  Last entrance was at 4:30pm, but the place was still open until 5pm.  They didn't let me in the castle, but I was able to get my stamp, and a pamphlet.  Close enough.  I took a few photos, and then left.</p><div class='title'><b>Next…</b></div><p>With all the castles closed for the day, my next task was the travel all the way east to Kakegawa where I reserved a hotel for the evening.  This was 3 1/2 hours away by using the toll road.  The drive was actually rather awesome, with the exception of the traffic jam from Kameyama all the way to Yokaichi.  </p><p>Once I passed Yokaichi, it was quite smooth.  The highway opened up to 3 lanes, and I took the Isewangan Expressway that bypassed Nagoya city.  This stretch of highway is incredible at night.  There are so many lights and colors along this stretch of road.  There's an amusement park completely lit up. There are several ferris wheels pulsating with color. The massive suspension bridges glow white and blue. And there's so much variety in the guard railing and barriers. Plus, being the middle of summer, there were fireworks in the sky nearby.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_driving/IMG_3118.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_driving/IMG_3118.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_driving/IMG_3118.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_driving/IMG_3118.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_driving/IMG_3118.webp" /></p><p>This photo is the exit at the end of the highway.  It does not capture the amazing blue and green lights randomly sprinkled through the road.  It's amazing.  I need to do more road trips in Japan.</p><p>I finally made it to my hotel in Kakegawa around 9:30pm.  I was tired, and I was beat from sitting on my ass all day.  My plan for the next day was to wake up around 6:30am, take a shower, pack up everything, eat some of the free breakfast at 7:00am.  Then make it to Koyama Castle by 8am when it opens.</p><div class='title'><b>Trip #6 (Day 2) - August 14th</b></div><p>Even though, I was beaten and tired, I was fully recharged and ready to tackle my final 7 castles.  I saved all the locations on my Google Maps, so I could easily find them.  I also wrote down all the travel times between the locations to get a sense of timing.  Between all the locations was about 4 1/2 hours worth of travel time.  This only gave me about 3 1/2 hours of "business" time at each location to find parking, get to the castle, take photos, and find the stamp.  For the 7 castles that about 30 minutes each.</p><p>I took my shower, ate my breakfast, stopped at a convenience to bandage a terrible blister on my ankle, then went to Yoshida city, which houses the Koyama Castle.</p><div class='title'><b>12.

The castles don't open at 8am.  They open at 9am.  I made it directly to the castle gates one hour early.  With an hour to kill, I went back to my car and got a full tank of gas.  Then I walked around the castle for a while, and took plenty of photos.</p><p>Around 8:45am, they opened the gates, but the entrance was still closed.  But!  Right inside the gates was the stamp.  I thought about it for a minute, and decided to get my stamp and leave for the next castle.  I did not have any extra time to spend waiting.</p><p>It seemed like another museum castle, though.  The surrounding area was pretty nice.  Koyama sat on the top of the hill in the middle of vast plains.  There was lots of farm land, and the Pacific Ocean wasn't too far away, either.  Yoshida was a very small town, with lots of area.  Very rural, but almost no natural barriers at all to shield from the Pacific winds.</p><p>Honestly, I don't think I'll ever get a chance to come back here.  It's by far the furthest castle away from my house, and the castle is the only landmark in the town.  It's a footnote on the highway from Tokyo to Nagoya.  I wish I would've been able to take some panoramic shots, though.  I got in my car and went back to Kakegawa for the castle.</p><div class='title'><b>11.

I finally found a city parking ramp a few blocks away.  I should've just parked at the museum, which was equally far, but found it a lot more sooner.</p><p>Kakegawa is basically a road stop between Tokyo and Nagoya.  The town is centered around the shinkansen station, which is where my hotel is.  The castle is about a kilometer north of the station.  There are plenty of gift shops, and restaurants around there, too.  It's a really nice area.</p><p>The castle towers over most of these stores, and is quite visible in this part of the town.  It's on top of a grassy hill.  And from the observation deck, you can see the entire town.  Also, on a clear day, you can view Mt. Fuji, too!  The castle is completely wooden, too. :)  It's very nice.</p><p>The admission for the ticket includes a walk through the palace resting near the base of the hill.  The museum is nearby, too, but you need to buy a combo ticket for entry.  The rally stamp was located in the palace, which took me a little while to find.</p><p>Kakegawa Castle was quite nice.  Great scenery, great castle, and lot's of places to visit within the castle courtyard.</p><div class='title'><b>10.

Hamamatsu is an actual metropolis style city.  Large and full of high-rises.  Huge streets, with lots of taxi cabs.  The city had plenty of people walking around.  There were many stores, and restaurants.  Almost no hints of economic depression.  It felt vibrant, and healthy.  The city felt big, but it probably wasn't all that big.</p><p>The castle was on the south end of a very large city park, near several hotels.  I could not find parking.  I eventually parked at the city pool which was near the park, but still took me about 15 minutes to walk to the castle.</p><p>The castle was another museum castle.  Lots of armor and weapons and stuff.  The view from the top wasn't all the great.  The large buildings of the city choked any view the castle had from back in the day.  Several building had tennis courts on the roof.  There were pools, and a few helicopter landing pads.</p><p>Meh, this castle was ok.  On to the next.</p><div class='title'><b>14.

The highway exit led straight the castle, and the parking lot was clearly marked and easily accessed from the road.  Simple.</p><p>Part of the castle was under construction, but the main building was ok.  Inside, the building was hosting part of an exhibit comparing swords in Manga and real life.  The rest of the exhibit was in the nearby museum.  It would've been nice if they offered an exhibition book for purchase.  Oh well…  maybe they did at the museum.</p><p>At the observation deck, you could view a lot of the city, most of which was free of any trees.  You could see the Okazaki station, and several trains entering and exiting.  Also, they had a fun activity upstairs where you could roll paint different colors on a small paper and recreate a woodblock painting.  Mine turned out ok.</p><p>Anyway, it was 1pm and I had 3 more castles to visit.  Nagoya was next, and it was over an hour away.</p><div class='title'><b>13.

The main parking ramp was completely full and there was a line of cards waiting for entry.  After waiting in line for about 10 minutes and not moving, I spotted some parking spots across the street.  Much easier.  I parked on the street, and walked back to the castle park.</p><p>There were having some kind of fair that day.  There was a bouncy castle, and plenty of beer booths.  There were several lines of people waiting to get their face painted, and take photos with samurai.  I walked towards the castle and took my photos.  I had already found the stamp at the entrance gate.</p><p>It was 2:30pm.  I had 2 hours to visit 2 more castles on my list.  Sure they were nearby, but I had no idea what other nonsense might stand in my way.  So, I turned around and left.  I think I'll come back to Nagoya Castle again, though.  Maybe I could visit it on the same day as Gifu Castle.</p><div class='title'><b>17.

There was some traffic, but I stuck with the most direct route.  The parking lot was easy to find, and there were plenty of spaces open.  The area seemed like it used to be some kind of theme park, but now only the castle stands in its place.</p><p>Kiyosu Castle was another museum style building, but it had a lot colorful exhibits showing off the clothing, tools, and daily life of the Japanese people just a few hundred years ago.  It was really nice. :)  It was definitely aimed at children.</p><p>From the top, you could watch skinkansen trails roll by, and see the downtown area in the distance.  The same downtown area I saw from the Inuyama Castle above.  Over all, it was a very nice museum.  It wasn't wooden, but it was quite unique from the standard cement and plaster buildings that simple shove relics into glass cases.

The hill is so large, you can see Komaki for several kilometers away.  It made it very easy to find.  Also, it's right next to an elevated highway, which makes it easy to get to.</p><p>I parked my car at 3:45pm, and was presented with a new challenge in order to complete my stamp rally card.  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3435.webp" >Check out this map!</a>  A maze of windy trails waited for me.  I guess fate thought I needed to earn my final stamp.  I made a quick mental image of where I needed to go, and started climbing the steps through the dense forest.  Actually, the denseness of the forest was surprising for something in the city.  Most city forests were planted and arranged.  This seemed like it was never touched from its original castle days.</p><p>I made my way through the trails in the forest, and finally reached the top.  It was another castle museum, but the view was absolutely brilliant.  You had a pure 360 degree view of all the northern neighborhoods and cities within Nagoya city.  You could see the downtown area, too.  It was an amazing reward for making it up the hill, and actually completing my Stamp Rally card.</p><p>After taking my photos, and getting back to my car, I went to Apita and bought some dinner.  Komaki seems like a really nice neighborhood.  There were lots of families in the department store.  Lots of young mothers randomly finding other families and starting conversations.  It felt like a community, rather than the eyes down, "buy my shit" normal behavior I've observed in most cities.</p><p>Komaki was a very nice end to a long journey.  Oh, but the journey isn't over yet.</p><div class='title'><b>Final</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3631.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3631.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3631.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3631.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3631.webp" /><br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3632.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3639.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Complete!  All 20 stamps, and plenty of brochures and ticket stubs.

The place is open until 7pm every day, so I could have done this last week.  Oh well.  I was somewhat near Gifu today, so I drove down to Ogaki to finally complete this saga.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3852.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3852.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3852.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3852.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3852.webp" /></p><p>I needed to go to the Ogaki Visitor Center located inside the Oku no Hosomichi Musubi no Chi Memorial Hall <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>奥の細道むすびの地記念館</span></span>.  This hall is basically a museum based on Matsuo Bashou, and his poetry collection "Oku no Hosomichi", which roughly translates as "The Narrow Road to the Deep North."  This memorial hall commemorates the final stop on his journey through the mountains, and the final chapter in his collection. </p><p>I arrived after that part of the building closed, though.</p><p>I walked over to the counter for the visitor counter, and gave them my sheet.  The two women went through the whole, "<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>すごい</span></span>！<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>お疲れ様でした</span></span>." spiel.</p><p>I didn't get many immediate rewards.  One of the women pulled out a non-discrete white plastic bag that contained 20 buttons.  Each button had a photo of the stamp rally castles, with the stamp rally title ovaled across the top.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3861.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3861.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3861.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140815_komaki_castle/IMG_3861.webp" /></p><p>She also grabbed a bottle of <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>おいしい大垣の水</span></span>, or 'delicious Ogaki water,' and shoved it in the bag.  If I had to guess the value of the items I received, I would say no more than $3.</p><p>Then I filled out an address form, and turned that in to the woman.  Apparently the ultimate prize will be mailed out later.  Or maybe I just signed up for a raffle, or something instead.  I mean, I guess if the prize is a bunch of food from around the Chubu area, mailing it all out at once makes sense to honor expiration dates.  The official end of this stamp rally isn't until November 30th, too.  So, if I do get something in the mail, it won't be until December. :(</p><p>Bleh.  This is kind of a lackluster end for the amount of time spent running around to all these castles.  I would say that it's the journey that counts more than the finale, but given that the sponsor of this stamp rally is Nexco, that's what they wanted everyone to do in the first place.</p><div class='title'><b>Stamp Rally Sponsor</b></div><p>It wasn't until I was planning that final road trip to collect 12 stamps in 2 days that I connected a few dots and discovered something sinister at work.</p><p>On the back of the stamp rally card is a convenient map that shows the locations of all 20 castles.  These castles are laid out with a map of the highway system, and each of the nearest exits on the highway are clearly marked.  "Aww, that's a nice touch.  That makes it easy to use the highway to get to these places," I thought.</p><p>Oh, but wait..  Nexco has their logos on the front and back of my rally card, which indicates that they're sponsoring this thing.  And Nexco is the company that owns, operates, and charges tolls for the highways in Japan.</p><p>Oh.  This isn't some rally to promote history and tourism through Japanese castles.  It's just an excuse to get people to use the highway system throughout Chubu and rake in the cash collected from the tollways.</p><p>All toll, I think I probably spent around 2<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>万円</span></span> ($200). Probably more..  So, congratulations to them, I suppose.  It makes sense that they would cheap out on a final prize.</p><div class='title'><b>Finish</b></div><p>Anyway, I'm still glad I went around to all these places, even though it ended up being a corporate trick.  Road trippin' in Japan is pretty fun.  The environments in Japan are so diverse that driving around to various places for almost 14 hours straight was quite fun.  It's way more fulfilling than sitting on a train or in an airplane.</p><p>I probably won't get a chance to drive anywhere far before the end of the year, but I definitely plan on taking more road trips in the future.  Perhaps north-bound.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Typhoon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/typhoon">Typhoon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The rainfall was apparently the heaviest Takayama has experienced in the last 10 years. The river behind my apartment grew over six feet high, nearly overflowing in some parts. In other areas of Takayama, the high levels and violent surge washed out the adjacent road.</p><p>Kiyomi was one of the most damaged neighborhoods. All the rain water rushes down the mountains, through neighborhoods of houses to collect in the Kamakami River. The rushing water often brings rocks and other debris with it, knocking away more rocks.
