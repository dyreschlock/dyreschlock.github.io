| August 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm sure I've seen Lost in Translation before today.  Lost in Translation is a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  It's about two people who aren't very happy, and then are subjected to culture shock to make it worse.  Through their culture shock and depression they meet each other. And bring each other out of it.</p><p>I could've sworn I've seen it before, but despite taking place in Japan and starring Bill Murray, it didn't make an impression on me.  Though in October 2003, I was in a different place.  Happy and in love.  Lost in Translation's heavy tones fell on my deaf ears.</p><div class='title'><b>Isolation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp"  /></p><p>When I find myself alone in Japan, there is always that looming sense of isolation.  I can ask questions and receive answers, but there is no one I can really engage in conversation.  All I have are my thoughts to bounce ideas off of.  I text, email or IM people back home, but the sound of my own voice becomes mute.  It becomes a treasure when I actually have another American (like myself) to talk to.  I thought Scarlett Johansson nailed that emotion perfectly when the film followed her around for a day.</p><p>Those scenes really are the perfect picture of a lone foreigner wandering about the daily lives of a population that is not their own.  For the most part, everyone just ignores the outsider.  Everyone is plugged into their lives, and have no business getting into others.  Children will sometimes break those boundaries, but that's only because they haven't been incorporated into society, yet.</p><p>Though, I've never experienced the agoraphobic culture shock to the point of incapacitation.  The only times it has taken anchor has been when I've truly been alone in Japan.  But, I just throw those emotions away.  My time in Japan has always been short and limited.  It would be a waste to be stuck in a tiny hotel room.</p><div class='title'><b>Language</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp"  /></p><p>Obviously, I identify far more with Scarlett Johansson's character's silent brooding wonderment, than Bill Murray's case.  Though when I'm in Japan, it's for absolutely no purpose than to wander around and look at things.  If I were there on business, as is Bill Murray's character, my culture shock probably wouldn't be as agoraphobic.  His culture shock is in the language and miss-communication.  I don't have much trouble in that department.</p><p>The scene where Bill Murray is waiting in the hospital talking with the granny is a conversation I've had many times in Japan. ^_^  Japanese people will always try to dumb down their language to what they think is simple for you, but is often what makes them even more difficult to understand.  I know sentence structure, noun forms, and what is being said, I just can't translate some of the words because my vocabulary is horrible.  Maybe I just need to ask, "What is this word?"</p><p>Though, a lot of the Japanese dialogue in the film is pretty easy to understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Moments</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp"  /></p><p>Lost in Translation ends in the same manor many moments end in Japan.  A moment is that is truly final.  A moment that can only take place in a single moment of your life and one that can never be relived.  A "Goodbye" that is goodbye forever.</p><p>Charolette and Bob Harris depart under these terms and embrace with the knowledge they will never see each other again.  Because time in Japan always comes with an expiration date.  And when it expires, that is it.  The end.  And that is where the film ends.</p><div class='title'><b>Epilogue, aka Reverse Culture Shock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp"  /></p><p>In real life, most of these moments are final, but that is not the end of the story.  The epilogue is returning to life before Japan.  Taken away from isolation and plugged back in familiarity and understanding.  For some people this is a breath of fresh air.  People to finally talk to!  People who understand me!  For me, I cherish the isolation.</p><p>Nothing bothers me in Japan.  People keep to themselves and are polite to each other.  Store clerks say thank you and go out of their way to ensure your satisfaction.  Being a foreigner, I'm a guest in their country and they treat me as such.</p><p>Back in America, Life sucks.  Everyone is unhappy because they HAVE to work today.  A single customer asking a single request is WAY TOO GODDAMN much of a hassle.  People think too much of themselves rather than the company they represent.  They think of the company paying them for their services, rather than them earning their pay for giving their services.</p><p>Everything in life returns to the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary.  Here's what I thought when I first got back after those 3.5 months studying abroad: <a href="/old/v7/home" title="/home">December 29th, 2006</a>.</p><p>Showing this side of being in Japan would have truly ruined Lost in Translation.</p><div class='title'><b>Passion!</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost in Translation fell on deaf ears because I didn't know anything about this.  I never had these moments.  I never experienced such isolation.  I never had to talk through a language barrier.  All these points resonate beautifully in the film.  So much so that I can never watch it again.  Unless it's with my friends from the Fall 2006 Class of Nagasaki Gaigokugo Daigaku.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tokyo Tower" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower">Tokyo Tower</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm totally excited, but the day's traveling has worn that down a little bit.  It's not until my batteries are fully recharged that my energy empowers my excitement.  That first morning back in Japan is like Christmas as a Child.</p><p>I want to do everything!  And my first destination was Tokyo Tower, which is its own symbol of regeneration.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp"  /></p><p>After World War II, Japan was a defeated nation.  They were down, but not out.  Everyone in the nation pulled together to rebuild Japan.  Japan flourished once again.</p><p>In 1953, NHK began broadcasting for the first time.  But the signal was too weak for the entire Kanto region to receive its signals.  It was clear that a large transmission tower would be needed to boost the signal, or else moderately sized ones would choke Tokyo.</p><p>They called upon Tachu Naito to architect such a tower.  He chose the France's Eiffel Tower as a starting point, and designed a structure so secure that it could withstand an Earthquake twice the strength of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake (8.3 on the Richter Scale) and typhoons with wind speeds up to 140 miles an hour.</p><p>When completed it stood 30 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower.  It became a symbol for Japan.  A monument to their efforts to rebuild Japan and their growing economic power.</p><p>Thank you, Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp"  /></p><p>Tokyo Tower has 2 observatory decks.

| May 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>This story begins on eBay.</b></div><p>Since October last year, I've begun selling a lot of my collectibles because I really haven't gotten anything out them.  I bought a whole lot of figures from McFarlane toys, and they've done nothing but sit in my parent's attic for nearly 10 years.  So, I put them on ebay.  Some of them sold quite fast, but others lingered for quite a long time.</p><p>Fast forward to March this year.  I've already purchased airfare for the first couple days in May to visit Tokyo, Japan.  I get an email from an ebay user wondering if I'd ship something of mine to Tokyo.  The light bulb immediately flashes in my head, and I start writing the reply,</p><p>"Yeah, I could ship to Tokyo but it'll be about $30 or $40 extra.  As it so happens, I'll be in Tokyo at the beginning of May.  If you wouldn't mind waiting 2 months, I could deliver the figure in person free of charge. ^_^  What do you say?"</p><p>Initially, the user was taken back by this.  "What?  I don't even know you," his first reply began with.  But once I proved the depths of my Anime nerdom, he agreed to meet.  He introduced himself as Akira. ^_^  I asked him for suggestions of places I should visit while in Japan and he mentioned to Ghibli Museum.  There's a Ghibli Museum?!  Damn straight I'm going there.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning a trip to the Ghibli Museum</b></div><p>Thankfully, Akira mentioned that buying tickets for the Ghibli Museum is not straightforward.  You can't buy the tickets at the Museum.  In Japan, you must buy tickets at a Lawsons convenience store.  The ticket is for a specific day with entrance at a specific time of that day.  For non-Japanese residents, you must buy your tickets through JTB Travel Agency.</p><p>We choose a day, May 3rd, and bought our tickets without a problem.  Our tickets were for 2pm, so we planned to meet up ahead of time.  We could go to Shinjuku or wherever and hang out.  Eventually, we'll make our way down to Mitaka Station and take the bus to the Ghibli Museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Hanging Out before hand</b></div><p>Thank god for my Japanese Cell Phone.  There's no way we would've found each other had he not been able to call me and talk.  We met in near the East entrance of Shinjuku Station.  And we just walked around to various stores and arcades in the area,  chatted about Anime and Games.  What I liked, What he liked.  General bullshit like that.</p><p>We hopped on a train and went over to Nakano to visit the very first Mandarake store.  The Nakano Mandarake was absolutely massive.  It was 3 floors with each floor was about the size of a mall.  This Mandarake was segmented into many different stores that specialized in each tiny niche of otaku fandom.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" /></p><p>There was a store for costumes, one for retro games, one for newer game, one for new games, artbooks, design books, animation cells, figures, statues, gashapon, old music, game music, foreign music, anime, movies, foreign movies...  the list goes on and on.  This is where I found Ikaruga Used for $36.  I also found a few <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp">copies</a> of <a

Mandarake is also where I found more Super Mario Bros. sound drops.</p><p>As time crept closer to 2pm, we left Mandarake, hopped on a train and headed for Mitaka.  We got to the Museum right on time and met up with Akira's wife, Natsuki, outside. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Museum</b></div><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" /></p><p>The Ghibli Museum was very rustic and homely. ^_^  Nested snug in a heavily wooded park, the organic domes and vine covered walls made a perfect home.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, taking pictures inside the Museum was not allowed.  But, the museum was very nice.  Each part of the museum was a separate room that you'd enter from the center of the building.  The first room had animated statues of Ghilbi characters that displayed how the animation process works.</p><p>Also on the first floor, was a theater that played an original production only available to see at the Museum.  They have 6 or 7 different original 15-minute films that rotate month after month.  For May, they were playing "Mei to Koneko Bus" (english: "Mei and the Koneko Bus").  Which featured Mei from Totoro who captured a Kitty Bus, and then go off in the woods with it and meets a bunch of Totoros.  It was really cute. ^_^</p><p>After the film, we went on the roof to see the Laputa Garden.  When reaching the roof, you're immediately greeted by a Laputa Giant.  Akira and I stood next to it for a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" /></p><p>The path continued along the back to reveal a Laputa stone.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" /></p><p>There were other spiffy areas in the museum, too.  Like a life-sized Cat Bus for the kids to hop around on.  There was also an area that served as a replica to Miyazaki's workbench from when he began Ghibli films.  All along the walls were original sketches and storyboards for his works throughout the years.</p><p>There was the gift shop too!  I bought a design book that has many storyboards from Ghibli films throughout the years.  I bought some stickers for my suitcase.  And, I bought some other things to give as gifts for people. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Afterwards..</b></div><p>After leaving the Ghibli Museum, we walked through the park towards the Kichijoji train station.  Mitaka is a beatiful area.  Perfect for letting children run around outside in a nice wooded area, rather than the cool concrete of the Tokyo streets.  Before we parted ways, we went to Dinner at a Sushi restaurant underneath Kichijoji station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" /></p><p>This was one of those Sushi restaurant that had a conveyer belt running through the restaurant.  When something came by your table that looked delicious you'd take it from the line and it's yours!  The color and design of the plate designated the price you'd pay for eating it.  Prices ranged from 75 cents a plate to $6.  My favorite sushi were in the $1.50, $2 range, so I was fine. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" /></p><p>They had the best California Rolls I've ever eaten.  The avacado was crisp and cool, next to the tender soft crab meat wrapped around delicious rice topped with some mayonaise and tuna eggs.  (at least, I think those are tuna eggs.)</p><p>Delicious!  But I still prefer 100 yen Sushi in Nagasaki. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Bon Voyage..</b></div><p>Meeting Akira and Natsuki was amazing and definitely the highlight of my trip.  The Language difference wasn't too great.  They were much better at English than I was at Japanese.  But we were able to go back and forth between the 2 to figure out what we were trying to say.  Hopefully, my Japanese will be better next time I'm in Tokyo so we can have better conversations!</p><p>If you buy or sell stuff on ebay, I think it's definitely worth your while to meet up with people if you have the chance.  Whatever you're buying or selling is a great place to start a conversation.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Akihabara isn't that exciting" rel="bookmark"

| May 28, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Though, I'm pretty sure I didn't go to the right places..</p><p>Akihabara was one of the top places on my itinerary for Tokyo.  Worldwide, it is known as THE hub for Anime, Video Games and all things electronic.  Almost every store sold new and used video games, music, movies, anime, electronics, toys, and just about anything geeks like us would buy.  You'd think it'd be heaven, right?</p><p>Yeah, it's great if you're trying to find something relatively new.  But searching for rare or uncommon video games is pointless.  I visited about 30 game stores along Chuodori and in the alleyways around there and each store had the same problem..  Overexposure.</p><p>So many goddamn people visit Akihabara that any amount of selection had already been picked over by thousands of people that day.  Every store I visited had wall-to-wall people.  I could hardly even more through the aisles, let alone, stay in one place long enough to actually give an exhaustive search.</p><p>Also, because of the centralized location and massive worldwide acclaim of the area, real estate is tight.  Every store is smaller than your average Mall Gamestop and holds about 3 times the product.  Most stores do have multiple floors though, but they generally keep games to one floor, Anime to another floor, and buy counters to another.</p><p class='img'><b>Yodobashi</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3349.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3349.webp" /></p><p>My first location was Akihabara's Yodobashi Camera.  Yodobashi is THE premiere electronic department store in Japan.  I can't really think of a good analogy..  It's kinda like the FAO Shwartz of electronics?  Except not snobby.  Their Gashapon Aisles were impressive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3346.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3346.webp" /></p><p>I bought a couple toys for Jess Roqs, but that's about it.  The toy section was kinda boring and expensive.  So was their game section.  Their game section did have a neat little diorama for Gyakuten Kenji, which was released TODAY in Japan.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3348.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3348.webp" /></p><p>Ultimately, I left this massive building unsatisfied...</p><p class='img'><b>Gamers</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3362.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3362.webp" /></p><p>Exiting Akiba station and heading west to Chuodori, the first major store you see is Gamers (pictured above from across the street.)  As I stood cramped in a boring corner of Gamers waiting for someone to move so I could stop looking at the N64 games, I said to myself, "ya know, if there were an earthquake, not a single person in this building would exit alive."  Maybe it's not so cramped for Japanese people.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3353.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3353.webp" /></p><p>It was pretty cramped for Japanese girls dressed up in gigantic mascot uniforms, though.  She had to shove her way through everyone just to get to the back of the store.</p><p>Games did have a poster for Evangelion 2.0 in one of its stairwells.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3351.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3351.webp" /></p><p>Besides that, I didn't find anything great inside of Gamers.  Well... I suppose I did find a first print copy of Riz-Zoawd on DS that was packaged with the OST.  Riz-Zoawd is a Japanese RPG based on The Wizard of Oz that uses the Stylus in some weird way.  It's developed by Media Creations (creators of Wild Arms). It looked really interesting.  But I figured that I'd never play it, so I passed.</p><p class='img'><b>Wandering Around</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" /></p><p>Like I mentioned before, Akihabara was fricken packed.  The day I visited was Greenery Day (a national holiday), so that may have been another reason for the crowds.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" /></p><p>Isn't selling the R4 card illegal in Japan?  Note that the sign states that the R4 card does not work with the recently released DSi.  Only works for DS Lite.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" /></p><p>One of the buildings had some girls singing a concert.  It was just a bunch of J-Poppy songs, so I didn't stick around for very long.</p><p class='img'><b>Super Potato</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" /></p><p>When talking about Japanese retro games, Jeremy Parish, Chris Kohler, and other <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/my1up?publicUserId=5655917" title="http://www.1up.com/do/my1up?publicUserId=5655917">retronauts</a> always seem to mention their favorite Japanese game store: Super Potato.  So, I made a point to find this place and take a gander.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" /></p><p>Super Potato has 3 floors to its own.  All the merchandise is crammed into floors 3 and 4.  Translating: The 3rd floor has Famicon, Megadrive, Super Famicon, 3DO, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, and NeoGeo games.  The 4th floor has Playstation, Gameboy, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Xbox, Game Watch, Game Music, LSI? and something else.  The 5th floor is their retro arcade.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3368.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3368.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3368.webp" /></p><p>Their selection was quite vast, but they didn't have any decent Dreamcast games :/.  Oh well, Super Potato prides itself on Famicon and Super Famicon games.</p><div class='title'><b>Mandarake</b></div><p>My final point of interest was Mandarake.  Every piece of merchandise in Mandarake was purchased from actual people.  They have no distribution lines of merchandise, no regular products.  Hundreds of people line up every day to sell their crap to Mandarake, and Mandarake puts a price tag on it.  And it doesn't have to be an official product either.</p><p>Mandarake is particularly notable for carrying Doujinshi, which are self-published works.  Most of which are Manga, and ALSO most of which are either Yaoi (which is guy on guy action specifically catering towards a female audience) or straight-up Hentai (anime pornography) of popular anime/game characters.</p><p>I've found some fantastic things at the Fukuoka and Nakano Mandarake branches, but the Akihabara branch suffered the same problems as all the other stores in Akiba.  It was very cramped and had poor selection.  Though, they did have Cosmic Smash on Dreamcast for $46.  They also had a copy of Border-down on Dreamcast for $96, which is the cheapest I've found it for...  I didn't buy either.</p><div class='title'><b>That's it</b></div><p>Unfortunately, that was really all that I visited.  I probably should have visited the Anime Radio station and the Akihabara UDX, but I was getting very discouraged on my hunt for video games.  The only thing I bought in Akihabara were a couple of Capsule Toys and Doki Doki Majo Shinpan.  Every store I visited was just another dead end search for spiffy games.</p><p>Overexposure definitely makes Akihabara horrible for game shopping.  If you want to find great games, you need to find the friendly neighborhood game stores that only the locals go to.  As I <a href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition" title="/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition">mentioned yesterday</a>, that Geo North West of Shinjuku was amazing.  I found Ketsui and Project Justice for quite a cheap price.</p><p>In fact, I came across a couple dudes sifting through Playstation games and writing down prices on this very intricate printed out spread sheet.  Pricing and searching for games in Akihabara is pointless.  Be prepared to do a little more traveling if you actually want to make money buying Japanese games and putting them on ebay.  I've come across full boxed copies of Chrono Trigger and Seiken Densetsu 2 for as little as $5 in places you wouldn't think to look.</p><p>Anyways, the Over-hyped popularity of Akihabara is what disappointed me.  There are better places in Tokyo for this kind of stuff.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: Tokyo Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition">Games I buy: Tokyo Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 27, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While in Tokyo, Japan, I spent some time shopping for games, which is something I generally do whenever I'm in a new area.  Whether I'm returning home to Minneapolis, visiting my friend in Tampa, Florida, or flying overseas to Japan, I'll find the locations of the Used game stores and try to visit each one.</p><p>I'm not searching for anything in Particular.  I generally browse their selection and check prices for all of their stock.  Occasionally, I'll come across a game or a price that sets off some alarm bells in my head.  "Wow, they have a copy of Dragon Force on Saturn.  Sweet."..  "Holy crap, Psychonauts on PS2 for $20?!"</p><p>While I'm still in the US, I'll pull out my cellphone and check the price against what is listed on Half.com.  If there's more than a $15 gap in favor of the game I found, I'll buy it and list it on Half.com when I get home.  But, if it's a game I'd be interested in playing sometime in the future, I'll probably buy it anyways.</p><p>These days, I haven't bought a whole lot of new games because I have almost everything I want.  Or I feel that I have too much and should stop buying games.</p><p>That's not the case in Japan.  In Japan, used games for retro consoles are pretty cheap, so when I come across a game with Gem-like qualities, I'll buy it.  And such is the case with every game on this list, except this first one.</p><p class='img'><b>PS3/Bluray - Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete</b> 1st Edition<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" /></p><p>Though, Advent Children Complete really isn't a game.  The 1st Edition release contained the demo for Final Fantasy XIII on PS3.  I decided to buy it because Square has no plans to release a disc version of the demo in North America.  And the Advent Children Complete film is entirely in english.  Or, at least, subtitled.</p><p>I figured the "1st Edition" might be difficult to come by since it's a first edition.  But, Square saw fit to produce nearly 2 million first editions of this set, so this product was everywhere.  Every store I went to had copies of Advent Children Complete.  Most used stores even had it.  In fact, Yamada Lavi in Shibuya, which is where I bought it, actually had their copies discounted to around $52.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - English of the Dead</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" /></p><p>While browsing game stores in Shinjuku, I came across English of the Dead for the DS at a Softmap.  I was instantly entranced by the sheer concept and the throwback to Typing of the Dead for Dreamcast.  It's basically the same game!  Instead of typing out words to kill zombies, you translate Kanji into English.  What a perfect vehicle to learn more Kanji!  Instant Purchase.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" /></p><p>I found this game at a Trader located in Akihabara for a mere $20!  For those who don't know, the Doki Doki Majo Shinpan is a dating sim sort of game where you must determine whether or not underaged school girls are witches.  In order to make that determination you must touch and grope these girls with the DS Stylus.  Take a look at this video for a demonstration: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw</a></p><p>The first Doki Doki Majo Shinpan was release in 2007 and prompted much internet humor.  In 2008, SNK released this follow-up that was rated even higher on their Adult-content scale.</p><p>Anyways, $20 is pretty cheap for one of the more bizarre Japanese DS releases.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Ketsui Death Label</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3665.webp" /></p><p>This is one of the rarest DS games to date.  Ketsui is a "bullet-hell" shooter made by Cave.  It was released in limited run and contained a DVD with video of professionals running through the game perfectly.  I found Ketsu when I started doing my serious game hunting during my trip.  It was only $46 at Geo in North West Shinjuku.  $46 is an excellent price considering it goes for 2 to 3 times that on ebay.</p><p class='img'><b>Dreamcast -

You talk about whatever you want, buy drinks, buy food.</p><p>You can do this in the game Yakuza, too. In fact, in Yakuza 2, you can go to Hostess Clubs, you can run a Hostess Club, and you can also BE a hostess in a hostess club.

It's pretty interesting to see the similarities and differences depicted in the game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Getting to Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/getting-to-japan">Getting to Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm a pretty lazy person.  I've had 2 months since I purchased airline tickets for Japan, but I still waited until the night before to do everything.  On Wednesday Night, I bought better insoles for my shoes, packed clothing, packed other stuff, paid rent, processed all my old photos still on my camera, watched Rescue Me.  I could have easily done this stuff on Tuesday, but decided to wait for I don't know why.</p><p>As such I got to bed around Midnight.  I wanted to get a good night's rest before my 8am flight, but It was not in the cards.  I had to wake up around 5:15am and get outside to catch a bus at 5:52 to head to the airport.  A transfer here, a transfer there, and I was at the airport.  A timely arrival didn't really matter though, since Chicago thunderstorms delayed my flight out of Madison about 2 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>O'hare</b></div><p>Eventually, I made it to Chicago with well enough time to catch my Narita flight.  So much time, in fact, that I walked around the airport.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3119.webp" /></p><p>O'hare has some very pretty areas that I hadn't seen before.  Usually what I see of O'hare is construction, or concrete walls.  The International flight areas is really pretty.  The corridor connecting Terminals B and C is underground and has rainbow lights that flicker along to classical music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3111.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3118.webp" /></p><p>Going back and forth along the conveyer belts took up enough of my free time.  I boarded the plane, sat in my seat, and off we went to Narita.  I choose the very last window seat on the left side of the plane: 61B.  Which was great in theory.  There was no one behind me to kick my seat!  However, directly behind me was a semi-open area for people to stand and stretch.  So I only slept a couple times, and 20 minutes at time for that matter.</p><p>The pilot was pretty efficient.  We got to Narita 20 minutes ahead of schedule!  However, that didn't make any difference.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita</b></div><p>The Japanese Health Administration was set into Panic mode thanks to the Swine Flu and EVERY incoming human to Japan had to be "Quarantined".  We sat on the plane for an additional 2 hours after our 12 hour flight for Health officials to board the plane and have us take an additional customs survey about our health.</p><p>One-by-one passenger-by-passenger they would receive our survey process it and then decide that we're OK.</p><p class='img'><img

ridiculousness.  Everyone sat in their seat and waited.  I was probably the only one on the plane that didn't have a connecting flight, too.  We arrived at Narita around 2:20pm and I finally got off the plane around 4:15pm.  It's been about 21 hours since I've got any actual sleep.</p><div class='title'><b>Shibuya</b></div><p>The Narita Express took me directly to Shibuya where I plan on staying for my whole trip.  The second that I got off the train I started walking in the direction I thought was correct but was not.  I joked that I was totally get lost walking around Tokyo, but I didn't think I would get lost so early in my Journey.  Once I found a city map, I was turned toward the right direction.</p><p>The Hotel I planned on staying at was actually a Love Hotel.  I guess that's what I get for last minute research.  There was an actual hotel right around the corner though.  So I checked in, got in my room and finally went to sleep around 7:30pm (24 hours since I woke up at 5:15am in Madison).<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The rest of the trip" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-rest-of-the-trip">The rest of the

There was quite a bit that had changed downtown I wasn't really expecting.  For example, the You-Ing, which used to be on the corner downtown had moved into the prime 6 floor location of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0474.webp">Hamanomachi</a>.  It looked like the whole downtown area right outside Hamanomachi was going through some huge changes, too.  It'll probably look completely different in another year.</p><p>As luck would have it, it was Thursday, April 10th, which meant Mario Kart Wii had just come out. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0475.webp" /></p><p>You-Ing had far more than just those copies and I bet they were completely sold out by Saturday.</p><p>Another big change was that the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp">Sega World</a> was no longer in business.  It don't know how they could've gone out of business, when the place was packed everytime I went there.  There was no sign on the door saying the moved locations either.  Weird...</p><div class='title'><b>More shopping and arcades</b></div><p>After taking a look at some of the other arcades and a couple more stores, we made our way to You-Me Saito and Amu Plaza and tried our luck, unsuccessfully, at some crane games.  Later on, we made it to Taito and found a new Konami Shmup!  It's called Otomedius, another parody spin-off of the Gradius series.  Here's a few pics of the machine (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0480.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0480.webp">here</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0481.webp">here</a>).  The screen was very high-res and featured a couple touch options too.  There was a dude playing it though, and those crane games were a little more appealing for the moment, so I didn't play it.  It looked like it played A LOT like parodius though.</p><p>It looked like it could've been fun though...  I'll look it up on wikipedia later.</p><div class='title'><b>Beardo</b></div><p>For the rest of the evening, we returned to Beardo to hang out with Sachi, Yoriko and Nonoka. ^_^.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0482.webp" /></p><p>And we also proceeded to drink heavily.  Throughout the night, several of the newly initiated JASIN students arrived and we got a chance to talk to them about Japan.  It was really kinda weird though..  It's like watching a new Season of Survivor with a completely new cast of people, when you're totally used to the previous season.</p><p>Kraig Henry showed up again, and began giving the students the run down, more or less.  The students that hung out with us were from New York state, Southern Illinois, La Crosse, WI, Manchester, England, North North England, and France.</p><p>As the night grew thin, we started passing out and had to return to our beds.  We said goodbye to everyone for the evening, but we met up with the Hiro family the next day for lunch. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Friday</b></div><p>For lunch, we went to one of those restaurants on 5th floor Amu.  After lunch, we lost track of time a little bit, and had to run to catch our train back to Fukuoka.  Gage and I ran down to the ticket counter and bought our tickets, while Sachi and Yoriko made it downstairs with Nonoka and Nanase.  The bought some local tickets, so they could say goodbye to us on the platform.  We hopped on the train, and waved goodbye to them just outside as the doors closed.  I sat down in a window seat where they could see me, and continued waving to them.  They even started running after the train a little bit when it took off, it was so sweet ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b>Fukuoka</b></div><p>Early in the day, while waiting for Sachi, I emailed Aya since I knew she lived around Fukuoka and made some plans to hang out with her for the rest of the evening.  She actually lived a little further away than I thought she did, but it was still considered in Fukuoka, which was weird.  Her train ride was about an hour to get downtown, whereas our train ride from Nagasaki was about 1 hour 45 minutes.</p><p>Anywho, we finally met up with her and went over to Tenjin to do some more shopping and arcading.

Gage wrote up a couple of emails and I watched some TV.  There was a very interesting program on which started off talking about Otaku and Akihabara but blended into Russian-Japanese fandom.  This Japanese otaku flew to Russia and met up with his friend for a tour of this fandom.  They started off with "Bloom", which is some big Russian Cosplay organization, i think?</p><p>They also went around to several Japanese restaurants.  The first of which was a sushi place called Yakitori.  The otaku thought it was odd that the place didn't even have any Yakitori, yet that's what they named the place.  The sushi chef was a roll with very creamy cream cheese, some green onions and some kind of fish that looked like tuna.  The otaku was rather stunned at the cream cheese addition, but was full-out surprised when after the sushi roll was rolled, they deep-fried it in Tempura.  It looked really really good actually, but not to the Japanese.  It looked like he was just being polite when he said "oishii".</p><p>They didn't go into as much detail with other restaurants than to simple make fun of their names.  One restaurant had some kanji on the sign which was missing a stroke.  This really seemed like the exact same "making fun of" us Americans do when we see/read Engrish shirts.  It was always wondering if the Japanese had something similar to that and I guess they do. ^_^  The same type of thing was we quite tattoos with some kanji.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita</b></div><p>The morning came quite fast, and we darted from bed into a cab and then into the airplane.  We had a 7 hour lay-over in Narita and since our luggage was already loaded onto our next flight, we did a little exploring to Narita.  As luck would have it, we picked a damn good Saturday to be flying out of Narita.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080412_naritasan/IMG_0504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080412_naritasan/IMG_0504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080412_naritasan/IMG_0504.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080412_naritasan/IMG_0506.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080412_naritasan/IMG_0506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080412_naritasan/IMG_0506.webp" /></p><p>Narita-san, the local buddhist temple, was celebrating it's 1070th birthday.
