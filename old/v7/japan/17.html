This year is a little different, though.  When I arrived last year, it seemed like it snowed every single day.  Sometimes it snowed just a little bit.  Other days, it would snow all day long.</p><p>This year, there's been a few days where it seemed like the snow would never stop.  On Valentine's day this year, it snowed continuously for a day and a half.  I went outside a few times to shovel snow away from my car and parking space.</p><p>Also, snow in Takayama is a little different than it is in Wisconsin.  Takayama is completely surrounded by mountains.  They are an excellent deterrent for the wind.  When it snows, the snowflakes glide straight down to the ground and fall flat.  It's very peaceful, and beautiful, unlike Wisconsin.  While snow is still beautiful in Wisconsin, there's no natural barrier for the wind, so when it snows, the wind shoves it into your face.  The wind freezes the roads, and basically ruins everything.</p><p>When it snows in Takayama, it's like living in a snow globe.</p><p>On this Friday, I went to my Japanese class, and took some pictures along the way.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3444.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3504.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3512.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3512.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3512.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon">Takaoka Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 18, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When I came to Japan to work, I had 3 goals for the year.  One of which was to run in a half marathon over here, and today I finally accomplished that goal.  Some of the teachers I work with at an elementary school in town signed up to run in the Takaoka marathon.  Takaoka is a suburb of Toyama city about an hour and a half north of Takayama by highway.  Toyama has a population of about 425,000 people, so it's a bit bigger than Takayama.  Also, Toyama is right on the Sea of Japan, and not in the mountains, so it's about 10 degrees more warm.</p><p>The start time for the Half Marathon was 9am.  We left Takayama around 6:30am, just to make sure we'd get there with enough time.  We arrived around 8am, and didn't really have a whole lot to do for an hour.  Packet PIck-up was only available the morning of, so we collected our T-Shirts, bibs, race booklet, and what not.  This event was hosted by the University of Takaoka, so there weren't any merchandise tents, or similar things.  </p><p>It was a very academic and non-commercial event.  And many of the runners that showed up, seemed like professional athletes.  Way different than the marathons I've run before.  In the US, the marathons are an excuse for people to get into shape, and do their best.  It gives people a reason to exercise, and see if they can actually accomplish the feat of covering 13 miles by only using your legs.</p><p>The Takaoka marathon seemed like it was more of a contest for athletes.  There were several elderly people there, who weren't viewing this as a race, but many of the other runners were pretty serious.  Out of the 672 Half marathon participants, it didn't seem like many were just there for exercise and for fun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" /></p><p>I put on my headphones, and began listening to Underworld as the starting horn fired.  The first 1 or 2 kilometers of this race were terrible.  At the start of any marathon, the route is completed congested, so you need to give a wide area for everyone to move around each other.  Let the fast glide through the crowd, so they don't ruin their pace.</p><p>The start of the race went around the race track, down the hill, and then around another race track so the entire course could fit the 21.1 kilometers of a half marathon.  Ugh?  They should really add the course stretching segments towards the middle of the race.</p><p>After getting away from the beginning, the whole course was really rather nice.  The course took us up to the beach of the Sea of Japan, then back through the country-side a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp"/></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp"/></p><p>Before running the race, I knew their was a time limit.  You had to finish under 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I was running around the 15 kilometer when I started actually thinking about this and doing the math in my head.  "Let's see..  150 divided by 20 is 7.5.  7 times 21 is 147.. " I was running at about 7 minutes per km, so I figured I was in good shape to finish.  But, I really had no idea what would happen if I didn't make the 2:30.</p><p>Well, at 17.4km, I came face-to-face with what happens.  You're forced to retire.  At the 17.4 km mark, there was a 2 hour checkpoint, which I arrived at 2 hours 1 minute and 49 seconds.  I guess 7 minutes per km wasn't fast enough.  I arrived, and the dude said, it's finished.  A few more people behind me caught up, and were also stopped.  Bahh..</p><p>A few minutes later, the bus of shame showed up and we all got inside.  Something I didn't realize at the time was I had already passed the 1 hour 30 minute checkout a few kilometers back at 12.7km.  I mean, I saw the clock and everything, but I didn't realize that was a "do or die" checkpoint.  I made it there around 1:27 or 1:28.</p><p>The bus of shame had about 20 people.  The bus drove us back to the start on the rest of the course.  We easily caught up to the last 2 people who made it through the 2 hour check mark, and they were just walking the whole way back.  Pfftt, what kind of bullshit is that.  I was going at a faster pace than these guys were.  I could have easily made the 2:30 finish line.  Bahh..</p><p>I had to turn in my bib, rather than be able to keep it.  Whatever.</p><p>I suppose this is why there were so many athletes present, rather than casual marathon runners.  But, at least I now know what I'm getting into for these marathons in Japan.  It seems that they all have a time limit, and they do clearly mark all the checkpoints on the website, and in the information packet.</p><p>So, while I completed my goal of running in a marathon in Japan, it feels rather disappointing since I didn't finish.  Well, for 2014, I definitely plan on running again, and actually completing one!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okura Waterfall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okura-waterfall">Okura Waterfall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's about a 15 minute drive whether it's by highway, or by country roads.  Kiyomi is a very narrow village.  The Seseragi Road travels the entire length of the village from it's most southern point to the center of the town in the northwest.  Another road goes directly east from there covering the rest of the village.  It's about an hours drive to cover all of Seseragi, but it shows just how stunning beautiful the nature of the Japanese mountains can be.  </p><p>I recently did a report about Kiyomi.  There's about 3000 residents.  The main industry of Kiyomi is farming, of which most are dairy farmers.  Turns out there are actually more cows in Kiyomi than people.  There's more than 5000 registered cows.</p><p>98% of Kiyomi is heavily wooded and mountainous terrain.  As their website states, Kiyomi is mostly wilderness, and everything else is inhabited by close and loving families of farmers.  Any random person you talk with in Kiyomi will mention how great Kiyomi is for being with family.</p><p>But, in that 98% wilderness, there are some beautiful hiking trails, camp grounds, and waterfalls, too.  In November, it still hadn't snowed yet.  It was still too warm.  On this rainy day, I went to visit one of the more popular and easily accessible waterfalls of Kiyomi, the Okura waterfall.</p><p>It's about an hours hike from Seseragi up the mountain to where the Okura waterfall has its largest cliff.  Throughout the hike, you follow the stream of water it produces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_2986.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3021.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3024.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3048.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3054.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3055.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131110_okura/IMG_3058.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to September Rain" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/september-rain">September Rain</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 20, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I teach in Takayama City in the Gifu prefecture of Japan.  Like many places, Takayama has many unique qualities that set it apart from other areas in Japan.  One of these unique qualities is that Takayama is the largest city in Japan by area.  It is 2178 km<superscript>2</superscript>, which is the size of most counties in Wisconsin.</p><p>It was only recently that this happened, too.  In 2005, there was some government restructuring, and several neighboring villages became under the Takayama Municipality.  These are the villages of Shokawa, Kiyomi, Kokofu, Nyukawa, Miya, Kuguno, Asahi, Kamitakara, and Takane.  Their government offices became branches of Takayama, and Takayama's government now ran these towns, too.  Or something like that.</p><p>Despite having such a large land area, there's only 92,000 some people living here.  And only 60,000 or 70,000 people in the central Takayama city.  The outer lands of Takayama have a lot of mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods in the valleys connected by narrow winding roads.  The most distant and ill-populated of which is Takane.</p><p>Even at the time of the merge, Takane didn't even have 1000 residents.  Wikipedia says they had 780 in 2003.  But, they were still their own municipality, complete with its very own Elementary and Junior High schools.  At least they did until 2007.  2 years after the Takayama merge, with such few students, they closed those schools down.  And the school children of Takane now take a bus to the next village over, Asahi.</p><p>Over the summer, I wanted to visit Takane, and see what this forest oasis looked like, and I went with new ALT Simona who had just arrived in Japan 2 weeks prior.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" /></p><p>And this is basically it.  After driving through some thick forests, and windy mountain roads, there are a few houses, a couple of buildings, and then the forests open up a little bit, and you're greeting with the post office.  Takane is a very vertical village.  The residents shaved off a side of the one of mountains, and set up town.  There's a ryokan, city hall, the post office, several houses, rice fields, and a few apartment buildings.  But, there's really no commerce at all.  No convenience store.  Not even a grocery store.  I think there was a liquor store, though.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" /></p><p>This place reminds me of LOST.</p><p>Most of the traffic through the town are logging trucks heading up river to the logging camps past the massive dams.</p><div class='title'><b>Takane JHS / <span class='ja'>高根中</span></b></div><p>Tucked away on the ends of the town were the former schools.  Takane JHS was near the center of the town.  Anyone living in town could easily walk there.  It's on the other side of the valley, and mostly visible from the town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" /></p><p>Most of the school was abandoned and no longer cared for.  The foot lockers in the entrance way were all torn up.  And the inside of the gym was dirty and probably hadn't been visited in over a year.  Out back was the incinerator, and changing rooms which had plenty of rust and wood damage.</p><p>Though, right next to the gym was a "gate ball" arena, so the elderly people in town were still coming up here on a regular basis.  (Gate ball is very similar to croquet)</p><div class='title'><b>Takane ES / <span class='ja'>高根小</span></b></div><p>On the way into and out of town is Takane ES.  Unlike the Junior High, this building still showed plenty signs of use.  Looking in the windows, we could clearly see that the Home Ec. room was completely clean and well kept.  The village probably still holds cooking classes for the residents.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" /></p><p>The most interesting part of the elementary school was the student entrance.  Across the 4 windows of the entrance were goodbye messages written by the students in the final year of the school.  The school's student must've been divided into 4 groups for doing activities, and cleaning, and whatever.  Each group got to write their messages on a window.</p><p>Many of the messages say <span class='ja'>いつでも</span>Happy (Always Happy), and <span class='ja'>高小サイユー</span> (Takane ES Goodbye).  It's hard to tell exactly how many students attended the school in its last year, but from counting the messages, maybe 30 or 40 students were there.</p><p>It's cute, and sad, but amazing that all these messages are still there 6 years after the fact.  A record.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2527.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 6 Months in Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/6-months-in-japan">6 Months in Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

My life is certainly different these days than it was a year ago.  Many things have changed, but I think I'm still pretty much the same.  It's quite a bit of fun.  There's always something new at school each day.  I've been incredibly busy, but I do stop to take some photos every now and then, so here are my favorite shots and favorite locations from the last 6 months.</p><div class='title'><b>Streets of Downtown Takayama</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0413.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0413.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0413.webp" /></p><p>In my first week of school, the Junior High students recommended several places I should visit in town.  And these are some back roads on the way to the downtown area of Takayama.</p><div class='title'><b>Enako River</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0416.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0416.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0416.webp" /></p><p>The Enako River is one of a few rivers in Takayama that all flow into Miya River which travels down the mountain to Toyama.</p><div class='title'><b>Snowy Streets</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0474.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0474.webp" /></p><p>It snowed almost every single day in Takayama until sometime in March when it started getting warmer.</p><div class='title'><b>Showa Hall</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0550.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0550.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0550.webp" /></p><p>In Downtown Takayama, there's a museum called Showa Hall, which is a storage area decorated to look like 1950s Japan.  They have a barber shop, diner, electronics store, toy store, classroom, and plenty of other things, too.  Though, the Mario posters in the toy store break the illusion a little bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Hida no Sato Goose</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0670.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0670.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0670.webp" /></p><p>Up on the side of a mountain, there's a little area called Hida no Sato, or Hida Folk Village.

The Hina Matsuri takes place on March 3rd, and celebrate's Girl's Day, or, sometimes, Doll's Day.  For Hina Matsuri, families will cover shelves with a red carpet and display dolls on them.  Many people associate this holiday with the beginning of Spring, and the start of warmer days ahead.</p><p>But, for the Hida Takayama area, Winter is still very strong, and the snow doesn't start melting for another month, at least.</p><p>For Hina Matsuri, I went to the Hida Folk Village in town, or Hida no Sato.  This village is a half-preserved, half-recreated area from a few hundred years ago.  All the homes represent the style of architecture at the time.</p><p>As you can see, it was still very much Winter on March 3rd up here.  There's no hint of Spring at all.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0666.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130303_hidanosato/IMG_0677_stitch.webp" /></p><p>But, they still displayed all the dolls in the houses.  Spring will come eventually!</p><div class='title'><b>Ikibina Matsuri</b></div><p>Since it's still Winter on March 3rd, the Hida Takayama area waits for one month, and has their own celebration on April 3rd, instead.  And rather than arranging a bunch of dolls on a red-carpeted display, young women and kids from the surrounding towns wear the outfits of the dolls, and parade around town.</p><p>Ikuko and I arrived in Miya around 10am.  All of the snow in the area had melted, but it was still rather cold and miserable.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1254.webp" /></p><p>It rained almost all day. :(  Usually, the parade will begin at the shrine, and continue down the street, along the river.

I kept seeing all these anime posters on the walls of stores, and museums.  They were all for the same anime, and they advertised Takayama.  So, upon further inspection, these posters mentioned a title: <b>Hyouka</b>.  Later, I looked it up on the Internet, and not only is it an anime, but the whole takes place in Takayama.</p><p>The anime centers on 4 high school students that go to Hida High School, a few blocks away from where I live. :)  Many locations in town are represented almost perfectly in the show, so it was really neat to watch that show when I first arrived.  Some of it was like an introduction video. :)</p><p>Overall, the show is OK.  It's not the best anime, but it doesn't suck.  The plot of the show centers are 4 high school students as they revive a literary club at the school, and then solve mysteries, instead.</p><p>I bring this up because for the final episode of the TV show, the main girl character, Eru Chitanda plays the lead in the Ikibina Matsuri.  So, the whole episode focuses on the festival, and a dumb mystery to solve.</p><p>Because of how accurate Hyouka represents areas in Takayama, the festival and the Ichinomiya Minasha Shrine was depicted rather well.</p><p>Here's a shot from the TV Show:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" /></p><p>And here's a photo I took:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" /></p><p>They're pretty close :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" /></p><p>That's the inside of the Shrine and the outside.</p><div class='title'><b>Satomi Satou</b></div><p>Eru Chitanda is voiced by Satomi Satou, who apparently a big deal since he also voiced a character in K-On, which is very popular.

These pictures of mine were original taken on <b>May 16th, 2010</b> when Dave and I want on a vacation to Kyushu, Japan.  We visited our friend Brett in Kagoshima, my friend Ikuko in Nagasaki, and we stopped off at Kumamoto, Shimabara, and Fukuoka.  On our second day in Kagoshima, we took a train northeast to Kirishima National Park.</p><p>Kirishima National Park is a volcanic mountain range with hiking trails that go up and down most of the mountains and volcanoes in the area.  From Kirishima's train station we hopped in a cab that took us Ebino-kogen.  The cab driver asked what we planned on doing in Kirishima, and I relayed my ambitious plan on hiking all 5 major mountains in the mountain range.  He replied with disbelief and caution from what I could tell.  As he brought Dave and I to our destination, he gave us his business card in case we were stuck somewhere and needed a ride.</p><p>He also gave us a engilsh map of the entire park which looks a lot like <a href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park">this</a>.  That way we wouldn't get lost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" /></p><p>Above is the map posted on the side of the road up the hill from Ebino-kogen.  We were on the red dot just a little east of Ebino-kogen.  My plan for Dave and I was to hike up Karakuni, and continue on over Shishiko-dake, Shinmoe-dake, Naka-dake, and Takachiho-mine.  And then catch a bus to a train station on the east or west side of Takachiho.  It was about 10am, I think, so I figured we had plenty of time to scale all 5 mountains/volcanoes.</p><p>We started along the hiking trail that lead up Karakuni-dake.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the opposite direction was a pile of rock and ash.

Man, I felt ready to tackle the next mountain on our list.  Though, before even leaving the peak of Karakuni-dake we had to go past a couple signs that said it was a bad idea.  The sign said, "Climbing Mt. Shinmoe is forbidden due to volcanic activity," along with a picture of a volcano erupting.  Whatever... that's just a suggestion.</p><p>We continued along the path, but this path was a lot less stable than the one we climbed up.  Much of the path had been washed away by landslides.  The rock and foot holds weren't stable, so I slipped quite a bit as I tried to press on.  Dave kept trying to convince me that this wasn't a good idea, and after slipping one too many times I finally agreed that we should turn around and go back.</p><p>This is probably what the cab driver was trying to warn us about.  And since I wasn't listening to his cautions, he probably gave us his phone number so wherever we ended up we could still get back to the train station.  That was nice of him. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7445.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7445.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7435.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7435.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7435.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7437_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, that's about how close we got to Shinmoe-dake.  Just a reminder that the date was May 16th, 2010.  You might remember that this volcano actually erupted in Janurary 2011.  And it didn't just erupt a little bit, it fucking exploded!  Here's the link Dave sent me a day or two after it happened from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/31/shinmoedake-erupts-l.html" title="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/01/31/shinmoedake-erupts-l.html">Boing Boing</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/boingboing3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/boingboing3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/boingboing3.webp" /></p><p>In the above photo from the Boing Boing link, you can clearly see the peak of Karakuni directly underneath the massive ash cloud.  Dave and I were there just 7 months prior. :D</p><p>So, it was pretty stupid of me to want to continue along the path and climb the actually active Shinmoe-dake, even after Dave continued to assure me that it was a bad idea.  We turned around and headed back up Karakuni-dake and reached the peak once again.  We made it back just as the clouds removed themselves and we were able to see everything!  We could clearly see into the crator of Karakuni-dake and it's ashy lake.  We could clearly see Shinmoe-dake as well.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7454_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7487_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7515.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7515.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7515.webp" /></p><p>Going back to the map, we noticed that Karakuni had 3 separate trails that climbed up to the peak.  There was the path we used to get up to the peak.  There was the one we tried to climb down, but were unable to traverse due to rock slides.  And the other path lead down to Oonami-ike.  So we headed that way.</p><p>From the get-go, the path was far far nicer to travel than the step rocky path we began the day with.

Traveling down a mountain is so much nicer than going up.  I think it took us about 30 minutes to get down to the crossroads before we set on the next trail that lead up the dormant volcano surrounding lake Oonami.  I think it took us another 15 minutes traveling along the Oonami trail before we caught our first glimpse of the volcanic lake.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" /></p><p>It was quite gorgeous, and scenic.

Looking back at <a href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park">this map</a>, we were on the other side of Oonami-ike and it was almost 2pm, or maybe it was 1:30pm.  I had a bus schedule on me that I must've picked up from the train station, that said the last bus heading out from Ebino-kogen was 3pm.  Back to the map, it would take us about an hour and a half for us to make it there.  </p><p>We had no time to spare anymore, and had to start bookin' it back to the bus stop.  Of course, we could've just taken a cab back to the train station, but we would rather pay the $3 rather than the $25 it was earlier in the day.  And I figured it might be a bit difficult to call our cab driver and explain the situation since my Japanese is not good.  So, we made some fast tracks to the bus stop.  Hiking is much more intense when you're running across the terrain at running speeds.</p><p>Trying to run, and climb over stuff like this is crazy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" /></p><p>The closer we got, the more of the terrain began to level off.  And as the trail ended we were able to keep a decent jogging pace on the paved road as we neared the bus stop.  I believe we made it there with 5 minutes to spare!</p><p>The journey back to Kagoshima was relaxing and enjoyable.  A reward for a fantastic day of climbing dormant and active volcanoes.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/18">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/japan/16">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
