My schools were fairly large.  My Junior High had about 400 students, and my main elementary school had 600.  My other elementary school was super tiny and had only 18 students in the entire school.  Because of the size, my elementary schools basically planned all the lessons, and I created materials and then followed their plan in class.</p><p>Well, things change.  In August 2013, I switched to much smaller schools.  I now have one Junior High with only 70 students.  And I have 3 elementary schools of 150, 200, and 400 students.  In the smaller 2 elementary schools I teach all grades, and in the other school, I teach 4th, 5th, and 6th.  My position is much more focused on elementary school teaching now.  Also, I am in the only English teacher in my elementary schools, so I do all the planning, material creating, and executing in class.</p><div class='title'><b>Lessons</b></div><p>The following are all my lesson plans I've written for use in my 3 elementary schools.  For all of my classes, I have 4 different levels that I write for:  6th, 5th, 4th and 3rd, and 2nd and 1st.  5th and 6th are the only grades that have a specific curriculum to follow.  The other grades are simply at the whim of the ALT.  The younger grades tend to have way more games, and repetition.</p><p>Most of the ideas I used for these lessons came from Englipedia, other Takayama ALTs and teachers, the recommended lesson plans, plans from my predecessor, the Team Teaching Pizza book, and random other websites.  Sometimes I get an original idea and try it out.</p><p>For each of these lessons, I will write out the plans almost a week in advance and discuss the upcoming class with the homeroom teachers.  I will ask for any help I need from them, and get their OK on the plan before executing in class.  After teaching the classes for long enough, you'll get a sense for the student's limits of English and study, but it's always good to talk with the teacher and explain anything you might think is challenging, or possibly difficult for the students.</p><div class='title'><b>Textbook</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140313_alt/IMG_3584.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140313_alt/IMG_3584.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140313_alt/IMG_3584.webp" /></p><p>In the official declaration of the Ministry of Education, in elementary school, only 5<span class='ja'>年生</span> and 6<span class='ja'>年生</span> are required to learn English.  They must have 35 hours throughout the entire year.  And this is the current text book the students are issued.  Hi Friends 1 and 2 - <span class='ja'>平成</span>24<span class='ja'>年</span>4<span class='ja'>月</span> version.  You can buy a copy of the textbook on Amazon for 95<span class='ja'>円</span>. :)  All my lesson plans and flash cards are based on this book, and occasionally I'll actually do an activity directly from the book.  I use the text book for a general layout of all my lessons throughout the year, but almost all the the instruction is in class teaching directly.  </p><div class='title'><b>Flash Cards</b></div><p>One really nice thing about Hi Friends is that the Data CD contains full PDF versions of each book.  Almost all the artwork in the book is in Vector format, which is AMAZING.  Most of the flashcards I've made for my classes has been from rasterizing those PDFs is various sizes.  It produces lossless perfect images.  But when the book doesn't provide good flash cards, I usually resort to Google Image Search, and try to find large photos aren't terribly quality.</p><div class='title'><b>Updated</b></div><p>This page now exists here: <a href="/old/v7/lessons" title="/lessons">ALT Materials & Lesson Plans</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Valentine's Day Snow" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/valentines-day-snow">Valentine's Day Snow</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This year is a little different, though.  When I arrived last year, it seemed like it snowed every single day.  Sometimes it snowed just a little bit.  Other days, it would snow all day long.</p><p>This year, there's been a few days where it seemed like the snow would never stop.  On Valentine's day this year, it snowed continuously for a day and a half.  I went outside a few times to shovel snow away from my car and parking space.</p><p>Also, snow in Takayama is a little different than it is in Wisconsin.  Takayama is completely surrounded by mountains.  They are an excellent deterrent for the wind.  When it snows, the snowflakes glide straight down to the ground and fall flat.  It's very peaceful, and beautiful, unlike Wisconsin.  While snow is still beautiful in Wisconsin, there's no natural barrier for the wind, so when it snows, the wind shoves it into your face.  The wind freezes the roads, and basically ruins everything.</p><p>When it snows in Takayama, it's like living in a snow globe.</p><p>On this Friday, I went to my Japanese class, and took some pictures along the way.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3444.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3504.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3512.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3512.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140214_snow/IMG_3512.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon">Takaoka Marathon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

One of which was to run in a half marathon over here, and today I finally accomplished that goal.  Some of the teachers I work with at an elementary school in town signed up to run in the Takaoka marathon.  Takaoka is a suburb of Toyama city about an hour and a half north of Takayama by highway.  Toyama has a population of about 425,000 people, so it's a bit bigger than Takayama.  Also, Toyama is right on the Sea of Japan, and not in the mountains, so it's about 10 degrees more warm.</p><p>The start time for the Half Marathon was 9am.  We left Takayama around 6:30am, just to make sure we'd get there with enough time.  We arrived around 8am, and didn't really have a whole lot to do for an hour.  Packet PIck-up was only available the morning of, so we collected our T-Shirts, bibs, race booklet, and what not.  This event was hosted by the University of Takaoka, so there weren't any merchandise tents, or similar things.  </p><p>It was a very academic and non-commercial event.  And many of the runners that showed up, seemed like professional athletes.  Way different than the marathons I've run before.  In the US, the marathons are an excuse for people to get into shape, and do their best.  It gives people a reason to exercise, and see if they can actually accomplish the feat of covering 13 miles by only using your legs.</p><p>The Takaoka marathon seemed like it was more of a contest for athletes.  There were several elderly people there, who weren't viewing this as a race, but many of the other runners were pretty serious.  Out of the 672 Half marathon participants, it didn't seem like many were just there for exercise and for fun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" /></p><p>I put on my headphones, and began listening to Underworld as the starting horn fired.  The first 1 or 2 kilometers of this race were terrible.  At the start of any marathon, the route is completed congested, so you need to give a wide area for everyone to move around each other.  Let the fast glide through the crowd, so they don't ruin their pace.</p><p>The start of the race went around the race track, down the hill, and then around another race track so the entire course could fit the 21.1 kilometers of a half marathon.  Ugh?  They should really add the course stretching segments towards the middle of the race.</p><p>After getting away from the beginning, the whole course was really rather nice.  The course took us up to the beach of the Sea of Japan, then back through the country-side a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp"/></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp"/></p><p>Before running the race, I knew their was a time limit.  You had to finish under 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I was running around the 15 kilometer when I started actually thinking about this and doing the math in my head.  "Let's see..  150 divided by 20 is 7.5.  7 times 21 is 147.. " I was running at about 7 minutes per km, so I figured I was in good shape to finish.  But, I really had no idea what would happen if I didn't make the 2:30.</p><p>Well, at 17.4km, I came face-to-face with what happens.  You're forced to retire.  At the 17.4 km mark, there was a 2 hour checkpoint, which I arrived at 2 hours 1 minute and 49 seconds.  I guess 7 minutes per km wasn't fast enough.  I arrived, and the dude said, it's finished.  A few more people behind me caught up, and were also stopped.  Bahh..</p><p>A few minutes later, the bus of shame showed up and we all got inside.  Something I didn't realize at the time was I had already passed the 1 hour 30 minute checkout a few kilometers back at 12.7km.  I mean, I saw the clock and everything, but I didn't realize that was a "do or die" checkpoint.  I made it there around 1:27 or 1:28.</p><p>The bus of shame had about 20 people.  The bus drove us back to the start on the rest of the course.  We easily caught up to the last 2 people who made it through the 2 hour check mark, and they were just walking the whole way back.  Pfftt, what kind of bullshit is that.  I was going at a faster pace than these guys were.  I could have easily made the 2:30 finish line.  Bahh..</p><p>I had to turn in my bib, rather than be able to keep it.  Whatever.</p><p>I suppose this is why there were so many athletes present, rather than casual marathon runners.  But, at least I now know what I'm getting into for these marathons in Japan.  It seems that they all have a time limit, and they do clearly mark all the checkpoints on the website, and in the information packet.</p><p>So, while I completed my goal of running in a marathon in Japan, it feels rather disappointing since I didn't finish.  Well, for 2014, I definitely plan on running again, and actually completing one!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okura Waterfall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okura-waterfall">Okura Waterfall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's about a 15 minute drive whether it's by highway, or by country roads.  Kiyomi is a very narrow village.  The Seseragi Road travels the entire length of the village from it's most southern point to the center of the town in the northwest.  Another road goes directly east from there covering the rest of the village.  It's about an hours drive to cover all of Seseragi, but it shows just how stunning beautiful the nature of the Japanese mountains can be.  </p><p>I recently did a report about Kiyomi.  There's about 3000 residents.  The main industry of Kiyomi is farming, of which most are dairy farmers.  Turns out there are actually more cows in Kiyomi than people.  There's more than 5000 registered cows.</p><p>98% of Kiyomi is heavily wooded and mountainous terrain.  As their website states, Kiyomi is mostly wilderness, and everything else is inhabited by close and loving families of farmers.  Any random person you talk with in Kiyomi will mention how great Kiyomi is for being with family.</p><p>But, in that 98% wilderness, there are some beautiful hiking trails, camp grounds, and waterfalls, too.

Like many places, Takayama has many unique qualities that set it apart from other areas in Japan.  One of these unique qualities is that Takayama is the largest city in Japan by area.  It is 2178 km<superscript>2</superscript>, which is the size of most counties in Wisconsin.</p><p>It was only recently that this happened, too.  In 2005, there was some government restructuring, and several neighboring villages became under the Takayama Municipality.  These are the villages of Shokawa, Kiyomi, Kokofu, Nyukawa, Miya, Kuguno, Asahi, Kamitakara, and Takane.  Their government offices became branches of Takayama, and Takayama's government now ran these towns, too.  Or something like that.</p><p>Despite having such a large land area, there's only 92,000 some people living here.  And only 60,000 or 70,000 people in the central Takayama city.  The outer lands of Takayama have a lot of mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods in the valleys connected by narrow winding roads.  The most distant and ill-populated of which is Takane.</p><p>Even at the time of the merge, Takane didn't even have 1000 residents.  Wikipedia says they had 780 in 2003.  But, they were still their own municipality, complete with its very own Elementary and Junior High schools.  At least they did until 2007.  2 years after the Takayama merge, with such few students, they closed those schools down.  And the school children of Takane now take a bus to the next village over, Asahi.</p><p>Over the summer, I wanted to visit Takane, and see what this forest oasis looked like, and I went with new ALT Simona who had just arrived in Japan 2 weeks prior.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2489.webp" /></p><p>And this is basically it.  After driving through some thick forests, and windy mountain roads, there are a few houses, a couple of buildings, and then the forests open up a little bit, and you're greeting with the post office.  Takane is a very vertical village.  The residents shaved off a side of the one of mountains, and set up town.  There's a ryokan, city hall, the post office, several houses, rice fields, and a few apartment buildings.  But, there's really no commerce at all.  No convenience store.  Not even a grocery store.  I think there was a liquor store, though.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2481.webp" /></p><p>This place reminds me of LOST.</p><p>Most of the traffic through the town are logging trucks heading up river to the logging camps past the massive dams.</p><div class='title'><b>Takane JHS / <span class='ja'>高根中</span></b></div><p>Tucked away on the ends of the town were the former schools.  Takane JHS was near the center of the town.  Anyone living in town could easily walk there.  It's on the other side of the valley, and mostly visible from the town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2514.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2519.webp" /></p><p>Most of the school was abandoned and no longer cared for.  The foot lockers in the entrance way were all torn up.  And the inside of the gym was dirty and probably hadn't been visited in over a year.  Out back was the incinerator, and changing rooms which had plenty of rust and wood damage.</p><p>Though, right next to the gym was a "gate ball" arena, so the elderly people in town were still coming up here on a regular basis.  (Gate ball is very similar to croquet)</p><div class='title'><b>Takane ES / <span class='ja'>高根小</span></b></div><p>On the way into and out of town is Takane ES.  Unlike the Junior High, this building still showed plenty signs of use.  Looking in the windows, we could clearly see that the Home Ec. room was completely clean and well kept.  The village probably still holds cooking classes for the residents.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2534.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2532.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130816_takane/IMG_2524.webp" /></p><p>The most interesting part of the elementary school was the student entrance.  Across the 4 windows of the entrance were goodbye messages written by the students in the final year of the school.  The school's student must've been divided into 4 groups for doing activities, and cleaning, and whatever.  Each group got to write their messages on a window.</p><p>Many of the messages say <span class='ja'>いつでも</span>Happy (Always Happy), and <span class='ja'>高小サイユー</span> (Takane ES Goodbye).  It's hard to tell exactly how many students attended the school in its last year, but from counting the messages, maybe 30 or 40 students were there.</p><p>It's cute, and sad, but amazing that all these messages are still there 6 years after the fact.

My life is certainly different these days than it was a year ago.  Many things have changed, but I think I'm still pretty much the same.  It's quite a bit of fun.  There's always something new at school each day.  I've been incredibly busy, but I do stop to take some photos every now and then, so here are my favorite shots and favorite locations from the last 6 months.</p><div class='title'><b>Streets of Downtown Takayama</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0413.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0413.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0413.webp" /></p><p>In my first week of school, the Junior High students recommended several places I should visit in town.

They have a barber shop, diner, electronics store, toy store, classroom, and plenty of other things, too.  Though, the Mario posters in the toy store break the illusion a little bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Hida no Sato Goose</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0670.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0670.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_0670.webp" /></p><p>Up on the side of a mountain, there's a little area called Hida no Sato, or Hida Folk Village.

I kept seeing all these anime posters on the walls of stores, and museums.  They were all for the same anime, and they advertised Takayama.  So, upon further inspection, these posters mentioned a title: <b>Hyouka</b>.  Later, I looked it up on the Internet, and not only is it an anime, but the whole takes place in Takayama.</p><p>The anime centers on 4 high school students that go to Hida High School, a few blocks away from where I live. :)  Many locations in town are represented almost perfectly in the show, so it was really neat to watch that show when I first arrived.  Some of it was like an introduction video. :)</p><p>Overall, the show is OK.  It's not the best anime, but it doesn't suck.  The plot of the show centers are 4 high school students as they revive a literary club at the school, and then solve mysteries, instead.</p><p>I bring this up because for the final episode of the TV show, the main girl character, Eru Chitanda plays the lead in the Ikibina Matsuri.  So, the whole episode focuses on the festival, and a dumb mystery to solve.</p><p>Because of how accurate Hyouka represents areas in Takayama, the festival and the Ichinomiya Minasha Shrine was depicted rather well.</p><p>Here's a shot from the TV Show:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m04s126.webp" /></p><p>And here's a photo I took:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/IMG_1257.webp" /></p><p>They're pretty close :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h34m14s219.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130403_ikibina_matsuri/vlcsnap-2013-04-05-10h29m28s182.webp" /></p><p>That's the inside of the Shrine and the outside.</p><div class='title'><b>Satomi Satou</b></div><p>Eru Chitanda is voiced by Satomi Satou, who apparently a big deal since he also voiced a character in K-On, which is very popular.

| July 2, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About a week ago, I was at a JET related event, and one of the other attendees made mention of the following books: Tonoharu.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3261.webp"  /></p><p>Tonoharu is a graphic novel series written by a former JET, and is loosely based on his own experiences while teaching abroad for 3 years.  The author, Lars Martinson, taught from 2003 to 2006 in Fukuoka, Japan.  I assume he means Fukuoka prefecture, and not Fukuoka city.  The story is set in the small fictional town of Tonoharu, and mentions its about an hour away from any major city.</p><div class='title'><b>Prologue</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3262.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3265.webp"  /></p><p>Before we get into the actual story of Tonoharu, Lars starts everything off in the prologue.  These several pages focus on Lars himself as he nears the end of his first year contract.  He reflects on the past 8 months of his stay in Japan, and wonders whether or not to renew.  The life hasn't been what he expected, and he's had several challenges to face he wasn't prepared for.</p><p>I think this section is rather brilliant, because through explaining his own situation, we're also introduced to the actual characters in the book.  He also foreshadowing all the events to happen over the course of the 3 book series as well.  All things I didn't pay attention to at all until I read it a second time.</p><div class='title'><b>Part One</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3268.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3271.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3275.webp"  /></p><p>The main character in Tonoharu is <b>Dan Welles</b>, and he is Lars' predecessor.  The story focuses on Dan's experience teaching abroad.  It begins with Dan meeting his own predecessor, and attending his welcoming party.  It continues with Dan's first classes at his school, and giving his self-introduction class lesson.  And it expands on Dan's character, and introduces several other characters too.</p><p>The story throughout Part One seems like a pretty good introduction to the type of situations one would have when teaching English in Japan's grade school system.  I guess it's implied that Dan is in the JET Programme, but it's never directly referenced.  Also, given that Lars' started JET in 2003, I'm assuming that this is supposed to take place in 2002.  I'm not sure why Dan doesn't have a cellphone, or why he never researches anything on a computer.  This ain't the 90s.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3277.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3278.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3280.webp"  /></p><p>Dan is a completely fictional character.  Well... at least, I really hope he's completely fictional.  Dan is an unconfident unprepared unmotivated person.  He doesn't seem to have any hobbies, or desires, or any real personality.  He kind of acts like some people I used to know...</p><p>At first, I figured the guy was just shy.  I consider myself a little bit shy, so I can relate, and being thrown into certain situations can make me very nervous, and seemingly uninteresting, or boring, or whatever.  So, at the beginning, I figured Dan was just adjusting to the new culture and taking things slow.</p><p>But he never pulls himself out of this rut.  I don't think he's too afraid to branch out, he just doesn't know how to.  I guess he does try asking people about what things to do, and he tries to make friends with people...  and they all blow him off.  But he just stops at that point.  He feels like all of his avenues are cut off, so he doesn't know how to take care of himself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3282.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3284.webp"  /></p><p>...and as such, he gets even more depressed.</p><p>This guy is basically the Charlie Brown of the JET Programme.  Nothing seems to go his way, and he keeps taking all the shit that life gives him.</p><div class='title'><b>Part Two</b></div><p>Part Two represents a bit of a change for the series.  It still focuses on Dan, and his incredible unmotivated depression, but expands on all the characters introduced in Part One.  In fact, I think Lars spends way too much time on the character interactions that the uniqueness of this taking place in Japan seems to fade away.  I guess that could represent that over time all the things that seem unique and interesting become normal and mundane because you're used to them.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3287.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3288.webp"  /></p><p>But he's really building a story.  I think the down to earth nature of the comic is absolutely it's strong point, he really needs a story, and I think that's when the fictiveness of the entire series starts breaking the reality a bit.  Now we have the kooky rich europeans that the whole town hates.  And the stereotypical "playboy" who sleeps with all kinds of women.  And a love interest too! though that trope felt very natural in its execution.</p><p>Overall, I think it's still very good.  And the art is really unique too.  It's very simple and straightforward like a typical newspaper comic, but has an incredible amount of detail and complexity when it needs it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_tonoharu/IMG_3289.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Part Three</b></div><p>This is a 3 part graphic novel series, and, at the moment, only two volumes have been finished.

In a semi-recent <a href="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/" title="http://larsmartinson.com/tonoharu-part-three-progress-report-2/">blog post</a> he mentions that he's a third of the way complete!</p><p>Also, reading through Lars' blog, it seems that he's back in Japan again, and he's been writing a web comic series about his current misadventures entitled the <b>Kameoka Dairies</b>.  This series is much more direct about specific subjects he's come across from daily life in Japan, rather than building an all encompassing story.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>This series does feel a bit negative about the experiences one might have when teaching English in Japan, but after taking a hard look at the main character, it feels like he's done this to himself.  If you're active, know how to ask questions, and have motivation to get the most out of life, I don't think you'd have as rough a time as our pal Dan did.</p><p>I think if you've ever been in JET, or are interested in joining JET, this book series is a must read.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/20">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/japan/18">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
