Despite traveling through the area numerous times throughout the last 10 years, I've never noticed this structure perched on the hill.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp"/></a></p><p>After parking at the Sarukura Forest Park alongside several barbecue bits, you are presented with 440 steps that ascend to an altitude of 345 meters. It takes about 10 minutes, which isn't so bad unless you aren't prepared for it. As you reach the top, you'll find the wind castle, pictured above.</p><p>This is the summit of Sarukura Mountain <span class='ja'>猿倉山</span>, and from the observation deck, you can see all the way to Toyama Bay on a clear day.</p><p>I took a bunch of photos and put them together into a huge panoramic shot.</p><p class='img'><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" /><br/>Hi-Res Panoramic: /wind_castle_panoramic_hi.png (186.5mb)</a></p></p><p>You can see nearly all of Toyama, and there is a free-to-use binocular scope so you see the airport, sports arena, and other areas in clear view.</p><p>Apparently, around 1558 to 1570, the summit of Sarukura Mountain was the site of the Sarukura Castle <span class='ja'>猿倉城</span>, but nothing remains today. The military commander at the time was under the command of the ruler of the Hida region to the south. Hida is surrounded by mountains, so there are very few ways of getting up there. This castle was built to monitor any large armies that may be headed up the mountain to attack.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>This path can be clearly seen today in the above panoramic. There's an incredible clear view of Hwy 41 coming down from Hida. </p><p>It still completely baffles me that I never noticed this place before. Although, I think it's easy to see why I hadn't noticed it before. On my way back home up to Hida, I took some reverse photos looking back at the mountain and the castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The white castle blends into the sky very easily. If you didn't know it was there, you would never notice it. But, once you know that it's there and where to look, it pops out.</p><p>There's also not a whole lot of information about the Wind Castle online. In fact, my friend and I only found this thing by skimming around Toyama in Google Maps looking for something to do. I wanted to know exactly when they built this thing, and its purpose. </p><p>There's a plaque on the Wind Caste which states the following: <br/><b><span class='ja'>平成</span>2<span class='ja'>年度</span></b> <I>Heisei-2 (or 1990)</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>中部通商産業局</span> <span class='ja'>地域エネルギー開発利用発電モデル事業</span></b> <I>Chubu Bureau of International Trade and Industry Regional Energy Development Utilization Power Generation Model Project</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>「風の城</span> <span class='ja'>風力エネルギー開発利用事業」</span></b><I>"The Wind Castle - Wind Energy Development Utilization Project"</I><br/><b>-<span class='ja'>富山県大沢野町</span></b> <I>- Osawano Town, Toyama Prefecture.</I></p><p>Quite a mouthful. Seems like it was built in 1990, although I wanted to find more substantial information online. Eventually I did find a blog post of someone talking about Sarukura castle (explained earlier), and a few other things. In particular, in 1975, as part of Toyama prefecture's 100th year anniversary, a 9.6km trail was opened from Mt. Sarukura to Mt. Kosami Gozen <span class='ja'>小佐波御前山</span>. It didn't mention anything about the Wind Castle at that time. </p><p>I didn't find anything that confirmed its opening in 1990. But, it was probably built in 1990 as its architecture and flashy nature seems to fit that time well. Like everything built during the economic high times of the 80s and 90s in Japan, it is definitely showing wear and tear from the years. Some of the windows have been kicked out, and the metal railing has graffiti almost everywhere. One of the door had been kicked in, too.</p><p>If you've never been, I would absolutely recommend driving up here if you're going to or from Toyama. I will probably return here each time I visit Toyama now. Different weather, different season, and different time of day will all create a new view. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nishi-cho-taiki">Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been out of the ramen game a little while, and also Takayama's ramen has very thin noodles and thin broth. The standard size is pretty much the perfect amount of ramen.  Yet, they also offered sizes that were 1.5 times and double the standard.  I don't know how anyone could eat those.</p><p>With all the onions and pepper, the ramen had a somewhat hidden, gradually building, and lingering spiciness to it, which was very unique. I always consume everything I order, so I always eat/drink the broth, which is not the Japanese norm. The broth was very dark with the amount of soy-sauce infused in it. Ramen isn't the most healthy food to begin with, but with the amount of soy-sauce included, I would not recommend eating/drinking all of it, like I had. With the amount of onions and pepper in there, too, I needed a lot more water than what they provided.</p><p>Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Black Ramen. I wouldn't put it very high of a pantheon of ramen.</p><p>You can find more information about the restaurant on their website: <a href="http://www.nisicho-taiki.com/" title="http://www.nisicho-taiki.com/">http://www.nisicho-taiki.com/</a></p><p>Also, here's a scan of their pamphlet.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_ramen/nishicho-taiki-pamphlet_t.webp" /></a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Matsukura 松倉 and Emaichi 絵馬市" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura 松倉 and Emaichi 絵馬市</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 11, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Takayama is a city surrounded by mountains and nature. These mountains lead to excellent vantage points of the city, but all have their own history, too. The southwest mountains of Matsukura <span class='ja'>松倉</span> and Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span> used to be the center point of the ruling class of the town.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></b></div><p>Back in the 1500s, Hida was its own province amongst the warring states, and the rulers were the Anekouji Clan <span class='ja'>姉小路</span>. Takayama was the most prosperous area of Hida because it was the most open. Farmers could easily till the land and feed all of its people. There was plenty of roam to rear livestock, such as horses and cows. And, Hida was also known for its expert carpenters. The mountain of Matsukura overlooked the entirety of Takayama, so it was the perfect point to build a stronghold to defend the city. This was Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span>.</p><p>Towards the end of the 1500s, Oda Nobunaga <span class='ja'>織田信長</span> had begun his conquest of defeating all independent clan and armies and unifying Japan as a single country. In 1585, he dispatched Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span> to ascend the mountains of Hida and destroy the Anekouji Clan to claim the territory. The Anekouji Clan was easily outmatched, defeated, and killed.</p><p>With Hida and Takayama under the control of Nobunaga through Kanamori, peace came to the city, and Kanamori transformed the city into a vacation town for his rich friends. He built a new lavish castle, the Takayama Castle, closer to the center of town, and left Matsukura to rot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, Matsukura Castle is a complete ruin, and even those ruins fall further and further apart with each year. <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">9 years ago</a>, I traveled up to the top for the first time, and I did it again <a href="/old/v7/harayama-in-winter" title="/harayama-in-winter">a few months later</a> to compare the seasons.

He was a troublesome child and leader, so the entire clan was removed from the Hida province in 1692 and transferred to modern day Yamagata.</p><p>At the same time, a buddhist monk named Tenden Koutou <span class='ja'>天電高幢</span> returned from his position at the Sennyu-ji Temple <span class='ja'>泉涌寺</span> in Kyoto, and built a shrine to Kannon in a cave of Matsukura mountain.

People will often pray to Kannon for protection from illness and prosperity for their family and livelihood. Kannon has six transformations, and the Matsukura Kannon Temple specifically prays to the Bato Kannon transformation.</p><p>Bato Kannon is the more violent and warlike transformation, characterized by a menacing horse head. Horses were a very important animal and symbol of old Hida. There were used for farming, transportation, and many people considered them members of their family. People from Hida and even further would travel with their horses to the temple on July 9th every year, to pray for the wellbeing and protection of their horses.</p><div class='title'><b>Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> and Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span></b></div><p>Traveling up the mountain isn't so difficult today, but this was not the case 400 years ago. It caused a lot of stress for the horse. So, artists began painting horses on paper and selling them in downtown Takayama. These horse paintings were called Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span>, which literally translates to Horse Painting. Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span> means Horse Painting Market.</p><p>At this market, farmers would buy whichever horse painting they thought looked most like their horse. Then, they would bring this painting up the mountain to the Matsukura temple instead of their actual horse.</p><p>Over time, this painted horse became a symbol for more than just their horse. Because a family would rely on their horse for their farm, the horse painting now encompassed a person's entire farm or business. Families also consider their horse a member of their family, so the horse painting protection began to expand to other members of the family, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Modern Day Emaichi</b></div><p>These days, the tradition continues. Almost every business throughout Hida (and most residences, too) will have a horse painting at the entrance. Pointed inward, the horse painting offers protection and prosperity for the business or family inside.</p><p>Every year on August 9th and 10th, the Bato Kannon deity is moved from the main Kannon temple in downtown Takayama into the Matsukura mountain. At this time, horse paintings are created for anyone that comes to visit and a Buddhist monk of the Kannon temple will infuse his prayer into the painting.</p><p><a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">8 years ago</a>, I came here for the first time after finally learning about the origins of the horse paintings that I saw everywhere. People get a fresh horse painting every year to renew their protection and luck, but I think it worked out pretty well for me.</p><p>This year was the first time the Emaichi was held in person since Covid.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_6108_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I visited the temple during the day to get some order forms.

Retro museums focus on the era of economic revival of post-war Japan and all of the culture that came from it. Most items are from the 1950s and 1960s. But lately, some of these museums have added things from the 70s and 80s, sometimes even 90s.</p><p>I love retro museums because it's all history that our modern culture and society have been built upon. You could say that all history has built our modern lives, but recent history of 50 to 60 years is so close that you can easily make those connections to modern day and see how things have changed from not that long ago.</p><p>Showa Hall was one of the first touristy places I visited in Takayama when I first arrived 10 years ago, and I fell in love with the idea of retro museums. Last week, we had a field trip at school where we walked around town and viewed the town like a tourist, so I returned.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp"/></a></p><p>While Takayama has changed quite a bit in the 10 years I've lived here, the Showa Hall remains almost identical.

The Showa era ended in 1989 and ushered in the Heisei era.  But the 90s are Retro, so it still somewhat makes sense.  Maybe some of the J-pop records from the music store downstairs were already walking that fine line.</p><p>As mentioned above, I love Retro Showa-era Museums because the history is so close. But it's still history that I never actually lived, so even though it was near history, it was still distant.  The 90s are WAY different because not only had I lived through them before, they're only 30 years ago.</p><p>Also mentioned above, I revisited the Showa Hall during a school field trip, so they were many students in the museum at the same time, and I was with some teachers, too. One teacher is getting pretty close to 60-years-old, so he lived through the era with many of the items in the museum. He commented how he his school classroom looked identical to the one in the museum, and how he had memorized most of the music in the store from hearing it so many times.  His reaction was much more of a nostalgia trip than a "ugh I'm getting old" feeling.</p><p>Also, the 90s gaming stuff is really just tacked on. They aren't trying to recreate a 90s gaming room. They're just displaying a bunch of games and have the mini consoles up. Really low effort. You can get the exact same experience by going to any used game store. Maybe this better explains my apprehension of their 90s gaming display.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Showa Hall is still one of my favorite places in Takayama. Another Retro Museum had also opened in the last 10 years, but it's much more of a circus rather than a caringly curated collection and recreation of the times. I would recommend visiting if you ever come to Takayama. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Gifu Retro Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gifu-retro-museum">Gifu Retro Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 15, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Japan is a country rich in history, and a country that is rich in history is also rich in museums. There are many national and prefectural museums that focus on the history of Japan both for culture and art. However, almost all of these museums focus on periods of Japan up through the Meiji era (through 1912) and World War II. Very few focus on the development of Japan after.</p><p>To pick up the slack, there are many independent <b>Retro</b> museums that can be found in small towns and resort towns. Owners of these museums curate their personal collections of 50-60 year old technology and memorabilia. Most of these gathered from friends or business upgrading their old stuff.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp"></a></p><p>The <b>Gifu Retro Museum</b> is a little different than other retro museum I've been to before. It does curate stuff from the past, but it would be more accurate to call this a Retro Amusement Center. The entry fee is timed, rather than a flat fee.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><u>Adults to Junior High students</u><br/>One hour is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 3000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column"><u> Elementary school students </u><br/>One hour is 500<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 1300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><u>Children ages 4 to 6 years old</u><br/>One hour is 300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 800<span class='ja'>円</span></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The "museum" is divided into three distinct separate rooms, each with their own distinctive feel and purpose. I'm sure that the entry pass is required for all three areas. The three rooms are the main room in the middle, which has snacks and arcade machines, the pachinko room on the right, and the food lounge to the left. </p><div class='title'><b>Main Room</b></div><p>When you enter the middle room, there are old posters and knick knacks pinned to the wall and sitting on old arcade machines and soda machines. When you exit the immediate entrance area, you exit an old style candy shop with lots of sweets and candy for sale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>A few arcade games and several amusement games are fit against the walls where there is space. There is a wack-a-mole game and racing game that probably distributed tickets back in the day. There's a flag game, where the characters tell you to raise or lower flags. There's also a Janken game where you deposit some amount of coin medals. If you win, a roulette will spin and its possible to get 20 times your coins back.</p><p>For Arcade machines, they had an After Burner and Super Hang-on machine. They had a Neo Geo switcher with a few games installed. A cocktail Nintendo VS cabinet, with Super Mario Bros, Mario Bros, and a few others. They had a cabinet with Darkstalkers currently installed. (Curious if they had any other CPS2 games in the back.)</p><p>With the entry paid for time, all arcade games were set to Free Play. So, you could do whatever you like. I played the Flag game for a little bit, trying to quickly understand the Japanese, and I played the Janken game too. The Janken game would be a really fun programming project if I get the chance to learn FPGA programming.</p><div class='title'><b>Pachinko Room</b></div><p>The Main Room leads into the Pachinko room, which is also accessible from the outside. This seems to be the main draw for people to come here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp"/></a></p><p>The Pachinko room has two rows full of machines from the late 80s and early 90s. They probably rescued this from an old Pachinko parlor that was getting demolished. All machines work and already had a few people on them right as the museum opened in the morning.</p><p>I wasn't exactly sure how the room was supposed to work. In a real pachinko parlor, you buy your balls and go to town on a machine. But, I wasn't sure if you still bought balls even after paying the entry fee, or if you could just grab a tray and mess around? Bleh, I really should've asked, but I was already self-conscious enough with the clerks constantly watching me take photos.</p><p>This seems like a pretty good activity for the elderly people living in the town. Rather than have them blow tons of money at a real pachinko parlor, they could pay $30 to sit in here all day. They could play the pachinko games they may have played years ago, and try to beat each other's high scores. It would be an amazing place to have a pachinko tournament, too.</p><p>I would imagine you could use the balls for free because if you actually had to pay for the balls, then they would have to pay out if you actually won a lot.</p><div class='title'><b>Food Area</b></div><p>The third area to the right of the entrance is the food area where they have collected several vintage vending machines.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp"/></a></p><p>There were some vending machine that gave out ice cream and burgers, but many of them sold noodles. I think they were all in working order, but I didn't try any of them out. It was still early in the morning, and I had lunch plans for later.</p><p>The best part of this room was the Mac and Me banner advertising the home video release.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>I think if you plan on playing vintage Pachinko for a few hours, it would be worth the visit. But otherwise, there were too few arcade games to make it worthwhile and there really weren't that many knick knacks to consider it a true retro museum. It's a bit expensive, too, so I wouldn't really recommend it.</p><p>The <b>Gifu Retro Museum</b> is located in Yamagata City, north of Gifu. Here's the location in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7" title="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7">Google Maps</a>. The parking lot is behind the building, which can be difficult to understand when you first arrive.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pocket Camera with Zoom Lens" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens">Pocket Camera with Zoom Lens</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

You can read more about here: <a href="/old/v7/gameboy-camera-plus" title="/gameboy-camera-plus">/gameboy-camera-plus</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" /></p><p>Attached to the Pocket Camera Plus, I'm using a pretty generic and bare bones Zoom lens. I just bought whatever was cheapest on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">Amazon</a>. It has manually focus, zoom, and aperture, and has a focus length of 6mm up to 60mm. I guess that means it has a 10x zoom. Each of the rings has a pin used for movement, but these pins can be screwed in to keep the current setting.</p><p>In addition to the manual settings of the lens, the GameBoy Camera game has a Contrast and Brightness setting. Contrast is very important to reduce the harsh lights and darks coming into the camera. There is some automatic brightness control that the camera already does. This makes the manual aperture nearly useless. And even the digital brightness settings in the game can get overridden by the software trying to autocorrect the brightness.</p><p>For the following photos, I really only used the manual Zoom and Focus, and digital Contrast when taking photos.</p><p>Anyway, with my Pocket Camera and regular Camera, I went around town throughout the weekend and tested it out.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakurano Park <span class='ja'>桜野公園</span></b></div><p>It's Spring in Takayama, so the Cherry Blossoms are in full boom. One of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Takayama is northwest of the main town. On the way to Kokufu, Sakurano Park is off to the side of the highway on the other side of the river. It's the perfect place to have a picnic on a warm Spring afternoon while viewing the cherry blossoms. (Although, this Spring has been freezing with the occasional snow)</p><p>I took some photos in late evening as the sun was setting.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div

incredible amount of flexibility when taking photos. No matter how close or how far away from the subject, the zoom allows you to frame the photo and the focus allows you to get all of the detail. The sensor itself is still primitive by only allowing 4 colors, but you can still get a ton of clarity.</p><p>Of course, photos are best taken when the subject is clearly light. If there is no strong light source, then it can be hard to squeeze out detail. 4 colors can only do so much.</p><div class='title'><b>Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span></b></div><p>The next day, I went to Shiroyama Park downtown and took a few more photos.

| April 4, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>From March 21st through June 11th, the National Craft Museum in Kanazawa, Ishikawa is hosting an exhibit entitled, Pokemon x Kouge. Kouge <span class='ja'>工芸</span> is Japanese for crafts, such as pottery, woodworking, and any other profession that designs and creates materials and works. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" /></a></p><p>20 Japanese artisans and craftsmen, from young to old, were challenged with how they could incorporate Pokemon into their works. How could they make something that could display the essence of a Pokemon, whether it be through their appearance, gestures, or traces of gameplay through trading, evolving, or battling? How would a particular Pokemon's personality or history clash or match with traditional crafts? With these questions and ideas, they have created over 70 original works displayed in this exhibit.</p><p>Here's the website: <a href="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/" title="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/">https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/</a></p><p>Also, here's the exhibit brochure:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing"> https://drive.google.com/.../15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK</a></p><p>A friend sent me a link to this exhibit. I had seen a link about it before, but I didn't realize it was in Kanazawa. So close! I thought it was in Tokyo, or Osaka, or something. So, I went there on Thursday March 30th and arrived around 11:30am. There was a line to enter, but I only had to wait 20 minutes. Not too bad for a Thursday. They had reservation tickets available, which would probably be necessary on weekends. Individual tickets were 900<span class='ja'>円</span>. You can buy tickets online, too.</p><p>The exhibit was divided into three sections: Appearance, Stories, and Life. All of my photos are included at the bottom.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>すがたーせまる</span>！ Appearance - Approach!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first room were works inspired by the appearance of the Pokemon. How does a Pokemon's appearance inspire these craftsmen to use their mastery to develop artwork that evokes both the spirit of the Pokemon and a demonstration of the mastery of their craft. This section featured artwork from Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> and Mitsuta Haruo <span class='ja'>満田晴穂</span> (both Metal Works), Fukuda Toru <span class='ja'>福田亭</span> (Wood Works), and Imai Sadamasa <span class='ja'>今井完眞</span> and Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span> (Ceramics).</p><p>My favorite pieces from this section was the Jolteon by Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> (pictured above), and the vase and bowl entitled "Vase with Pokemon of the Universe" <span class='ja'>森羅万像ポケモン壷</span> and "Beautiful Bowl with the Super-Ancient of Pokemon" <span class='ja'>超古代ポケモン玉盌</span>. Both were created by Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span>. (pictured below)</p><p>The Pokemon vase was interesting because you could stare at it for hours searching for various Pokemon and continue to find new ones you hadn't before. Also, I love how the Hoenn legendary pokemon are depicted in the Beautiful Bowl, clashing the power of fire, water, and wind.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>ものがたりー浸る</span>！ Stories - Jump in!</b></div><p>The second room features works inspired by the aspects of the Pokemon adventure, such as catching, battling, and evolving. While collecting Pokemon themselves is very much core to the series, the journey of the starting off at the beginning and slowly growing and strengthening your Pokemon and yourself as you become the strongest trainer in the land is equally inspiring. Works in this section were created by Tanaka Nobuyuki <span class='ja'>田中信行</span> and Ikeda Terumasa <span class='ja'>池田晃将</span> (Lacquerware), Niimi Hiroki <span class='ja'>新實広記</span>and Ikemoto Kazumi <span class='ja'>池本一三</span> (Glass Works), Hayashi Shigeki <span class='ja'>林茂樹</span> (Ceramics), Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span> (Metal Works), and Shiromi Eiichi <span class='ja'>城間栄市</span> and Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> (Textiles).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Hayashi Shigeki's Robot (Moonlight) greeted everyone when the reached the top of the stairs. All of the vases were really goofy, and the yukatas were pretty. The Yukatas, created by Shiromi Eiichi, were made using a Bingata pattern-style, traditional to Okinawa. These have repeated patterns of nature using primary colors of red, blue, yellow, green, and pink. The Alola starters, Pikachu, Raichu, and Oricorio fit both the pattern of colors, and island theme.</p><p>I think the biggest standouts to me were the transformable Rookidee figures which "evolve" into Corviknight, by Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span>. Obviously the size is off, but the proportions of both Pokemon are perfect, and coming up with a design to allow them to transform into each other is fascinating. The Pikachu forest, created by Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> was definitely the center piece of the room.

How can the flame of the Pokemon match the fires of the kiln when baking jars? How can the spirit and energy of Pokemon enlighten kimono and ornaments used in festivals? Craftsmen from this section include Katsura Morihito <span class='ja'>桂盛仁</span> (Metal Works), Taguchi Yoshiaki <span class='ja'>田口義明</span> (Lacquerware), Kuwata Takuro <span class='ja'>桑田卓郎</span>, Ueba Kasumi <span class='ja'>植葉香澄</span>, and Masumoto Keiko <span class='ja'>桝本佳子</span> (Ceramics), and Mizuhashi Saori <span class='ja'>水橋さおり</span> and Komiya Yasuyoshi <span class='ja'>小宮康義</span> (Textiles).</p><p>The most notable pieces in the room were the pottery created by Masumoto Keiko. The Charizard and Charmander pots made sense being fire Pokemon. The Ninetales pot was especially interesting as the inside of the pot was brown and burnt like the Kantonian form, but the outside was glazed white, like the Alolan form. I liked her Moltres piece the most. Moltres appears by breaking out of an egg with flames. I think the other standouts in the room where all of the figures created by Ueba Kasumi, especially the Shaymin figure. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Kogei Catalogue</b></div><p>The best thing about every museum and museum exhibit in Japan is that the gift shop sells a book detailing each piece on display.

Underneath, there's another sign that says <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>, or <I>Kuma-don</I>, or a Bear Bowl, which would be a bowl of rice with bear meat. Nearly 6 years ago, I saw this sign as teachers and I were going exploring on our way to Kanazawa. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is <b>Takachiyo</b>, a restaurant that serves dishes made from the meat of local wildlife.</p><p>While the sign is very noticeable, its location is very out-of-the-way. It's about halfway between Takayama and Toyama along the highway, but it's about 10 minutes away from the highway exit. Most people from Takayama don't take the highway when going to Toyama because Route 41 has no tolls and takes the same amount of time. Route 41 goes a completely different direction through the mountains, so it never connects to the highway.</p><p>Here's the location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9" title="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9">https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9</a></p><p>Today, I went to Kanazawa, so on my return trip, I finally had the opportunity to visit the restaurant again.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides bear meat, the hunter that owns the restaurant, also traps deer and boar from the surrounding mountains. All of his dishes are prepared using local ingredients, including mountain vegetables, rice, and noodles. Soba noodles are hand-made from buckwheat grown by local people. </p><p>The menu mentions that killing animals for money is evil. However, we all live by consuming plants and animals. We must give thanks to them before each meal (and live together with them, in nature). This is the basic explanation of "Ittedakimasu," which is the 'grace' we all say before we eat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Five years ago, on my first visit to Takachiyo, I ordered their signature dish, the <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>. The bear meat was alright. It was tough and had a full taste, like beef. But, it also had a stringy-ness to it. Added with onions, eggs, and served on rice, it tasted delicious. </p><p>I went with some friends, and they ordered other dishes. One of my friends got some deer nabe. Nabe is a bit bowl of boiling broth with lots of vegetables and meat. It's similar to stew, but stew's main base is meat. Nabe's main base are the vegetables. Nabe is very weak in comparison. </p><p>The deer meat was alright. Japanese wild animals are much smaller compared with their American counterparts. They don't have gigantic bodies or gigantic muscles. As such, it didn't taste like venison I've had in the past. Again, more stringy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For my meal today, I ordered a Boar Bowl and Boar Udon. Boar was the one animal I hadn't tried last time, so I wanted to complete the triangle. The boar meat in both dishes was rough, like a flank steak. The meat itself had a dry texture, even though it was submerged in the Udon broth.</p><p>Overall, I would say that if you planned on going here to try exotic meats, you may leave disappointed. However, you would not be disappointed with the actual meals. While the meats themselves were just okay, the rice bowls and udon tasted excellent. Very good. Just good enough that I would recommend going out of the way to try and visit at least once.</p><p>There are plenty more things available on the menu than what I've ordered so far. He had English menus available to take, so I scanned it. Also, I still had a Japanese menu from the first time I visited.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Application for Permanent Residence" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/permanent-residence">Application for Permanent Residence</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 28, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over 10 years ago, I moved to Japan. I didn’t necessarily intend to stay for more than a year or two, but I loved living here and loved teaching students. Teaching had become the most rewarding job I’ve done in my life, so I didn’t want to leave, and it never felt like my time in Japan was complete. Now, this is where I live. A town full of students or parents of students that I’ve helped teach for more than 10 years. And full of friends and connections that I’ve made over the years.</p><p>Now that 10 years has passed, I can apply for Permanent Residence in Japan. In simple terms, Permanent Residence means that I no longer have to renew a work VISA after 3 years and I can buy or build a house. But to me, it means that I’m further established as a part of Japan and don’t intend to leave. It’s the near-equivalent to a Green Card in the US.</p><p>Applying for Permanent Residence is not a simple process of filling out a couple of forms. There are many parts to prove your legal employment, payment of taxes, and contribution to Japan. I spent about a month working on the application back in October, only to have it rejected because I hadn’t lived here a complete 10 years yet. Now, 4 months later, my application is complete and it ended up being 47 pages long.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230212_eiju/IMG_0507_t.webp"></a></p><p>It was so long that I wrote a Table of Contents describing everything that I included, and sectioned everything into different folders to make it as easy as possible for them to see what I’ve included.</p><p>Here are the table of contents.</p><p>0.      <b>Payment of Fee</b><br/>1.      <b>Application for Permanent Residence</b><br/>2.      <b>Photo</b><br/>3.      <b>Statement of Reason</b><br/>4.      <b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b><br/>5.      <b>Proof of Residence</b><br/>6.      <b>Proof of Employment</b><br/>7.      <b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b><br/>8.      <b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b><br/>9.      <b>Proof of Financial Assets</b><br/>10.    <b>Passport Photo</b><br/>11.    <b>Residence Card Photo</b><br/>12.    <b>Guarantor Information and References</b><br/>13.    <b>Proof of Contributions to Japan</b><br/>14.    <b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b><br/>15.    <b>Application Oath</b></p><p>The instructions for how to apply for permanent residence can be found on the government Immigration website. They are written in <a href="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.isa.go.jp/en/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">English</a> and in <a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/applications/procedures/zairyu_eijyu03.html">Japanese</a>. My table of contents follows the list of required materials from that page.</p><p>Even though, they have an English version that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s easy to figure out what to do. These instructions are machine translated, and you still need to understand what they’re saying in Japanese because of the specific names for forms, and the specific departments and locations you need to visit. There’s a lot of running around involved getting all the correct documents, so I have detailed everything I did to build my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Payment of Fee</b></div><p>0.      <span class='ja'>手数料</span><br/>This is not required when you submit your application, but it will be required after your application is successful. You must fill out the Payment form and attach an 8000<span class='ja'>円</span> revenue stamp to it. Revenue stamps can be purchased from the post office. Obviously, if you’ve been in Japan long enough, you already know how to do this from renewing your VISA.</p><p>Here’s the payment form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002847.pdf</a></p><div class='title'><b>Application for Permanent Residence & Photo</b></div><p>1.      <span class='ja'>永住許可申請書</span><br/>2.      <span class='ja'>写真</span><br/>The first document is the application itself. Again, from renewing a VISA, all the same information is here with the addition of a short version of why you want permanent residence, work history, and guarantor information. For my reason, I wrote "I wish to obtain permanent residence to continue teaching in Japan indefinitely and continue my study of kendo and Japanese culture to further enrich myself." It sounds like a lofty reason, but I have fully explained it in the next section.</p><p>Here’s the application form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002835.pdf</a></p><p>Additionally, you’ll need a 40mm x 30mm photo attached to your application.</p><div class='title'><b>Statement of Reason</b></div><p>3.      <span class='ja'>理由書</span><br/>Perhaps the part of this application that will take the longest is writing about why you want permanent residence in Japan. My short version stated that I wish to teach in Japan indefinitely and continue to learn about Japan, but those ideas are weak unless there is proof. In total, I wrote 3 pages about my time over the last 10 years.</p><p>I started with detailing my current responsibilities and accomplishments working at my high school: supporting English teachers in class, leading English writing classes, being an assistant Homeroom teacher, leading classes to prepare students for studying abroad, training students for speech contests and winning them, and teaching foreign exchange students Japanese language and culture.</p><p>Next, I detailed my accomplishments and responsibilities working in public elementary and junior high schools as part of the JET Programme, such as supporting English classes and training students for speech contests, but also volunteering in town for English conversations classes supporting the hospital and library, developing summer English camp and other events for students, and developing a full English curriculum for elementary schools.</p><p>Also, I detailed my responsibilities as a Regional Prefectural Advisory supporting other ALTs in my region and the prefecture by developing our biannual skills conferences and leading lectures and discussions about lesson planning and ideas, as well as lead monthly meeting for the ALTs in my town.</p><p>Finally, I closed my statement of reason with my contributions to the kendo federation in my town. I wrote about how I joined students in their club activities and practiced kendo, what I learned from doing kendo both personally and professionally, and eventually reaching the rank of 3-dan.</p><p>3 pages might have been too much for a statement of reason, but I wanted to completely show everything noteworthy that I’ve done in Japan. It was very direct and unemotional, focusing on the facts. My approach to writing the statement was very similar to writing a resume for an application. Overall, I don’t think the statement has to be completely emotionless, but I don’t think it should be the main focus of the argument. Show, don’t tell, as I say to my students.</p><p>Even though I wrote all this information in English, I had to rewrite everything in Japanese, too. I had some help with that. I included both English and Japanese versions of my statement in my application.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Identity</b></div><p>4.      <span class='ja'>身分関係を証明する次のいずれかの資料（該当しません）</span><br/>I am not Japanese, so this was not required for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Residence</b></div><p>5.      <span class='ja'>住民票</span><br/>Whenever you move somewhere in Japan, you must register at the town hall so it has a complete and up-to-date record of all of its residents. The application for permanent residence requires a print of this record. It was easy to get from my town’s registrar by filling out a request document and paying 300<span class='ja'>円</span> for them to print the record.</p><p>It has information, such as when you moved to town, current address, previous addresses, nationality, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Employment</b></div><p>6.      <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span><br/>In addition to proving that you live somewhere, you also need to prove that you work somewhere. This was pretty easy for me to get since my school is private and not that big. For a larger organization or a government organization, it might take some time for your request to go open the chain and for the document to come back down.</p><p>I just went to the office and they created a document that proved my employment. Depending on whichever company you work for, it may be an official document or it may not. I think it just needs to include a statement saying you work there as well as information that can be contacted later. My school/company just made up an official looking document with all the correct information on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Income and Tax Payment</b></div><p>7.      <span class='ja'>直近（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）の申請人及び申請人を扶養する方の所得及び納税状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Things start to get more complicated, as a single piece of paper proving your employment isn’t enough. Of course, you need to show that you’ve been paying taxes on the income that you’ve earned. And also show that you’ve been doing it for at least five years.</p><p>These documents include the <I>Kazei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>課税証明書</span> and the <I>Nozei shoumeisho</I> <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span>. Both documents translate as either Tax Certificate or Taxation Certificate, so looking at the English information about this section may not be helpful. Overall, the <I>Kazei</I> Tax Certificate details how much taxes you had to pay and what taxes you had to pay on your income within a given year. The <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate details the amount of taxes you still owe for a given year. Essentially, <I>Kazei</I> is like an itemized bill, and <I>Zozei</I> is the receipt.</p><p>Each document you’ll need for 5 years. For my town, I had a single <I>Kazei</I> Certificate for each year. For the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate, each year could be written on the same document. For each document, for each year, it cost 300<span class='ja'>円</span>. So for all the documents, my bill would’ve been 3000<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>However, <I>update</I>, when I initially turned in my application, I forgot to get 5 years for the <I>Nozei</I> Certificate. I was able to turn in my application, but I needed to mail in the correct form within two weeks. They gave me an envelope and a sheet that described the document I was missing. Another problem, though: my town only keeps the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate up to 4 years, instead of the 5 years they wanted. I called them, and they said 4 years was fine. So, my bill was actually 2700<span class='ja'>円</span> for these documents.</p><p>Additionally! There’s another version of the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate that is required. Besides the Tax Record office in city hall, I went to my town’s official Tax Office. Requesting the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate from them shows them I’ve paid all debts and taxes across all government departments and agencies, as well as never missed any payment for any bills or loan. This document cost 500<span class='ja'>円</span> to print.</p><p>In addition, to these tax documents, I had to include a photo of my bank book that proved I was getting paid the correct income.</p><p>So, for this section, I included the following documents:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>課税証明書（過去</span>５<span class='ja'>年分）</span>- Kazei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - Nozei Tax Certificate (5 years)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書（未払いの税金がないことを証明するためのパート</span>3<span class='ja'>）</span>- Nozei Cert proving no upaid taxes<br/>·        <span class='ja'>預貯金通帳（写し）</span>- Photo proving income.</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Pension Payments and Health Insurance</b></div><p>8.      <span class='ja'>申請人の公的年金及び公的医療保険の保険料の納付状況を証明する資料</span><br/>Now that I had shown that I am legally employed, getting legally paid, and responsibly paying taxes on my legal income, I need to show that I’m paying into either my company’s pension or the government’s pension for at least two years. Also that I have health insurance.</p><p>This section was somewhat difficult to follow. Initially, I just took a photo copy of my annual pension report that I had gotten in mail, but (<I>update!</I>) apparently that wasn’t enough. A few days after I turned in my application, I got a letter in the mail requesting another form. The form they wanted detailed all of my pension payments, and each pension that I’ve contributed to. It was called the <I>Hihokenja Chousho Shoukai Kaitou-hyou</I> <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span> or the “Insurance Record Inquiry Report,” I think? I’m not sure why it says insurance when its about pensions.</p><p>To get this form, I had to go to my town’s Pension office and request these forms. Prior to going to the office, I had some co-workers give them a call to make sure I was getting the right forms, and they were able to prepare everything for me before I arrived. It turned a possible 40-minute wait into 5 minutes. This document was also 500<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Looking at this document, I’ve contributed into a government pension when I worked for the city as a teacher, and I’ve contributed to a private pension I have with my current job. </p><p>The letter wanted me to include receipts from any contributions to the government’s individual pension service, but I never did that, so I didn’t have any.</p><p>For the health insurance card, I just took a photo of it and blacked out the account number.</p><p>So, this is what I included from this section:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>ねんきん定期便（写し）</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>被保険者調書照会回答票</span><br/>·        <span class='ja'>健康保険被保険者証（写し）</span></p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Financial Assets</b></div><p>9.      <span class='ja'>申請人又は申請人を扶養する方の資産を証明する次のいずれかの資料</span><br/>For the next part, I had to show all of Japanese financial assets. At minimum, I had to take photo copies of my bank statements to show how much money I have in Japan. I don’t have a house, so I didn’t have anything to show there. I do have a car, but I didn’t include any proof of that. Maybe I should have?</p><div class='title'><b>Passport Photo and Residence Card Photo</b></div><p>10.      <span class='ja'>申請人のパスポート（写し）</span><br/>11.      <span class='ja'>申請人の在留カード（写し）</span><br/>I included photo copies of my passport and residence card with my application, but this is not really necessary. When you turn in your application, you’ll need to also show them both of these, and they can take a photo copy themselves, at this time. I included these to save time.</p><div class='title'><b>Guarantor Information and References</b></div><p>12.      <span class='ja'>身元保証に関する資料</span><br/>A current Japanese citizen needs to vouch for who I am, what I stand for, and state that I would make a contribution to Japan by becoming a Japanese permanent resident. This person should be someone you know pretty well, and have a good relationship with. My principal at school has always sponsored my VISA, as well as other documents that required official clearance, so he was an easy choice as a guarantor.</p><p>They need to fill in the guarantor form and prove who they are. For my guarantor, we included the following:<br/>·        <span class='ja'>身元保証書</span> - the guarantor application<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証</span> - a photo copy of their ID (driver’s license, in this case)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>在職証明書</span> - proof of employment, wherever they work.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>納税証明書</span> - proof of tax payments. (<I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>住民票</span> - proof of residence.</p><p>Here’s the guarantor form:<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002536.pdf</a> (Japanese)<br/><a href="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf" title="https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf">https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/content/930002537.pdf</a> (English)</p><div class='title'><b>Contributions to Japan</b></div><p>13.      <span class='ja'>我が国への貢献に係る資料（</span>※<span class='ja'>ある場合のみで結構です。）</span><br/>This is the last meaty section of the application. For this section, I included my letters of recommendation and other certificates and awards of accomplishments. </p><p>In the end, I had 3 recommendation letters: one letter from the principal, one letter from the head of our English department, and one letter from head of the Kendo federation in my town. Each letter of recommendation talked about the contributions that I made to my school and kendo in town, and talked about why they think I should be awarded permanent residence.</p><p>Additional documents that I included were proof of things mentioned in either my Statement of Reason or their Letters of Recommendation. I included a photo of my kendo license showing participation for 10 years, my 3-dan diploma, and certificates of participation for 3 years in the international budo conference. I also included a photo of my driver’s license to show that not only do I have a license, but maintaining a perfect and safe driving record to be awarded a 5-year gold license.</p><p>All in all, here were my documents for this section.<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from principal)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from head of English)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>推薦状</span> – Letter of Recommendation (from Kendo Federation)<br/>·        <span class='ja'>剣道免許（写し）</span>- Kendo License Photo<br/>·        <span class='ja'>剣道</span>３<span class='ja'>段免許（写し）</span>- Kendo 3-dan Diploma<br/>·        <span class='ja'>国際武道文化セミナー</span> <span class='ja'>修了証</span> <span class='ja'>（</span>３<span class='ja'>年分）</span> - International Budo Conference particpation<br/>·        <span class='ja'>運転免許証（写し）</span>- Photo of Gold Driver’s License</p><div class='title'><b>Proof of Japanese Ancestry</b></div><p>14.      <span class='ja'>身分を証する文書等（該当しません）</span><br/>I’m not Japanese, so I did not need to do this. </p><p>I’m not sure if this one is proof of ancestry or identity, or what the difference is between part 4 above.

It doesn’t really seem like all that much once I finished making everything and putting it together. However, a lot of the time spent on the application is figuring out exactly what is required and where to go. The tax and pensions details are pretty tricky. I think my situation is pretty easy because I’ve only had the one job in the last 5 years, and the job is run by a professional organization. I also don’t have a house. Although, getting those documents probably aren’t too tough.</p><p>On February 13th, I drove up north to Toyama and turned in my application at Toyama Branch Office of the Nagoya Regional Immigration Bureau. A long time ago, I figured out that very few people actually go to this branch office, so the wait time is never more than 5 minutes. In Gifu, wait times can be as long as 45 minutes. And in Nagoya, a friend of mine waited for an hour and a half once.</p><p>Again, the clerk instantly noticed one probably with my application (the <I>Nozei</I> Tax Certificate not being 5 years), so I had to submit that afterward. I also got a letter in the mail on February 17th about the pension document. But, they accepted my application, and I’ve mailed those requested document as soon as I could. All documents were submitted as of February 21st, and I have not received any more letters about any more problems.  I think it’s all good!</p><p>Typically these application can take up to six months to be completely reviewed and responded to, but the clerk mentioned that it may only take three months to be complete. Over the last three years, thanks to Covid, the number of people moving to Japan has significantly decreased because the government shut down travel.  Previously, my VISA application would take 4 weeks to get approved, but it only took a week last year.</p><p>Hopefully, by May, I’ll get the postcard in the mail to come back down and get my card. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Overview of the Japanese Language" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/overview-of-the-japanese-language">Overview of the Japanese Language</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 20, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Coming from English, Japanese is one of the most difficult languages on learn. It's so difficult to learn because nearly every aspect of the language is different. The words, the grammar, the ideas, the culture, and the way Japanese is used all differ from English. </p><p>In fact, the U.S. Department of State's <a href="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/" title="https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/">Foreign Service Institute</a> classifies Japanese as a Category IV language, which requires a minimum of 2200 hours of class time (88 weeks of 5-hour daily training) to achieve a General Professional Proficiency level. It is the Institute's high ranking, shared only by Arabic, Chinese, and Korean.</p><p>The best way to learn Japanese, and any language, is to be immersed in the language. Have daily contact with the language, and try to find a balance of using all four or five methods of communicating with a language. These four methods are: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Sometimes, people break speaking into two methods: speaking written or prepared words and speaking your own improvised thoughts. Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing is also the order of difficulty of performing them.</p><div class='title'><b>Listening</b></div><p>By being in Japan, listening becomes a daily routine. However, it can be easy to shut everything out and ignore what it said around you. In your native country listening to your native language, you can hear and understand everything around you. You are part of the public consciousness. In a foreign country with a foreign language, you're no longer able to naturally understand everything. You have to work at it. And work is often exhausting, which makes it easy to tune out others.</p><p>There's a lot to understand, and it's possible that there's some things that you'll never understand. But, as time goes on, you will have the ability to understand some things, and be able to connect dots to understand things. If you get in the habit of tuning out others, you rob yourself of the ability to naturally understand your surroundings. So, don't tune out too much. Make attempts at understanding.</p><p>When you hear common phrases, or sometimes when people talk with you. Try repeating what they say. This may seem stupid, but this is how babies naturally begin to learn languages. Which, also may seem stupid for you. Of course, as adults, we can also learn the rules of the languages and compare them with our own language. The combination of these two things will allow use to learn the language.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>Listening becomes the easiest method of communication in Japan because you have so many passive opportunities to practice. Writing is the most difficult because you are not only outputting what you know of the language, but you have to activity do it to get better at it. It takes the most work and time out of the others.</p><p>Unlike English with its 26 letters (or 52, including both upper and lowercase alphabets), Japanese uses three sets of alphabets: Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Hiragana and Katakana have 46 characters each. Kanji, on the other hand, has over 10,000. Although, there are hundreds or thousands of kanji that are outdated. High School graduates are expected to know the most common 2,000. The Genki books only go through about 320.</p><p>All three of these alphabets are used together. Take a look at this sentence:</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span></p></p><p>The first two characters are <span class='ja'>ジム</span>, katakana. Katakana is almost exclusively used for foreign words in the Japanese language. Both Hiragana and Katakana are phonetic alphabets, so each of the characters have specific sounds that are said the exact same way wherever they are in the sentence, with a few exceptions. <span class='ja'>ジム</span> is my name, Jim, which is phonetically spelled.</p><p>The next two characters are <span class='ja'>先生</span>, kanji. In sentences, kanji are used for solid words, such as Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives. In this sentence, we have 3 words using kanji: <span class='ja'>先生</span>, <span class='ja'>店</span>, and <span class='ja'>行く</span>. <span class='ja'>先生</span> is <i>sensei</i>, or teacher. Combined with my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生</span>, it's used as a suffix to denote that I'm a teacher. Generally, non-casually, when referring to other people, you use a suffix with their name. <span class='ja'>店</span> is <i>mise</i>, or store. And, <span class='ja'>行く</span> is <i>iku</i>, or the verb, to go.</p><p>The other characters in the sentence (<span class='ja'>は</span>, <span class='ja'>に</span>, <span class='ja'>きます</span>) are hiragana. This is getting ahead of ourselves, but they are used in the sentence as particles and a conjugation. Using <span class='ja'>は</span>(wa) after my name <span class='ja'>ジム先生は</span> denotes that I'm the subject of the sentence. Using <span class='ja'>に</span>(ni) with shop <span class='ja'>店に</span> denotes the direction of the action. And, <span class='ja'>行きます</span>(ikimasu) is the present positive conjugation of the verb <span class='ja'>行く</span>, meaning to go.</p><p>Putting the meaning together: Jim goes to the store. (or Mr. Jim goes to the store.)</p><div class='title'><b>Hiragana and Pronunciation</b></div><p>Even though there are three writing systems, both katakana and kanji can be written in hiragana, which is the first alphabet we'll learn. Additionally, every hiragana character can be written in Alphabetic characters, which is where we'll start when learning words. This is called Romaji.</p><p>Let's go back to our sentence.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span><br/><span class='ja'>じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span><br/>jimu-sensei wa mise ni ikimasu</p></p><p>Looking at the sentence in Romaji can help with pronunciation. Each hiragana has a specific sound and pronunciation doesn't change based on spelling as in English. Here's all the Hiragana, with Romaji to the right.</p><p><div class="columns center"><div class="column"><span class='ja'>あ　い　う　え　お</span><br/><span class='ja'>か　き　く　け　こ</span><br/><span class='ja'>さ　し　す　せ　そ</span><br/><span class='ja'>た　ち　つ　て　と</span><br/><span class='ja'>な　に　ぬ　ね　の</span><br/><span class='ja'>は　ひ　ふ　へ　ほ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ま　み　む　め　も</span><br/><span class='ja'>や　　　ゆ　　　よ</span><br/><span class='ja'>ら　り　る　れ　ろ</span><br/><span class='ja'>わ　　　　　　を</span><br/><span class='ja'>ん</span></div><div class="column twoColumnLast">a <span class='ja'>　</span>i <span class='ja'>　</span>u <span class='ja'>　</span>e <span class='ja'>　</span>o<br/>ka<span class='ja'>　</span>ki<span class='ja'>　</span>ku<span class='ja'>　</span>ke<span class='ja'>　</span>ko<br/>sa<span class='ja'>　</span>shi<span class='ja'>　</span>su<span class='ja'>　</span>se<span class='ja'>　</span>so<br/>ta<span class='ja'>　</span>chi<span class='ja'>　</span>tsu<span class='ja'>　</span>te<span class='ja'>　</span>to<br/>na<span class='ja'>　</span>ni<span class='ja'>　</span>nu<span class='ja'>　</span>ne<span class='ja'>　</span>no<br/>ha<span class='ja'>　</span>hi<span class='ja'>　</span>fu<span class='ja'>　</span>he<span class='ja'>　</span>ho<br/>ma mi mu me mo<br/>ya<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yu<span class='ja'>　　　</span>yo<br/>ra<span class='ja'>　</span>ri<span class='ja'>　</span>ru<span class='ja'>　</span>re<span class='ja'>　</span>ro<br/>wa <span class='ja'>　　</span> <span class='ja'>　　</span>wo<br/>-n</div></div><br class="clr" /> </p><p>Speaking in terms of English pronunciation, the overall Japanese language is based on 5 vowel sounds with a combination of the above consonants. The vowel sounds do not change when paired with other characters.</p><p>Also, you may have noticed that ji, from my name <span class='ja'>じむ</span>, is not listed in the alphabet. There are certain characters that can take a <i>ten-ten</i> mark or a <i>maru</i> mark to slightly expand the alphabet. <span class='ja'>し</span>(shi) becomes <span class='ja'>じ</span>(ji).</p><div class='title'><b>Kanji and Readability</b></div><p>Note: Often students wonder, if you can write a sentence using only hiragana, a much less complex writing system, why ever use the other two? Why not write everything in hiragana.</p><p><p class="center"><span class='ja'>ジム先生は店に行きます。</span> vs.<span class='ja'>　じむせんせいは</span> <span class='ja'>みせに</span> <span class='ja'>いきます。</span></p></p><p>Coming from English, it makes sense to write everything using a limited number of characters, but the overall readability of the kanji sentence is far higher than the second. In fact, I added spaces in the hiragana sentence to improve its readability, but you still have to read each character to understand the words. The kanji sentence doesn't even need it.</p><p>While we don't use Kanji in English, the idea of using symbols to form a familiar shape representing a word is not so foreign. We've been reading and writing English since we were children, and one of the natural passive techniques we've developed is recognizing a word purely based on its shape. As long as the shape of the word fits the pattern we're used to, we can read and understand the word immediately without looking at each of the letters.</p><p>Kanji works the same way. Once you know the meaning of the kanji, you don't even have to read the whole sentence. Because there are so many kanji, much of a sentence's ambiguity is also removed. When I say, "light" without any context, do I mean something that shines on to a surface or something that's not heavy? Much like English, Japan has words written in Hiragana the same way with different meanings. But when using Kanji, the meaning is clear.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Again, learning Japanese is not a simple process. Just takes things step-by-step. Ask questions. Don't be afraid to make mistakes. And, always try.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/japan/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/japan">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
