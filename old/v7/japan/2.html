While it is much closer to the major cities of Nanto and Tonami than of the center of Toga village, it's still remote and daily travel was difficult beyond 50 years ago.</p><p>Takanuma itself is a small plateau, but the homes are hidden in the dense surrounding forest. The dense forest continues in all directions, and roads going in and out of the small area line sharp steep cliffs above the Toga river.</p><p>In 1902, a school was established in this small village. Today, the Takanuma Brach School still stands, although the current building was built in 1971. This was designated as a Class 2 Remote school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2564_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school opened to 52 students in 1902. That number doubled by 1930 to 105 students. However, by 1950, only 13 students still remained in the area and there were only 3 established households. </p><p>The school was closed in 1978, but still had life as a remote experience school. It was officially and completely closed in 1996. </p><p>This information comes from Heyaneko's reports:<br/><a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html</a><br/><a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1274" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1274">https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1274</a></p><p>And also from Haikyo Rider's tour of Toga Valley:<br/><a href="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html" title="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html">https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html</a></p><p>The Haikyo site has an entry, too:<br/><a href="https://haikyo.info/s/13492.html" title="https://haikyo.info/s/13492.html">https://haikyo.info/s/13492.html</a></p><p>The door was open in this small two-story building, so I put on my mask and went inside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2441_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The main floor seemed to mostly serve as living quarters for the remote teacher. There were dilapidated living quarters under the stairs. On the opposite side was a small room that was probably used as an office. The next room seemed like a science room. Or maybe this room was used as the teacher's office? I'm not quite sure. The "science" room had a safe, phone books, and other reference materials you wouldn't really find in a classroom.</p><p>The other rooms on the main floor were bathrooms, a kitchen, and a bathing room. It's interesting how all of the glassware, plates, and other kitchen utensils were simply left when the building closed. I think it's weird how the government just abandoned its belongings. Could they not have been used elsewhere? Or, if someone bought the building to live in, maybe they bought the building with everything in it?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, there were four rooms, but only two of them had chalkboards. In my experience, remote elementary schools tend to combine 1st and 2nd grade, 3rd and 4th, and 5th and 6th together as three homerooms total. I only count 3 chalkboards in the building. Maybe that downstairs science room was converted later. Or maybe, when they built this school building, they only needed to teach 5 or fewer children, so the school split them into two homerooms.</p><p>There weren't many remnants of a school on the top floor, though. The room to the right was completely open and lined with tatami mats. The middle room had an old wooden desk with some Japanese kanji drill books. And the store room in the middle room had cases of beer and sake. The open tatami room was mostly liked used as a banquet drinking room for the remaining adults in the village.</p><p>The other room on the left had a table and some comfortable seeting. It was probably last used as a meeting room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much of the paint looked like it was rotting away and peeling on the wall. The curtains were tattered and thin, weakened from being baked in the years of hot sunlight. Floor tiles no longer adhered to the ground. Ceiling tiles also showed spots of water damage, and some hung a bit low.</p><p>Everywhere was covered in dust, dirt, and animal droppings in some spaces. But, there weren't any smells. And it wasn't overly dusty in the air. However, even though I was wearing a mask, about a week later I had a terrible cough and lost my voice for a day. Another nearby branch school was demolished due to asbestos detected throughout the building, so maybe I got poisoned? It took me nearly a month to recover. I thought I was already careful with my mask, gloves, and washing up after getting home, but maybe it wasn't enough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takanuma Branch School lies on Hwy 471 connecting all the neighborhoods of Toga Valley from the main village down to Tonami and Nanto. The school is clearly visible. The rest of the neighborhood is not.</p><p>There's a road in front of the school leading into the forest where the old residents lived. I found an open area that was completely empty. It could have had a home that was removed. I did find another home that had collapsed and was crushed under years of heavy snow. There didn't seem to be anything inside.</p><p>This was what remains of Takanuma today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2593_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Further down the road, this is what it looks like from the outside. You can see a road on the right, but the mountain and forest completely absorbs the road on the right. The whole right area doesn't even look like it's ever been touched by humans. Yet, up and down the rivers of these valleys are small pockets of where humans lived hundreds of years ago.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Abandoned Sorei Settlement 草嶺集落" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/abandoned-sorei-settlement">Abandoned Sorei Settlement 草嶺集落</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Every city, town, and village had their centralized schools, but in the mountains and valleys, daily travel was nowhere near as easy as it is today.</p><p>In the 5 valleys of southwestern Toyama, known as Gokayama <span class='ja'>五箇山</span>, the area was split into 3 villages. The central-most village, Taira village, had two elementary schools, Shimonashi ES and Higashi Nakae ES. Higashi Nakae Elementary School was first established back in 1873 during the Meiji restoration. </p><p>I'm not really sure what the people in these mountain valleys did for education before then. Probably nothing. Probably no need as the children would grow up into farmers like everyone else in their home and village. And even with this elementary school established, there were other more rural pocket settlements further up and down the mountain and river who couldn't attend the school, especially in winter.</p><p>After World War II, with more money given to education, the government began building many many branch schools for the centralized schools. The Sugio Branch School was one such school. The full title of the school was <span class='ja'>平村立東中江小学校杉尾分校</span> or Tiara Village Higashi Nakae Elementary School - Sugio Branch School. </p><p>The Sugio neighborhood was only 5 kilometers north up the river, but it was on the other side of that river and there were no bridges. If students were to join school, they would have to travel by boat. So, the government built a branch school for the few students living in Sugio.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm not exactly sure when the school opened, but Sugio Branch school had its own branch school, <a href="/old/v7/donohara-winter-branch-school" title="/donohara-winter-branch-school">the Donohara Winter Branch School</a>. That school was completed in 1957, so the main branch must've been completed before. Both schools operated for less than 20 years before they were closed in March 1972. The reasons for closure were a combination of further rural depopulation in Japan and advances in transportation. Paved roads, bridges, tunnels, and snow sheds now connected most areas of Gokayama allowing for smooth daily travel. Schools had busses that could pick up the dozen or so students remaining in these pocketed areas.</p><p>After its closure as a school, the Sugio Branch School continued to operate as a nature experience center. During summer, it seems like nearly all the older elementary students in the village visited the school to learn about woodworking and craftsmanship.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's crazy how many children are in this photo compared to the population of the area today. This photo doesn't have a date, but I would guess it was the late 70s or early 80s. Since then, all the branch schools in Taira had closed, and Shimonashi ES and Higashi Nakae ES combined in 1999 to form Taira ES. 5 years later, municipal mergers were enacted across Japan and all areas of Gokayama merged with Nanto City. Taira ES was combined in Kamitaira ES in 2004.</p><p>Today, I would guess that the entire student population of Kamitaira ES is about the same or less than the number of students (maybe only sixth graders?) in the above photo.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After a while, the building was designated as a community center.

Among the equipment was a PA system, some crafts, and the old signboards for the school.</p><p>Going back downstairs, underneath the staircase was a kitchen that was fully stocked with glassware, silverware, and other kitchen attire that could be used to host an enkai (drinking party). The eldery members of this now small neighborhood probably used the building to get together every year, talk about happenings, and then have a party afterward. (All organizations and communities do this in Japan.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were glasses in the drying rack, which seemed like people were still probably using the kitchen. There was a lot of firefighting equipment near the entrance, so maybe the volunteer firefighters used the sink for water after doing drills.</p><p>The kitchen is one of the oldest parts of the building. While all schools have their own kitchens, branch schools were unique in that homeroom teachers would live in the buildings. Just as weather would make it dangerous for students to travel to the main school, it would be dangerous for teachers to make the trek to the branch school each day. So, while the branch school was in use, the teacher would live there.</p><p>There was a 5-point scale used to determine the remoteness of a branch school. This grading was determined by how difficult travel would be to a grocery store, post office, and other social facilities. Each full point on the scale added a bonus factor to the teacher's salary for the time they had to live in the school.</p><p>Sugio wasn't too far away from the main village, so it was probably rated as a 2 or 3 at best.</p><p>Next to the kitchen were the bathrooms. They seemed slightly newer than the kitchen, so I think they were converted at one point. This is probably where a bath was for the teacher living here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going down the hall there was a really clean room.

It is one of the first villages along the Otani Valley, part of the five valleys of the area. After the village designations of the late 1800s, it became part of Toga Village, which is kinda weird, but maybe not.</p><p>The whole area of southwest Toyama is split into five major valleys. Toga Valley is the eastern-most one, with Otani Valley directly to the west. All of these valleys are very long and winding. Today, it takes about 30 minutes to reach the center of Toga Village from the valley base by car. It takes about 10 minutes from the same location to reach Shimohara going down the Otani valley.</p><p>I don't know how they expected these students to travel the distance back to the valley base and trek 3-times the distance up another valley to reach school each day.</p><p>Well, the government must've thought the same way because in 1935 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>10 they built a branch school in the center of this village, titles <b>Toga Element School - Shimohara Winter Branch School</b> <span class='ja'>利賀小学校下原冬季分校</span>. Apparently, roads were established enough for students to make the trip outside of winter. When the school was built they were 16 students. Later in 1973 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>48, it became an all-year branch school before closing in 1986 <span class='ja'>昭和</span>61.</p><p>This was according to research done by <a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs14.html">Heyaneko</a>. Much like other school buildings in the distant old villages of Toga Valley, some people began living in the building for a time. But, the building had been completely vacant for about 20 years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1838_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, it's gone. Google Maps still shows the building being there, but it's using imagery from May 2024. So, it must've been demolished last year. Many of these old buildings used a lot of asbestos, so with no one maintaining them, they've become an incredible danger and must be removed.</p><p>I took some photos of the empty lot, and went up the hill to visit the village's shrine.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1860_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the Shimohara Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'>下原八幡宮</span>. Hachiman Shrines are dedicated to the Shinto god Hachiman. He is apparently a god of archery and war, so he was a favorite god of many samurai. Many farmers and fisherman also pray to Hachiman for a bountiful harvest or a bountiful amount of fish in their nets.</p><p>This shrine was a bit unique as the Shishi Lion statues out front looked very stunted compared to ones I've seen at other shrines. Maybe these statues were the original ones from hundreds of years ago, never refreshed or reformed.</p><p>The shrine itself was protected by a wall of plexiglass surrounding the entire building. The front could be opened to enter, pray, and give your offering.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_16_shimohara/IMG_1903_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This small pocket of civilization seems pretty representative of the many villages that dot these valleys. People often refer to them as islands because of how isolated they can be. Shimohara is pretty representative of this as the walls of the valley are so steep there's really nothing around except for the next pocket village down the road 10 minutes or back up the road for 10 minutes.</p><p>It's obviously easy to travel to all these village today with the roads and tunnels carved out of the mountains. But these roads have only been established since after the war in the 60s and 70s. 100 years ago, people were probably only traveling to these villages by boat.</p><p>People still live in Shimohara today. There were four homes, and had their cars parked nearby. With the concrete school building gone, the area feels like its gotten closer to nature again.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/abandoned-oshiba-settlement">Abandoned Oshiba Settlement 押場集落</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was small enough and close enough to another village that I don't think anyone considered in an actual village. Thus, it was given the designation of shuraku <span class='ja'>集落</span> instead of mura <span class='ja'>村</span>. </p><p>At its height, it seems like there were 10 homes clustered together with 100 people liviing there. This was during the Meiji period. In the year 2000, no one was registered as living here. Japanese Blogger Akirango visited <a href="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121" title="https://akiranngo.hateblo.jp/entry/2020/05/16/193121">the area in 2020</a>, and did a lot of research on the old village.</p><p>When he visited in 2020, there were apparently several homes in the area. Most of them had been completely abandoned and several had collapsed or were on the brink of collapsing. He noted that one home looked like some folks still returned every now and then to check on it. <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Toga_Oshiba.html">Mr. Murakage</a> also visited the village in 2011. His page shows the population of the village since 1872 (Meiji 5).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1769_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, anyone who still owned land in Oshiba must've died or sold it to the government because the construction companies have moved in and begun cutting down the forest surrounding the village. Google Maps doesn't show any of this, but it's using satellite images from May 2024. So all this deforestation happened last summer or this summer.</p><p>Also, looking on Google Map, the road leading to the village has had some changes in the last year, too. The village road branches off from Route 471 leading to the center of Toga Village. Near the crossing, the road had been taken out by a landslide, and construction crews have been building a new support bridge going from the main road down to the village area.</p><p>So, maybe they started cutting down trees last year, and the road was taken out over winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1726_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the most important construction related projects in the area is the Toga Dam. Apparently, they've been working on this dam for almost 20 years. Looking looking at various old posts of people exploring the villages and schools in the area, looking through Google Maps, and also going there, it seems they area is full of construction from summer to fall.</p><p>Open areas have temporary dorms set up for workers. The road-side stop <span class='ja'>道の駅</span> further north on 471 had several billboards targetted at workers. It says how to avoid heatstroke while working in summer, and how it's okay to stop working if you feel too hot. The occasional truck or marked cars are parked along Route 471, too.</p><p>It seems like they could be clearing the forest for something related to the dam.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1761_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While all the homes seemed to have been removed, the Shinmei Shrine <span class='ja'>神明宮</span> was still there, left untouched for now. Shinmei Shrines are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture was important.</p><p>In his post, Akirango wondered what the shrine would say about the history of its village, both the rise and the fall. I don't think anyone would have considered Oshiba a vibrant village. But even so, I suppose the shrine would have gotten lonely with its residents slowly moving away.</p><p>The nearby <a href="/old/v7/kitamamedani-branch-school" title="/kitamamedani-branch-school">Kitamamedani Branch School</a> used to have a winter branch school in Oshiba. It's full title was Toga Elementary Kitamamedani Branch School - Oshiba Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校北豆谷分校押場冬季分校</span>. It opened in 1930 (Showa 2) and closed in 1968 (Showa 43), which is also when the Kitamamedani branch school closed. In 1943, it apparently had 11 students.</p><p>Would the shrine feel sad that children were no longer around? Or happy that they've found a more lucrative life elsewhere? Would the shrine feel sad that the remains of the town had been removed? Or happy that the area had become lively again with activity?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_15_oshiba/IMG_1744_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The outside of the shrine looked like it was pretty well intact. However, the inside didn't look so great. Much of the walls showed signs of termites. Ceiling boards looked like they were peeling and melting away. With absolutely no one in the area now returning, the shrine doesn't seem like it's going to survive many more winters.</p><p>The was a painting of Nagoya Castle on the wall. There were also samurai horse paintings on the wall facing outwards. These are pretty similar to <a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">Ema Paintings</a> in Hida. By facing outwards, the luck and protection is extended to the people and happenings outside of the building.</p><p>Eventually (probably in the not so distant future), the shrine will be gone and very little trace of the Oshiba settlement will remain. Only the photos and stories of those who've been here.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamimomose-branch-school">Kamimomose Branch School 上百瀬分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Its full name was Toga Village Sakaue Elementary Sakaue Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀村立坂上小学校坂上分校</span>.</p><p>Sakaue Elementary was only a few kilometers north along the river. So today, it feels like a huge waste to have a whole branch of the school for students just down the road. But, back when the branch school was used, there were no school busses, and the roads were often completely drowned in meters of snow from the mountain valley.</p><p>It was difficult finding information about this school. I learned of it from watching <a href="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=2481" title="https://www.tkc.pref.toyama.jp/video/eizou/detail.aspx?record_id=2481">this video on Toyama's website</a>. 15 years ago, Toyama Prefecture did a retrospective series about the wooden schools of the past that were still standing. I'm not sure why, but other Haikyo explorers did not go here.</p><p>The video shows glimpses of an old map that marks locations of the area. So, I thought it would also mark the true location of this school. I could not find the map's location on Google Maps, so I went to the area to snoop around for it. After going to the nearby temple, the map was posted on the side of the road nearby.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1375.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1375_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was the exact same map from the video, but worn and weathered after 15 years. Also, it did not mark the location of any school. Thinking it was along the driving path through the woods, I got in my car and went east. However, just up the road, I saw it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1383.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1383.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1383_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1383_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1383_t.webp" /></a></p><p>A wooden deshelved building, covered in vines, windows broken, and still standing for some reason. It was next to the <span class='ja'>利賀村高齡者生産活動センター</span>, or the Toga Village Senior Citizen Activity Center.</p><p>The door to the school was open, and broken off of its hinges, so I went inside and took a bunch of photos. The building had been repurposed after the school closed, but many of its school features were still present, such as the low sinks in the bathroom, the coat rack along the entrance, and the numbers on each stair going to the second floor.</p><p>I didn't realize it until after coming out of the bathrooms, but the building was infested with bats. One or two them were startled and began flying around because of my pressence. I think they were mostly harmless though? I was wearing a mask so I was (probably) protected from whatever diseases could come from their feces.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1437_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1437_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1437_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1437_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1437_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs revealed the remnants of the business that last used the building. Any classroom walls had been removed to create a wide open space. In the corner, piles of boxes were left containing various threads and clothing materials. Scattered on the ground were work orders and instructions for creating women's undergarments. </p><p>Apparently the school was used as a textile shop for ladies underwear? So weird.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1449.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1449_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1449_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1449_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There was a calendar on the wall from 1996, so its possible the building was abandoned 30 years ago. This is somewhat consist with other schools and buildings in the area.</p><p>There is a saying when hiking and exploring, "take only photos, leave only footprints." Don't steal anything. Don't disturb anything. Don't destroy. However, I did find a book amonst the garbage.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1471.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1471.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1471_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1471_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1471_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is an anniversary book commerating Toga Junior High School. Inside contains the history of schools in Toga valley complete with photos and detailed information. I took this book as it will help me find more schools in the area, and compare the past with the present. Eventualy, I will clean it up a bit and scan it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1502.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1502.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1502_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1502_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_09_sakaue/IMG_1502_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's pretty impressive how long the building has held together. Many other 80-year-old buildings have completely collapsed from years of heavy snow. I suppose being so close to the senior center has its benefits. Those eldery townspeople probably remember going to this school and want to try and preserve it as best they can. Although, these days, it seems like the building's only use is a shelter for firewood.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tanoshima Shinmei Shrine 田ノ島神明宮" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tanoshima-shinmei-shrine">Tanoshima Shinmei Shrine 田ノ島神明宮</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The site of the village is along the Toga River going south up the mountain from Sakaue village. It's between the villages of Abetto and Taikanba.</p><p>A branch school was opened in the village for its children. In 1959, there were 16 students. But the school was closed 6 years later. Perhaps this was because many of the younger families moved away or because a bus service could be established between the village in Sakaue village nearby. The concrete branch schools in the area were built in the 1970s, so this building would've been made out of wood.</p><p>In 2013, <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134">Hayaneko</a> visited the village and only 2 houses remained, with one of the houses actually being lived in.

Apparently meals are more than 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> a plate.</p><p>The side road continues past the restaurant into the forest, and eventually ends with the forest engulfing the road. I wasn't paying attention to the map, so I didn't realize that I went past the shrine quite a while ago. Going back to the restaurant, the shrine is located up on the hill behind the area. You can see it from the road peering through the trees.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Shinmei Shrines <span class='ja'>神明宮</span> are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture is most important.</p><p>Throughout Toga Valley and many rural areas, it's pretty easy to find Shinmei Shrines, as their yearly festivals pray to the gods for an abundant harvest.</p><p>With no one left in the village, I'm not really sure who maintains this shrine. Inside the shrine, a plaque showing the names of all the Shinto priests lies on its side, and hasn't been updated in years. Perhaps the folks running the restaurant keep up the old rituals.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Senzoku Branch School 千束分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/senzoku-branch-school">Senzoku Branch School 千束分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It is located in the Toga valley deep into the mountains continuing along the thinner and thinner Toga River. It is 12km away from the heart of Toga Village, which doesn't seem too far by today's standards, but 80 years ago in the depth of winter, you could only travel there by foot.</p><p>It was first opened in 1935 to 15 students who lived in the Taikanba neighborhood. The full title was <span class='ja'>利賀村立坂上小学校大勘場分校</span> or Toga Village Sakagami Elementary School Taikanba Branch School. In 1976, when Sakagami ES merged with Toga ES, it was renamed to <span class='ja'>利賀小学校奥大勘場分校</span> or Toga Elementary School Oku-Taikanba Branch School. At this time, the Taikanba neighborhood had grown to 35 students living in 8 households. (I'm not sure how that works.) With advancements in infrastructure, automobiles, and a further depopulation of the area, the branch school was closed in 1996.</p><p>The school was designated as a Grade 4 Remote School, nearly Grade 5, the highest rank. These ranks are given based on distances away from grocery stores, post offices, and general daily amenities. While travel was impossible, teachers lived in these remote schools, never leaving for weeks or possibly months at a time. Their salaries were increased by a factor based on this grade.</p><p>This information comes from Heyaneko's reports: <br/><a href="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html" title="http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html">http://heyaneko.web.fc2.com/zs24.html</a><br/><a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1059" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1059">https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=1059</a></p><p>Haikyo Rider also did a report: <br/><a href="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html" title="https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html">https://ameblo.jp/hiho-haiko/entry-11934259064.html</a></p><p>The Haikyo site also has an entry for this place:<br/><a href="https://haikyo.info/s/15544.html" title="https://haikyo.info/s/15544.html">https://haikyo.info/s/15544.html</a></p><p>I visited in early summer 2025. These guys visited in 2014 and 2017. The Haikyo site went there in 2021.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1044_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's interesting looking at the differences between my photos and theirs. The building itself really hasn't changed. According to Heyaneko, 10 years ago, an old woman was living in this building. Apparently, it was possibly to rent these old schools as a place to live for a while. Now, she's gone and apparently a construction company uses it for storage.</p><p>The branch school acts as an entrance way to the now abandoned neighborhood of Taikanba. Going up the street behind the school leads to the neighborhood and where the homes used to be. In Heyaneko's post and the Haikyo's post, they show a home in increasing states of decay.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1075_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For me, this home had completely collapsed, crushed under the weight of each year's snowfall. I searched through the rubble a little bit and found some old TVs and magazines. Maybe the construction company used this home as a place to rest after the owners moved away or passed away.</p><p>While the area seemed largely abandoned, there was a shrine further up the road that was in pretty good condition.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the area's Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'>八幡宮</span>. The area around the shrine was overgrown, but not so much that is was choking out this building. The road coming from the branch school was all cleared and open. The shrine's building was still strong. The inside was clean and maintained. Someone was still coming out here. Maybe some of the residents of the old neighborhood are still around.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1198_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The only other building still standing in the area was a small fireman's garage. The building was still sound, even though the edges of the roof had been creased and bent from years of heavy snow. The electrical wiring leading from the poles to the building had snapped, so they hung low over the road.</p><p>Looking inside the garage, there was some fire equipment, but also a motorcycle and a moped. There were a few other things not related to fire fighting, so I think some people were using the garage as general storage before they left.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_05_okudaikanba/IMG_1166_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unlike other abandoned villages and schools in the valleys of Gokayama, this neighborhood feels like it serves no purpose. It's not a remote stop on the way to a larger village center. There's some space out here, but there aren't any vast fields for farming. I don't think the area was really renowed for anything. It doesn't really seem like there's any reason for anyone to live out here.</p><p>I suppose the settlers must've broken away from the people in the villages further in to get away from them and try to establish something for themselves.</p><p>Either way, I think it's very difficult to imagine a life out here. Prior to the 1960s, once the snow fell in October or November, you weren't leaving until March or April. Your whole summer was spent farming the food that would eat for the year until the next harvest. The river probably didn't have an abundance of fish as villages down the river would get most of them. Hunting was probably good, but enough to sustain everyone?</p><p>Somehow they managed for the time they lived here.
