I'll show Gage some of the nifty sight-seeing places like the Atomic Bomb epicenter, Peace Park, probably the Museum too.  We'll probably hit Beardo.  On Tuesday, we'll probably do more of the same but do far more shopping.</p><p>On Wednesday, Ikuko took the day off, so we'll head up to Sasebo to meet her.  I want to check out Hirado castle, which is a little north of Sasebo, and also other places around there where we could find more Sakura ^_^.  We'll spend the night in Sasebo somewhere, probably Cybac or a Karaoke box or something.  Maybe Ikuko has some room at her place.</p><p>On Thursday, we'll head back to Nagasaki but take make some stops in Towns on the way back, like Omura and Isahaya.  Hopefully, Hilary will get back to me about this Italian place, and we'll have some Pizza in Nagayo, too.</p><p>On Friday, we'll head back to Fukuoka and do much much shopping around town.  We didn't really spend a lot of time in stores yesterday, so this'll be the day to make up for that.</p><p>Early Saturday morning is our flight back to the states. :/</p><p>There you have it ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mitsuwa's Bon Odori Festival" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mitsuwas-bon-odori-festival">Mitsuwa's Bon Odori Festival</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, Mitsuwa had their annual Bon Odori Dancing festival.  The Bon festival is typically the festival of the dead that which citizens remember their loved ones.  Nagasaki has a pretty elaborate Bon festival that spans 3 days.  One of the shrines from Suwa Shrine is brought down to the Harbor where it is clearly visible for the spirits to gather and collect amongst the living.  Loved ones can go to the Harbor and see their loved ones who had died over the past year.  On the third day, loved ones light a candle in a little paper boat and send it down the river to guide the spirit through the River Styx.</p><p>Something like that anyways..  This was one festival, I wish I was still over there to see.  Bon festivals take place towards the end of Summer.  Typically sometime between the end of July and the beginning of September.  Nagasaki's Bon festival takes place in the middle of august.  Around the same time, St. Paul, Minnesota also celebrates Nagasaki's Bon festival, since they are "sister cities," which makes it a great excuse to go home and visit my parents.</p><p>Anywho.. Mitsuwa changes this a little bit by adding 'Odori', which is 'to dance.' Mitsuwa's Bon Odori festival was more of the celebration of life, than the remembrance of the dead.  I wonder what region this change originated from.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" /></p><p>Mitsuwa had a pretty damn big turnout.

No squid on a stick, though :/</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" /></p><p>The real show was the stage outside in the parking lot.  They switched off between traditional japanese stuff, and uninspired contests.  They had Chicago's professional Taiko Drummasters, and Chicago's Okinawan dancers.</p><p>I was really disappointed they didn't have Soran and Yosakoi.  These were the two traditional dances that Maki, Mika, Natchan, and Mayu taught us foreigners.  Perhaps, in one years time, I will assembled a Soran team of my own and bring this time honored tradition to Mitsuwa.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun.  It was really cute to see so many kids having a great time, and it was great seeing everyone in a festival type mood.</p><p>They really need more food vendors and parlor games to bring the essence of a japanese festival to life, though.  I guess too many people have real jobs.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Amperos" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/amperos">Amperos</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Fucking Amperos.. yet another late night venture ruined by insecurity</p><p>Amperos is an 8 story all-girls dormatory which lies at the bottom of the mountain that Gaidai sits atop of. Gaidai being short for Nagasaki Gaigokokugo Daigaku, which is japanese for Nagasaki Foreign Language University. Through some sorrid twist of fate, they put the girls dormatory right next to the school, but the guys dorm is a mile or two away.</p><p>One year, some guy started harassing some girls and tried to break in through the front. I mean, come on.. who wouldn't right? So, they erected a 7 foot fence circling the perimeter to keep the old perverts out of there.</p><p>That wasn't enough for another old guy, since he just went over the fence and then was free to harass. Steps had to be taken.. They lined their 1 foot thick concrete fences with 2 inter-weaving lines of barbed wire. But only along the landlocked portion of the perimeter.</p><p>Since Amperos is near the bottom of the mountain, its' north side hugs the road the continues up the mountain to gaidai. This has been easy to climb up and jump over before. The south face over looks the mountain as it continues down into a ravine. The drop is about 5 or 6 stories into the runoff river below. So, they must've figured that no one would get in that way.</p><p>This was still an invitation for some guys, who have tried to scale that muddy rock wall to reach the fence and climb right on in. I don't know if they put barbed wire along the south wall yet.</p><p>I think all this over security just breeds challenge for those uninvited. Its not possible to ever be 100% secure. The illusion of all this safety really just puts a big spotlight on yourself.</p><p>Anyways, needless to say, they are pretty strict about the 'girls only' rule. Each person entering the building is greeted by an orderly who stands watch during the hours when Amperos is open. Girls must return to Amperos by 10p or 11p depending on the night or else they are locked out for the evening. I guess they can't pay someone to be at the post 24 hours.</p><p>This whole thing really screws them over when they want to go out for the night to a bar and drink until whenever they've had enough. More over, it screws up a guys night when he wants his friends to join him at beardo. Much like last night.. Of course, the night probably would've been fine if i still had a room at the guy's dorm :/.. oh well</p><p>This is how last night ended.. Hoping a bus back downtown to five's place, getting some sleep and watching Fugitive 2 on the movie channel.</p><p>Overall yesterday was quite fun. I met up with mennat, natalie, miho and tina for dinner. 3 of which live in Amperos.</p><p>I ran into a couple random friends, too. A chinese guy from the forms and a chinese girl from the dance club. Both pretty surprised to see me. My chinese pal's first words to me, after asking why i was here was, "wahh, you're fat".. thank you.. at least someone said what had been on my mind for the past couple weeks. "Americans like to eat a lot of meat," he said, "its so cheap." I love non-westerner simplistic honesty..</p><p>"yeah.. that and i hardly get any exercise, eat fast-food a little too often, and have been developing a fatty recipe for about two months," i replied. Hmm... well there are 3 easy things i can change about my current lifestyle right off the bat.</p><p>Maybe i'll also try utilizing Madison's metro system as an excuse to use my legs for a change. Then again, i'll probably get back and just say fuck it. Its earie how easy it is to be lazy in America. If fast food was healthier, in general, the whole population would start to become just a little bit healthier, in general. It sucks, because all the healthy food in America either tastes bad, takes preparation, or too expensive. Blah blah blah..</p><p>Yesterday also marked plenty of video game shopping. Almost too much, actually..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Back to Japan" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/back-to-japan">Back to Japan</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This is the third attempt for the US Treasurery to get rid of the paper dollar and use something a bit more solid.  With good cause too.  According to <a href="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/5853746.html" title="http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/5853746.html">this article</a> the average life span of a dollar bill is about 2 years.  The dollar bill is a frail piece of paper that get used over and over and over again.  The bills are torn apart during their lifetime, and must be replaced.  Any coin pretty much lasts forever.</p><p>I wonder why the dollar coin hadn't worked before.  Maybe it's because it wasn't widely adopted so those with a dollar coin couldn't use it in it's most convience places, like vending machines and parking meters.  There's also the psychological barrier of switching something so standard in our lives.</p><p>Well, i think about how money is generally used in Japan.  Over there, they have coin currency up to 500 yen, or $5.  Their standard lowest paper money is the 1000 yen note, or $10 bill.  You'd think having more coins, would mean having more change to lug around all day long, but it's quite the opposite.  When your coins have more value, you keep track of them a little better because of their worth, but also because you're using these coins whenever you pay for something.  If you buy something for 425, you'll be reaching in your pocket for a 500 coin anyways, why not grab all your change and whiddle the excess down at the same time.</p><p>After we ran our food stand at the festival, we sold our tacos for 250 yen.  An easy 3 coin purchase.  So..  after we had our profits it was almost all coin.  I changed up all the coinage for bills with my own money.  I ended up having so many coins i couldn't even carry.  But, each day i would grab a hand full, and stuff my little coin pouch and attempted to see what i could get rid of.</p><p>Very few places in Japan take credit card..

| February 6, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>... are pretty slick.  Japanese society is a rather mobile one.  Adults usually work all day, and Kids are usually at school all day.  Even when they aren't at their places of business or work, they usually aren't home.  The Japanese usually conglomerate somewhere in the town, rather than each other's homes.  Therefore, they need something to keep them connected with all their friends and business associates.  This is why cell phones are so grand in Japan.  If you don't have one, then you must be tied to a phone somewhere or a computer somewhere to keep in contact with your friends to figure out what's up.  You'd be stuck in your tiny apartment or house waiting for something to happen, rather than walking around the town getting something done.  This is also why the Japanese people leap until mobile technology faster than in the US.</p><p>The Japanese use their cell phone as their primary communications device.  More Japanese connect to the Internet through their phone, than on a computer, and more Japanese send emails back and forth from their phone, rather than calling each other.  Whether on a train, on a bus, or just walking, you can easily see most pedestrians typing away with one hand on their cellphone.</p><p>Since cellphones are so widely used, the market for making phones is probably the largest technological market in Japan.  If you walk into any electronic department store, you'll be bombarded with their cellphone area almost right away.  There are 3 main cellphone companies in Japan: DoCoMo, Soft Bank, and Au.  Their stand-alone stores are almost just as common as convenience stores.</p><p>The phone company i went with was Soft Bank, and purely because of their options.  I was looking for a prepaid phone, so that limited my choices to Au and Soft Bank right away.  Now these companies don't have prepaid only models.  They have prepaid plans that can go on specific models.  These plans usually nerf all but a few options for the phone.  The prepaid plan for the Au phones nerf almost all the options, and only allow the user to email other Au users.  The prepaid plan for Soft bank phones pretty much did the same, except allowed emailing to any email address.  Well that narrowed down the choices pretty fast.  So i got a slick looking Soft Bank phone.</p><p>Anywho...  each store has a vast variety of different cellphones you can choose from.  Some vary in options, but every single cellphone is complete with the internet, emailing, and an infrared sensor.  Most phones have cameras, and most phones have marginally large hard-drives for playing mp3s.  Another such model actually has an antenna  for catching TV receptions.</p><p>Whenever you come across some poster advertisement in Japan, you'll probably notice a square barcode like design printed with it.  Well, that's just one of the many uses of the infrared sensor.  You can set the sensor to capture, and point your phone at this barcode.  The barcode acts as a URL when it's received by your phone, and will automatically bring you to a website from the advertisement.</p><p>McDonalds makes full use of this technology by stamping one on each of it's product's wrappers.  You can scan the wrapper's barcode, and it'll bring you to a webpage detailing the nutritional information of what you're eating.  pretty handy.</p><p>The other main use of the infrared sensor is to send contact information back and forth between other cellphones.  This skips the whole process of asking what someone's phone number is, and then tediously typing it into your phone.  The sender can just send the info across infrared and the receiver can capture this information effortlessly.</p><p>In Japan, my cellphone and a pocket map were my two main pieces of equipment (besides id and money) in order to get around and do things without being tied down to anywhere.</p><p>___</p><p>In contrast, American phones are so damned primitive.  It's like beating two rocks together to make fire.  Of course, we don't need anything so helpful in our society because we're usually home.  You could just call their house.  With cellphones, in America, now you can call the person directly, but you wouldn't want to email said person, because they are more than likely driving around since everything is so far apart.  Internet?  That's what computers are for.</p><p>As bitched about before, American cellphones annoy me.  Though, despite being annoyed by my own phone on occasion, the auspicious Cingular 8525, it actually acts as a very nice Japanese phone, even though it's not cool looking and somewhat heavy.  It can do internet and email just fine, but the one thing i played with last night has sold me on it. (even though, i already bought and paid for it)</p><p>The 8525 actually has one of these infrared sensors on it, so i wondered if my American phone could talk with my Japanese phone.  An interesting experiment, indeed.  I turned on my Japanese phone and sent a contact over through infrared...  huzzah. My American phone captured the information and actually noticed it was a Contact..  It didn't decipher the 'title' of the contact correctly, but all the other information was intact.  I'm actually rather impressed..  I moved most of my Japanese contacts over to my phone in a matter of 20 minutes.  It took about a minute per contact.  Though, it doesn't allow me to enter detailed contact information about myself into the phone without listing myself as a Contact :/  oh well..</p><p>Now my next fun experiment shall be if the 8525 can read Japanese cellphone barcodes and make sense of them...<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Asahi stateside (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/asahi-stateside-2">Asahi stateside (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
