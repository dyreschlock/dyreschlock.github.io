| December 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the past couple of months my portable games device has been my PSP.  I've since I purchased my new slim PSP, I really haven't touched my DS except for a little Brain Age 2 Sudoku on trips.  Once Castlevania PSP came out, I've been hooked.</p><div class='title'><b>Rondo of Blood Remake</b></div><p>Rondo of Blood is a lot like Castlevania meets Super Mario Brothers.  There are secrets passageways, secret items, bonus all over each level in the game.  Rondo of Blood is very nostalgic-rich with several levels going through familiar territory as seen in Castlevania 2 and 3.  It is a Castlevania fans haven, which begs the question why it never came over in the first place?</p><p>Rondo of Blood was originally released on the PC-Engine (Turbo Graphix in the US).  Was it really such a risk to bring it over to the states even though Nintendo and Sega was beating the shit out of it?  What little ground they could have gained would have still given Americans one of the best Castlevanias ever made.  meh..  but whatever.</p><p>Rondo of Blood was also known as Dracula X and had a direct sequel, Dracula XX made or ported to the Super Nintendo.  Konami packaged the sequel as the original Dracula X when they released it here..  Dracula XX was a poor rendition of what made Dracula X so fantastic.  Where Dracula X was challenging, mysterious and interesting, Dracula XX made it difficult by throwing hordes of enemies at you, stripped away secrets, and spewed out a derivative version of the story.  But again.. whatever.</p><p>You play as Richter Belmont whose beloved Annette has been kidnapped by a servant of Dracula, Shaft.  Through each level you tear through the monsters through Dracula's castle to rescue her.  Along the way, you may uncover other maidens who've been kidnapped as well.  One such girl is Maria who has magical powers.  You can switch back and forth between Maria and Richter to topple Dracula.</p><p>Two of the biggest secrets in the game are unlocking the original PC-Engine version of Rondo of Blood, and a Playstation version of Symphony of the Night with Maria playable and faster loading times.  It's really not difficult to find these two at all..  despite the fact I had a little help from Gamefaqs.</p><p>Both are easy to find, but for Symphony, you might need a little direction on how to reach it.  Symphony of the Night can be found in Stage 3' (that's 3 with a tick mark behind it), and Rondo of Blood can be in Stage 4' (4 tick).  <b>As a rule of thumb</b>, if you're looking for any secrets in this game be sure to swipe at every part of every wall and throw axes at odd parts of the ceiling.</p><p>There's another third less-publicized unlockable game that's a bit more difficult to get to.  This one is Chi no Rondo no Blood, which was originally available when you put a PC-Engine cartridge in the console when trying to play Rondo of Blood, which was CD.  I just pulled that explanation out of my ass, so that might be how you unlocked it.  It reminds me of playing those Extra stages with Sonic & Knuckles when you put a non-Sonic game in the top slot.  To unlock Chi no Rondo, you have to play through the Boss Rush 3 times.. or something like that.</p><div class='title'><b>Symphony of the Night</b></div><p>Castlevania Symphony of the Night is one of the few games I wish I had played back in the day.  But I cared too much about squaresoft and rpgs at the time to care.  I was able to catch up with it when I started playing Aria of Sorrow on the Gameboy Advance back in 2003 or 2004.  I found a copy at Game Crazy and after experiencing Castlevania under Igarashi's reign..  I was hooked.</p><p>Symphony of the Night was when Igarashi took over the Castlevania series wasn't it?  Or was it Rondo of Blood?  I think Rondo of Blood may have been the first game to take the new subtitle naming scheme for each new Castlevania, even though it didn't back standard until they found their home on the portables.</p><p>When I first played through Symphony of the Night, I suddenly saw why people loved this game and why people regarded this as the greatest Castlevania.  Before that point, I didn't know that Castlevania turned into Metroid.  The music was fantastic and 2D graphics were beautiful...  It was great.  Flipping the castle upside down turned my world upside down too..</p><p>My next run-in with Symphony of the Night was in Japan about a year ago now when I found a pristine NEW copy of the Saturn version for $50.  Oh god, that version is a train-wreck.  Opening up the menu requires LOADING.  Whenever the track changes, there's 5 seconds of LOADING.  Everything fucking LOADS..  ugh.  Eventually I got stuck in the game, came back to the states, and never really touched my saturn again..</p><p>But these days are amazing with the unlockable copy on the PSP.  It sounds great through headphones, loading times are VERY fast, and you get a couple extras migrated from the Saturn version.  This is the definite copy of Symphony of the Night, so forget about Xbox Live or PSN..  Buy this reported copy of it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/draculax.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/draculax.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/draculax.webp" /></p><p><b>Perspective</b>Playing Rondo of Blood before unlocking Symphony of the Night, puts Symphony in a whole new perspective.  That scene portreyed at the beginning of Symphony..  when you are Richter fighting Dracula..  that is the end of Rondo of Blood.  After you exhaust every secret and facet of Rondo, the story continues beautifully with the next installment.</p><p>You have the two greatest and most significant Castlevanias in Castlevania history, back to back.  Once you are done with one amazing experience, you have the next.  Two classics, Two briliant video game masterpieces..</p><p>This is my definitive game on the PSP, despite being a remake and compilation, even though all the best PSP games are either remakes or compilations (or rhythm games).  Out of the 20-so PSP games on my shelf, this one stands tall against the others.  I would fully recommend this game to any fan of video games.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Juno" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/juno">Juno</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 23, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night my little brother and I caught a movie at one of our local theaters, the Eden Praire Mall.Â  It was a real heartwarming tale, but there were two things that really distracted me about the movie that kept me away from feeling the raw emotion so many women in the audience felt.</p><div class='title'><b>Synopsis</b></div><p>Juno is about a young girl (Ellen Page) named Juno.Â  She is sixteen years ago and has found out that she is pregnant after having sex for the first time with her boyfriend (Michael Cera).Â  She realizes that she can't possibly care for the child herself and she toys with the idea of abortion but can't go through with it.Â  So she turns to adoption and finds a couple Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and her husband (Jason Bateman).</p><p>By the partial cast listing, it's pretty easy to see why I wanted to see this movie.Â  I was very interested in seeing Michael Cera and Jason Bateman in serious roles outside of their type-cast roles they've been in since Arrested Development.Â  To their character, they still were Michael and George Michael, but they acted great in their moments of seriousness.Â  I hope they find more roles like this in the future, so I can see more of their acting ability. ^_^Â  I'll settle for their hilarious comedic character though..</p><p>Tangent: Both have movies coming out, by the way..Â  Michael Cera will return in Apatow's Year One sometime in 2009, while Michael Cera will support Will Smith in Hancock July 2008.</p><div class='title'><b>Distraction #1</b></div><p>Anyways, these two nagging distractions really only apply to me.Â  One thing that really pissed me off was this searing pain in my neck I had ever since I woke up in the morning.Â  I mean, it was like someone hammered a nail right into my spine in the base of my neck ..Â  The pain was almost paralyzing.Â  I'm actually quite reliefed that I can move today.Â  That and I was so monsterously sick the past two days.. ugh.Â  but Hurrah.. i'm in better health today!</p><p>Unfortunately, the nagging pain was the main emotion I felt which really drew away any overwhelming happiness the vast amount of the female audience felt due to their constant sniffling and "awwww honey, hold me" sentiment.</p><div class='title'><b>Distraction #2</b></div><p>The other thing that nagged me a bit was their location in the movie.Â  From the beginning, it looked like Juno lived in any normal rural town.Â  The first name drop was given by Michael Cera's character when he mention his friend or brother went to <i>Mankato</i> for college.Â  That was a big flag..Â  'Mankato?Â  As in Mankato State in Mankato, MN?'.. hmm..</p><p>My suspicions were confirmed with Juno gave the next name drop when she talked about some girl tearing off all her clothes and jumping into the fountain at <i>Ridgedale</i> mall.Â  Bingo..Â  I knew it.Â  West Suburbs of Minneapolis..Â  where I grew up.Â  The mission became to figure out exactly where Juno lived in the movie.</p><p>Well..Â  that's where the location kinda falls apart.Â  A couple times in the movie Juno drives out to see the adopting parents who live in a rich suburb entitled <i>Glacial Valley Estates</i>, which is later identified as residing in <i>St. Cloud</i>, an <i>hour and a half</i> away.Â  OK, so if Juno goes to ridgedale often and St. Cloud is an hour and a half away, then she probably lives in Plymout, Maple Grove or whatever cities are in between there.</p><p>What screws up this theory is Juno's Step-mom says "why the hell would go the East Jesus out there" when talking about St. Cloud.Â  Ridgedale is in Plymouth which is directly West of Minneapolis and Maple Grove is directly North of St. Cloud.Â  To go to St. Cloud from Ridgedale, you'd take 494 to Maple Grove and continue along I-94 to St. Cloud, which is directly North-West of Maple Grove.Â  There's nothing East Jesus about it.</p><p>For St. Cloud to be East anything of Juno's house it would take her around 3 hours to get to Ridgedale, and the scene where Juno just happens to run into Vanessa AT Ridgedale makes absolutely no sense.Â  Well....Â  nevermind, I guess it could make sense if it were a Satuday or Sunday.Â  I guess North-west-wise Ridgedale is the best mall option..Â  both Northern malls are crap.Â  well, Northdale is probably remodeled by now, but its difficult to get to and further away than Ridgedale.</p><p>Anyways, that was bothering me the whole movie.Â  I'm glad I went to go see this movie with my little brother because if I saw this with anyone in Madison or from school, they would have been constantly annoyed with me talking to myself trying to slooth their location.Â  In fact, the woman sitting next to my little brother kept telling me to shut up with her evil eye.</p><p>Later on, you get full view of their high school's name: "Dancing Elk High School", which I'm fairly certain doesn't exist.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't have Internet here so I can't really check up on anything.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Anyways, Juno is fantastic.Â  It's comedy-style has a very Napoleon Dynamite spin, but thank god the characters don't act that way.Â  It's extremely heartwarming, powerful, funny..Â  It's really great.Â  Definitely check it out.</p><p>Thankfully I got their nagging distractions out of the way the first time I saw it, so when I see it again and show it to people I'm not constantly talking during the film.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect Achievements" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-achievements">Mass Effect Achievements</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 18, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Mass Effect has a total of 45 achievements that can all be yours if you play through the game a minimum of 3 times, but even then you might screw yourself out of an achievement because you didn't do something you thought you were supposed to do.  Mass Effect has a lot of moments like that..</p><p>Because of the decisions I made, I need to play through Mass Effect a minimum of 4 times to gain all the achievements now...  I just completed it for the second time, so that leaves 2 more to go!</p><div class='title'><b>Counter Based Achievements</b></div><p>24 of these achievements I would class as counters..  Do this or collect this a certain amount of times and you get the achievement.</p><div class='title'><b>Kill things this many times (2 achievements)</b></div><p>A couple of these you'll easily get on your own.. like 250 synthetic kills, 150 organic kills..  I think i'd be more difficult if you completed the game killing less than 250 synthetics.</p><div class='title'><b>Use your weapon or heal 150 times (5 achievements)</b></div><p>There are 4 achievements for killing an enemy 150 with each type of gun.  These are pretty easy too.  Once you get one achievement, start using a different weapon.  There's an achievement for using 150 medi-gels..  Not too tough..  Just lead your cohorts into the line of fire and then heal them afterward.  As you continue through the game, you'll get it in no time.</p><div class='title'><b>Alignment (2 achievements)</b></div><p>These are 2 achievements for alignment.  If you reach 75% paragon, you get an achievement and the same with renegade.  Gamefaqs has a few glitches to earn infinite paragon and infinite renegade, but I couldn't get them to work.  It's pretty easy to tell which conversation options will get your paragon and renegade, but throughout the game there isn't enough to get both achievements in one play through.  You'll need to get one on the first playthrough, one on the second.  If you're achievement-whoring this game, this is no big deal.</p><div class='title'><b>Do something 75 times (11 achievements)</b></div><p>The real pain are those pesky "use this ability 75 times" achievements of which they are 11 for a mere 15 points each.  It's pretty easy to get in the habit of using your abilities, but those Tech abilities are not too useful in battle.  I really don't know what the point of these achievements are..  What do we really achieve by using these abilities 75 times?  If anybody has more than 6 or 7 of these achievements, you can tell they have a lot of time on their hands..  They take absolutely no skill to achieve..  Just time and consistency.</p><p>I have no idea if you get the achievement if instruct your party member to do the ability the 75 times, or if your character has to be the one to do it.Â  I will probably test this out in my third playthrough.</p><div class='title'><b>One million Dollars (1 achievement)</b></div><p>Lets see..  2, 6, 7, 9, 20.. one of the remaining 4 is getting 1,000,000 space credits.  This is not a challenge what-so-ever.  Just be an item-whore, which is standard for RPGs (getting all items everywhere), and selling off the ones you don't need.  You'll reach 1,000,000 way before the end of your first play through.  In fact, it didn't take too long in my second playthrough to hit the max of 99,999,999 credits and 999 omni-gels.</p><div class='title'><b>Level 50 & 60 (2 achievements)</b></div><p>Another 2 counter-based achievements are for experience.  You get an achievements when you reach level 50 and level 60.  You should be able to hit level 50 in your first playthrough if you do absolutely everything.  <b>Hint: You gain twice the amount of experience if you kill enemies outside of your lunar rover.</b>  Well, more accurately, killing things with the lunar rover will cut the gained experience more than half..  At the end of my first play through, I was 6,000 xp away from level 50.</p><p>Getting to level 60 is a royal pain.  You need 860,000 experience points to get level 60 and at the end of my second playthrough on New Game+, I ended around 750,000..  So i'll need to do another New Game+ with the same character i've been playing for 50 hours now to hit the 60th level.</p><p>You need to complete one playthrough before unlocking levels 51 through 60.</p><div class='title'><b>Scholar (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The final collection-based achievement is "Scholar", which is finding all the main Codec entries for the main alien races of the Mass Effect Universe.</p><p>You can get this achievement before you leave the citadel the first time, but you can screw yourself by not asking the right questions..  Before Eden Prime, ask Captain Anderson about the Protheans, and right after Eden Prime, ask Anderson about the Geth.  Those are the only two entries you can miss.  The other ones you can get by talking with Avina terminals, the Hanar in the Presidium Emporium, the Elcor in his embassy and the Volus dude in the Elcor embassy.  Once you're a spectre, talk to Anderson about the Batarians.  That should do it.</p><p>There's a full list in this faq: <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960" title="http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960">http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/930279/50960</a>.  Search for [SCH].</p><div class='title'><b>Progression Based Achievements</b></div><p>17 of Mass Effects' achievements I would consider progression based...  meaning, you get an achievement when you beat a level or progress through the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Beat the game (7 achievements), Do Stuff (2 achievements)</b></div><p>You cannot beat the game without getting 7 of these, but the other 3 are more sidequest related.  "Completing the game a second time" and "Landing on an Uncharted world" are self explanatory.</p><div class='title'><b>Fuck a party member (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The one side-quest achievement I missed on my first playthrough was the romantic subplot, which is pretty easy to get..  I was looking in the wrong place.  Just like real life.. :/</p><p>The romantic subplot involves you (the main charcter) and one of two party members.  If you're male, you can get it on with Ashley or Liara.  If you're female, you can sex up Kaidan or Liara.  Be sure to talk with the teammate you're hot for after each main mission, and you'll be in bed with them right before or after Ilos.</p><div class='title'><b>Complete the Majority of the game (7 achievement)</b></div><p>Completing 75% of the primary assignments and 75% of the secondary assignments will net you the main achievement, but there are 6 other achievements for each party member.  You must have them in your party at the time of completing that quest for it to count.  So be prepared for the Long haul.</p><p>Getting the achievement for Ashley and Kaidan is quite easy since you have them in your party from the start.  You get Garrus in your party pretty early too.  Wrex and Tali aren't too bad, but you'll need to put them in your party right away and never switch them out.</p><p>Liara is the most difficult to achieve.  You'll need to ignore all the sidequests in the citadel and go to Artemis Tau immediately after becoming a Spectre.  Once completed, head back to the citadel and complete all those sidequests are go from there.</p><p>I really had no idea how to get these achievements, so after two playthroughs, I only have 3 out of 6.  On my next playthrough, I'll probably go for Wrex and Liara since I've been playing with the same people for both games and I need a break.</p><div class='title'><b>Skill Based Achievements</b></div><p>There are 4 achievements that require actual skill.</p><div class='title'><b>Beat the game on this difficulty (2 achievements)</b></div><p>"Complete Mass Effect on Hard" and "Complete Mass Effect on <em>Insane</em>".  The gamefaqs guide says to get these achievements you must select your difficulty in the options before you start a new game.  However, I was able to get the Hardcore achievement by switching my game from Normal to Hard as soon as was able to after starting a New Game +.</p><div class='title'><b>Tactician (1 achievement)</b></div><p>I got this one without any trouble, so you probably don't need to worry about it.  I'm guessing the description is self explanatory:  The total amount of damage you sustain will be absorbed by your shields MORE than one your person.</p><div class='title'><b>Charismatic (1 achievement)</b></div><p>The description reads "resolve an impossible situation with charm or intimidation".  Basically, level up your charm or intimidation based on your alignment and there are 2 instances I know of where you must choose all the charm or all the intimidation conversation options.  These 2 times are: on Virmire when Wrex gets all pissed off about killing Krogan, and at the end of the game when you face Saren.</p><div class='title'><b>My own progression</b></div><p>Personally, I have 29 out of these 45 achievements.  I like playing Mass Effect quite a bit so I'll probably go through at least once more, but some of these achievements are really a waste of time.

| December 17, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This week is the last week for new TV.  Most shows have already finished, but "last to cross the finish line" new show <b>Journeyman</b> finally makes it in with Episode 11 tonight at 9pm central and Episode 12 on Wednesday at 9pm central.</p><div class='title'><b>Journeyman Finale</b></div><p>These final two episodes finally explain how Dan Vassar has been traveling through time answering that Lingering question.  Although with the end of the series, due to poor ratings, we are missing out on the bigger question of why Dan is traveling through time.  Series creator Kevin Falls has said that if the show had continued the season finale would have put all of Dan's time traveling into perspective.  Each leap through time is meant to align time in such a way to make an event happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, Journeyman was too slow and too disjointed to give this impression starting off.  If the audience would have realized Dan's time traveling was important, I think they would have much more viewers.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>January 2008</b></div><p>With Journeyman's finale 2007 ends, but despite the writer's continued strike, Late Night TV will return in January with or without their writers.  Specifically The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien.  Both shows will return and air new episodes beginning Wednesday January 2nd.</p><p>Both Leno and O'Brien have been huge supporters of the strike.  Their return is to start supporting their non-writing staff who have been laid off during these last two months of reruns.</p><p>David Letterman, on the other hand, is attacking the situation differently.  Letterman is attempting to strike an interim deal between Studio Execs and the WGA so when he returns on January 2nd, he'll have his writers.</p><p>Interesting developments..  The below linked article also suggests some alternative programming for Leno and Conan in lew of their monologue.  They might have more guests to fill in the time...</p><p>(source: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/arts/television/17cnd-leno.html?em&ex=1198040400&en=89cd181c775bb591&ei=5087%0A">New York times</a>)</p><div class='title'><b>February 2008</b></div><p>Besides Late Night returning, there are 2 amazing TV shows which return in the Spring that we haven't seen since their finales back in May..  Lost and Jericho.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4 - Thursday January 31st, 8pm Central</b></div><p>On Friday, the Lost Season 4 trailer flew across the Internet and made many people happy.  Here it is, in case you missed it: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbY_dWObLho</a></p><p>At first I was baffled..  "really?  It's still coming out despite the strike?  Last I heard, they only completed 8 of the 16 episodes before November 1st."  Later in the day, Aint it cool <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35076">reported</a> on the return of Lost stating that January 31st will be the beginning.</p><p>Upon further inspection, it looks they finished up Season 4 without the writers..  I mean, all the scripts were written before the strike began, but the writers are VERY involved with each episode as they make it.  They are always on hand to guide and shape each episode to fit their perfect vision.  They completed 8 episodes this way before the strike, so the final 8 episodes were done without the personal touch, which doesn't bode well.</p><p>Aint it Cool states that Showrunners Carlton Cruse and Damon Lindelof think the season finale is weak compared to previous Seasons.  That's rather pessimistic.</p><p>Lost Season 4 is 16 episodes which will air week after week without break.  I don't know if the season premiere and finale count as 2 each..  probably not.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho</b></div><p>Over the weekend, I caught my first glimpse of Jericho and my god..  this show is pretty damn awesome.  It's a lot like Lost except it hits real close to home..  I don't want to give away any of the story, though.</p><p>I went into Jericho episode 1 completely blind.  I had no idea what Jericho is, what is was about, or who was even in it.  All I knew is that the Internet saved this show and that people love it.  The first couple minutes of the show were pretty stereotypically, but when that climax music began to seep into the opening and you could absolutely tell that at any moment the plot of the entire show was going to hit...  I even said outloud.. "whatever is about to happen is going to make me love this show.. I just know it.."</p><p>then BAM...  I am an instant fan of this show.  It was totally engaging and made me want to watch every single episode after.</p><p>Jericho Season 1 has been out on DVD since October, so you can definitely netflix it..  OR you can watch every single episode of Jericho on the CBS website.  Yeah, it's crappy quality and Yeah, they have advertisements, but it'll give you a taste and, personally, a taste is all I needed.</p><p>Here's a quick link to all the episodes on cbs.com: <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261" title="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261">http://www.cbs.com/primetime/jericho/video.php?cat=1&video=1&page=1&inner=115261</a></p><p>If you really want to give yourself they perfect experience, Netflix the first DVD, put in it your player, turn up the sound, and turn off the lights.  You'll be on the edge of your seat.</p><div class='title'><b>Jericho Season 2 - Tuesday February 12th, 9pm Central</b></div><p>Anyways, thanks to the Internet, Jericho has been saved from cancellation and CBS has ordered 8 more episodes.  If all goes well with the ratings, CBS will order the rest of the season and probably more to come ^_^.</p><p>Much like Lost and other shows, these 8 episodes were surely completed before the strike, so they should be magnificent.</p><div class='title'><b>Other shows</b></div><p>For now, that's really all I can foresee coming to TV.  Some episodes of The Office, 30Rock and Earl were completely before the strike, so those couple episodes will probably air here and there in the spring..</p><p>In the meantime though...  enjoy winter!</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xbox 360 &quot;Fall&quot; Update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xbox-360-fall-update">Xbox 360 "Fall" Update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I like the new "fall" update to the 360.Â  It does 2 things that I really like:Â  faster window shades and daily updates.</p><p>Moving from window to window in the console overhead is around 2 times faster after the update.Â  You can actually accomplish things rather quickly, rather than having a second lag for the animation.Â  If someone sends me a message, I can run into the console and view it lickidity split.Â  I wonder if the second or two lag from before was because of some query process, or if it was the speed of the animation.</p><p>The daily updates are great too.Â  Now you can actually see what has been added to Xbox Live since you've been gone.Â  It flashes, too, to indicate something new has been added since the last time you connected.Â  There's so much stuff being added online that everyday it flashes with an update.Â  Far more frequent than the Wii.</p><p>You can also stream divx too, but I haven't messed around with that yet.Â  Good Stuff overall.Â  It makes managing the 360 stuff much faster and easier. ^_^</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End of Journeyman" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-of-journeyman">End of Journeyman</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been trying to get a hold of one of these things for months now.  It looks kinda big though... and crappy :/</p><p>I mean.. look inside of this thing:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0959.webp" /></p><p>There's nothing at all..  no padding, no soft inards, no nothing to keep it from scratching up my screen either.. what a rip.</p><p>It is rather big though.. let's compare it to the standard Sony PSP sleeve.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071203_katamari/100_0952.webp" /></p><p>Christ.. this case is big, it wasn't my eyes playing tricks ...

I've been trying to buy one of these cases off ebay ever since I first bought my PSP, but things had always gone wrong when trying to secure the highest bid.</p><p>The first couple times I just bid for it and then never checked up on it, thus lost the auction when someone swooped in at the end at sniped the auction from underneath me.  I didn't think the Katamari case was that sought after but FINE.  If that's the way you want to play it, then I guess we'll need to play the ebay sniping game.  I've sniped auctions before and its not that tough.</p><p>Well it is that tough when you aren't paying attention.  Each subsequent auction I put on my view list, I completely forgot about the time it ended.  Most of them ended on the weekend, so when I got to work Monday morning, there would be an email in my inbox, "An ending on your watch list is ending soon"..  Though, it would've already been ended at this point.</p><p>There were a few times I was this close to winning but I still got away from me.  One such instance happened a couple Mondays ago, when the auction ended at 7:30p and I totally remembered.  I wrote a reminder on my hand, remembered!, and perched myself in front of the computer on ebay hitting the F5 button.  I was pysched!</p><p>I kept hitting F5, 10 minutes remain..  F5, 7 minutes remaining..  "Oh, I could bid.. but there's always that slight chance someone will snipe my snipe.."  F5, 4 minutes remaining..  oh, so very close..  I'll wait until 1 minute and do it.  F5, 2 minutes remaining..  F5..  server cannot be found.  WHat?!?!  F5, F5, F5..  server cannot be found.  GODDAMN ROUTER!  Thankfully the episode of Heroes that night was one of the best I've seen, so I got over it pretty quick.</p><p>So I missed that one too..  But, eventually I preveiled and got my case. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Item Background</b></div><p>Originally this was the pre-order bonus for Me and My Katamari in Japan.  I don't think they ever brought this pre-order bonus to America when it was released in March 2006?  Was that when it came out?  We love Katamari was 2005, so it had to be 2006 sometime..  maybe May-ish 2006.</p><p>Anyways and Unfortunately, Me and My Katamari is absolutey horrible.  The game setup isn't too bad, you float around on islands and rebuilds islands in the ocean.  Pocket-sized goals for a pocket-sized katamari..</p><p>The gameplay is what kills this game.  Katamari requires 2 analog sticks, and the PSP has one.  I guess they thought using the D-pad and buttons would be a good substitute for analog sticks, but they are dead wrong.  I would love to play this game, if i could hook up a ps2 controller to my psp.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Anywho..  horrible game.  pretty crappy bonus.  Thankfully, it can hold the PSP and the PSP sleeve in the case, so it's not all bad.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Journeyman Update" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/journeyman-update">Journeyman Update</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Tonight at 9 (10 eastern) an episode of Life will air starting a two-parter to end in its usual timeslot of Wednesday.  Next Monday, Journeyman returns with its Christmas episodes and the next week will contain two episodes ending at half a season.  These two episodes promise to bring some answers as to what is actually going on with Dan's time leaping.</p><p>The internet's mobilization to Save Journeyman begins today!</p><p>What you can do to help save Journeyman is log on to nbc.com and watch episode 10 entitled "Blowback".  In fact, here's a quick link for you: <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml" title="http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml">http://www.nbc.com/Journeyman/video/episodes.shtml</a>.</p><p>This is the most recent episode of Journeyman and has really been the highlight of the show thus far.  In "Blowback", Dan learns more about the limitations of changing the past and how to fix mistakes when he alters the past beyond his "goal", whether or not his alterations were ethical.</p><p>The goal of this "demostration" is to show that people out there want to watch this show.  A spike in their online ratings should show we care right?</p><div class='title'><b>Quantum Leap</b></div><p>On a side note, one of my friends starting Netflixing Quantum Leap, so we've been watching an episode here and there.  That show is really a trip back in time in itself these days, seeing how it was made back in 1982.  Going back in time even further than that to fix the past makes it very interesting on several levels.</p><p>The shows humor and story are still quite solid to this day.  Definitely check it out, especially if you remember watching that show.  I used to watch that show over and over again when they aired re-runs on USA and the Scifi channel. ^_^</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (24)
