| August 15, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, one of the new ALTs, Garen, and I went to the Norikura Youth Center to do some reconnaissance for our upcoming English camp.  The center is located in the high foothills of the Norikura mountain, but it still quite a ways from the top.</p><p>There are quite a few hiking trails around the youth center.  Many of which lead to some small peaks of their own.  After doing a small bit of work, I thought it would be neat to see what the surrounding area had to offer.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0255_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0265.webp" /></a></p><p>The trails led through some deep forest.  The paths were nicely carved out of the forest, so walking and hiking was not difficult.  But any view of distant areas was obscured by the green, green trees.</p><p>Our route was a rather simple loop.  The first leg of the loop went to a peak covered in trees, so we couldn't see anything afar.  The route continued up and down several more peaks still covered in trees.  Up and down, up and down.</p><p>Eventually, the path gave way to some open air.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0304_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail met with a rocky path meant for vehicles.  One way led down, and back to some kind of civilization.  The other way the led up our next hill/mountain.  The road was a bit steep, though I'm sure most vehicles would have no problem climbing it.</p><p>We went up the road, and as the road began to level off, we turned around.  Towering above us, to the east, was Norikura.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0308.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0308_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0308_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0308_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0404_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0404_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0404_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0404_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0404_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0322_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0322_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0322_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0322_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0322_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking north gave a great view of the Youth Center.</p><p>Continuing just a little bit more west brought us to the end of the dirt trail, the top point of one of the Hida Takayama Ski slopes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0332.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0332_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0332_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0332_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0333_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0333_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0333_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0333_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0333_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0347_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0347_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0347_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0347_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0347_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was more inline with the kind of view I wanted to see along these trails.  I wanted a clear view of the cascading mountains, and possible be able to see some interesting things.</p><p>From this point, Takayama was visible.  From the above zoomed in photo, you can see many of the Takayama landmarks, like Associa, Valor, the religious temple, the Teva complex, city hall, and others if you stare at it long enough.  This view wasn't as wide-spread as other mountains I've hiked, but I was still satisfied. :)</p><p>We followed the road back down the mountain.  After the bend, the road twisted and turned to hug the contours of the ski hill.  At a point, we could easily see where we had been minutes before.</p><p>The end of the trail went with another rocky road.  One direction continued down and went to the Hida Takayama ski lodge.  We went the other direction, which went up back in the direction of the youth center.</p><p>Along the way, we saw more ski lift pillars dart the open hillside.  They led us to our next destination, another plateau with a nice view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0447.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0447_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0447_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0447_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0461.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0461.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0461_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0461_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0461_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The cascading forests obscured Takayama, but that created a much more pleasant view.  From green to aqua to blue.

Our hike basically went up and down the spines of each of them.  It was nice to end the hike by being able to see the contour of our travel, to look back.</p><p>We stayed for a little while and admired the view and the breeze.  The youth center was not that far away.</p><p>Before we returned to Takayama, we drove down to the lodge of the Hida Takayama Ski Slope.  Some people were camping out, but it was mostly empty.  Many ski slopes around the Hida region are pretty much this way during the summer.  There's obvious no business in the summer, so they're deserted.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0532_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0532_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0532_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0532_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150815_norikura/IMG_0532_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, it was a nice hike.  Scenic at the end, but not much going on in the forested trails.  Good exercise, too.  Lots of ups and downs.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Handheld Fireworks 飛騨高山手筒花火" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-handheld-fireworks">Takayama Handheld Fireworks 飛騨高山手筒花火</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It seemed weird that all these places had the same drawings or paintings in roughly the same places.  A few months after arriving, I found the following information posted in Hida-no-sato.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_0037_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So that's what they are!  These horse paintings are a good luck charm wishing for the safety and well-being of either business or family.</p><p>Then, it wasn't until last year, when I was hiking around <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">Harayama and the Matsukura area</a> that I learned where and how I could get one for myself.  These paintings were made during a festival held on August 9th and 10th in the Matsukura Kannon temple.  During this time, Ema painters and artists stay up for 2 days straight creating these paintings for whomever comes to the temple.</p><p>This festival is called <i>ema-ichi</i> <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span> or the Ema Painting Market.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9902_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is where I went.  I've been here twice before.  Once last year, hiking through Harayama for the first time (<a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">Sept 20th, 2014</a>).  And then again during winter (<a href="/old/v7/harayama-in-winter" title="/harayama-in-winter">March 1st, 2015</a>).  The winter was so harsh, that much of the paths through the woods were completely blocked with downed trees.</p><p>5 months prior, this is what the path looked like.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3869_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3885_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Now, downed trees were either moved out of the way, or cut through to create a traversable path.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9913_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much easier.</p><p>Along the path were several hanging signs advertising and announcing the festival.

Not many people were there.  Other than the folks actually putting on the festival, there were only a few attendees there to get paintings, so the line wasn't very long.</p><p>It took me a little while to figure out how to get a painting.  They had order forms on one end of the stage.  You write your name, address, and business, if applicable.  You choose the size, and color of the paintings you want.  And you need to provide a name to be written on the painting.  This name could be of your business, family, or yourself.</p><p>For me, I chose <span class='ja'>慈夢</span>, which can be read as <span class='ja'>ジム</span> or Jim, my name.  This is the kanji I have on my kendo <i>zekken</i> or name plate.  When I started kendo 2 years ago, one of the English teachers thought these kanji were applicable for me.  </p><p><span class='ja'>慈</span>'s <i>on</i> reading is <i>ji</i>, but singularly is <i>itsuku</i>.  It means mercy, or compassion.  <span class='ja'>夢</span>'s <i>on</i> reading is <i>mu</i>, but singular is <i>yume</i> or dream.  So, my kanji name means dream and compassion.  Everyone in Japan who reads my kanji name thinks it's cool and totally applicable.  I guess the compassion part fits, but I'm not really sure about dream.  Lots of Japanese names use that kanji, though, so maybe that's part of it.</p><p>Also, you need to choose which direction the horse should face: left or right.  Going back to that original definition, horse paintings should be directed inside the house.  The idea is that good luck with come into your lives, or into businesses.  But, I took the literal definition and had the horse facing outwards.  The idea being that my work is always done outside of house, and that's where I want my luck to be directed.  Additionally, I chose my kendo name so I would have good luck doing that.  And all of that is done outside of my house.</p><p>Anyway, you fill out the sheet, hand it to the guy, and pay him the cash.  Mine was 1500<span class='ja'>円</span>, I think.  Larger prints are more expensive.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9939_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then the painter writes in the date, his signature, and the name you give him.</p><p>I went with a simple painting on Japanese paper facing left.  I think I got the smallest, too.  The other prints were so large.  They wouldn't really fit anywhere in my place.  For colors, you could choose a brown, white, or black horse.  Or you could choose neither color, and go with my option.</p><p>Even though I chose the smallest option, it was still too large for most of the frames available.  Valor Home Center did have a large cheap frame that could hold my Ema painting, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150809_emaichi/IMG_9756_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Hurrah, I finally got my very own Hida horse painting.

Takane is one of Takayama's eastern-most neighborhoods. Back in the day, all of the pockets of modern day Takayama had thriving neighborhoods in the middle of nowhere. The people there worked in mines or with logging companies. </p><p>Because of their remoteness, these neighborhoods had their own elementary and junior high schools. During winter, there was so much snow that the roads became difficult and dangerous to drive. However, over time, people who grew up in these neighborhoods moved closer to Takayama proper for jobs. Mining and Logging jobs went away. Few young people remained. Also, with modern snow plows and busses (and also with climate change) traveling on those mountain roads were no longer that difficult.</p><p>Both Takane Junior High and Elementary closed, and any students living in Takane now had a bus to bring them to the next nearest school.</p><p>I visited Takane <a href="/old/v7/takane" title="/takane">last year</a> and peered around the old schools which were still there. Even though the schools closed, they were reused at community centers for cooking classes and other community classes. Now, one year later, the elementary school still stood, but the junior high has been completely demolished.</p><p>Below are the photos.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ikegaharashitsugen 池ヶ原湿原" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ikegaharashitsugen">Ikegaharashitsugen 池ヶ原湿原</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The major peaks of Hotaka are Okuhotaka <span class='ja'>奥穂高</span>, Karasawa <span class='ja'>涸沢</span>, Kitahotaka <span class='ja'>北穂高</span>, Maehotaka <span class='ja'>前穂高</span>, and Nishihotaka <span class='ja'>西穂高</span>.  <a href="/old/v7/norikura-snow" title="/norikura-snow">Mount Norikura</a> <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span> is not part of the range, by the way.  That is a separate mountain directly south from the Hotaka Range.  Though the Hotaka Range is mostly obscured from view in downtown Takayama, I do have a clear view of these mountains everyday from my junior high school in <a href="/old/v7/december-snow-2" title="/december-snow-2">Kiyomi</a>.</p><p>I rolled out of bed around 10:30am, climbed into my car, and drove the 70 minutes to the ropeway station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Shinhotaka Ropeway is a gondola ride that brings you to a station 2155 meters in the sky.

This is used to balance the weight from the other car carrying passengers.  The lower ropeway used to have two cars running on its ropeway, but on January 19th, they had an accident.  One of the cars (carrying 8 people at the time) was swaying back and forth and smashed into one of the support structures.  One woman was injured, but not seriously.</p><p>On January 31st, only the second ropeway had reopened, and not until last week, March 20th, had full service resumed operation.  The cause is not fully known yet, but I think they're simply blaming it on the heavy winds from that day.

There's the sweet, cold delicious taste of the ice cream.  And there's the hot, spicy, sometimes incapacitating flavor of wasabi.  I think some people avoid wasabi as much as possible because it's so potent.  I think that wasabi ice cream is a rare chance where the spiciness is so overpowered by the ice cream, you can actually taste wasabi for its distinct flavor, rather than its hot spicy texture.</p><p>Initially, you are hit by the sweetness of the ice cream.  For the first few seconds, it just tastes like normal ice cream.  But as the taste lingers in your mouth, and spice of wasabi starts to set and grow.  It's not hot, or overpowering.  It's just the flavor.</p><p>It's so good.  It's really the absolute softest safest approach to consuming wasabi.

We are completely surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the country, but there are plenty more low lying mountains standing above us.  Towards the end of summer, I became interested in hiking some the nearby mountains, and seeing our town from above, and had plenty success.  I wanted to hike during the winter to see the seasonal differences, and yesterday finally had great weather to do it.</p><p>I decided to hike Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span>, a mountain I had already hiked once before on <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">September 20th</a>.  It's probably the highest mountain nearest the center of Takayama, and it has a great view of the Shingu <span class='ja'>新宮</span> neighborhood, and some of the downtown Takayama, too.</p><p>Harayama was one of the easiest hikes I did over last summer, and you can drive quite near the peak.  In winter, things were much different.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unfortunately, with the heavy snow we received <a href="/old/v7/december-snow" title="/december-snow">last December</a>, many of the trees lining the mountain pass had collapsed, blocking the road.  It was completely blocked only 100 or 200 meters from Hida no Sato <span class='ja'>飛騨のさと</span>.</p><p>Several other cars had parked near the block, so I did the same.  I parked my car, and began my hike.</p><div class='title'><b>Walking to the Parking Area</b></div><p>I wasn't too worried since I had already hiked this area once before.  I knew the distance I needed to travel.  However, hiking in snow was WAY more difficult than I thought it would be, and there was a lot of damage from that December snowstorm that had not yet been cleaned up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I began by following the mountain road leading up to the parking area.  There was a path already laid out in the snow by previous hikers throughout the season.  A clear path of foot prints had packed down the snow, and created a frozen platform able to hold my weight.  Most of the time.  </p><p>Whenever I slightly veered off the course, I would sink in the unpacked snow.  Even sometimes the course itself wouldn't be able to hold my weight.  It would collapse, and I would sink in the snow.  Just like this:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow was still deep enough to sink past my knees.  My typical pace would be walking, walking, walking, sink, walking, walking, walking, sink.  It wasn't so bad at first.  I would usually leap out of the hole while I sank, and catch my balance.  But after doing this numerous times, the exercise began to wear on me.  And every time I sunk in the snow was a short little break.</p><p>I took plenty of breaks taking photos, too.  Also, I probably stopped every 2 or 3 minutes, to take in the beautiful snow covered scenery and snap several photos.</p><p>There were plenty of downed trees as well.  The first couple of trees were easy to duck under, but there were several just too big to hop over, and difficult to tell if I could actually go under.  It can became very clear that this hike was not a simple leisurely stroll.  Several of these trees, I had to actually crawl under in order to pass.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In addition to the road, there were hiking trails that went the exact same direction and several times passed the road.  I was getting sick of sinking in the snow every 10 or 20 feet, so I changed paths to the hiking trails at my next opportunity.  The trails had slightly less snow, and nearly all of its had been very well packed down.</p><p>But, this presented a new challenge.  The snow was packed so well, and so uniform that was nothing for my shoes to grip.  And the hiking trail was MUCH more vertical than the mountain road.  Now, I was constantly slipping at the most modest of inclines.  Towards the end of the trail as it crossed the road again, I was basically crawling my way up, and tearing through the outer edges of the ice into the snow.</p><p>Ugh, fuck that.  I'm going back to the snow.</p><p>I was one leg away from reaching the parking area, and the shelter came into view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Things got way worse.  At this point, way more hikers had used the trail, so the path of the road was much more narrow and weak.  Nearly every five steps, I sank into the snow, had to pull myself out, and then sink again.  I was taking a break almost every minute due to exhaustion.  As exhaustion continued, I became too lazy or tired to keep myself from fully falling into the snow.  The snow was nice and soft. :)</p><p>But I continued, and ripped through the snow.  Another hiker came into view, and heard me crunching through the snow.  He basically just stood there and stared at me like I was some kind of idiot as I continually sank in the snow, and running out of breath.  I said <span class='ja'>こんにちは</span> to which I received a belated response.  Then he talked with me for a little while.  We had actually met before.  He worked at City Hall, and we met at one of those social events they have.  I didn't remember him at all.</p><p>He asked what my destination was, and I replied <span class='ja'>たぶんここです</span> (maybe right here), but then later said I was planning on going to the summit.  He had just come from the summit, and said it would probably take about 30 minutes.  Yeah well, it had already taken me 40 minutes just to get here.  I guessed that with the current season, maybe 50 minutes was more accurate.  I mentioned I had hiked here before and knew the area, so while he may had tried to convince me to give up, he basically gave up, and wished me well.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing to the Temple</b></div><p>From the parking area, there are two paths to reach the summit: the high path, and the low path, the difficult path, and the easy path.  I took the low easy path.  During the summer, the high path was annoying.  I couldn't imagine how painful it would be now.</p><p>The low path leads directly to the Kannon Temple where they do the horse paintings near the end of summer.  From there, it was a straight descent to the summit.  The descent worried me, but covering over a kilometer on level terrain, then putting all the bullshit at the end seemed easier to tackle.</p><p>I put on my gloves, and continued forward.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were several ups and downs, and I sank in the snow fairly often, but it wasn't that bad.  It was no where near as exhausting as that last leg of the climb up.</p><p>Plenty of downed trees covered the path, so several times I had to get down on the ground at crawl through.  Many times I surprised myself with just how low I was able to go.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I mean, look at the trees in the above picture.

Several signs marked the path, and the distance continued to shrink.  800m, 550m, 300m.</p><p>Eventually, I reached the bend I remembered, lined with Matsukura-yama <span class='ja'>松倉山</span> flags.  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3892_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the foot of the entrance was a running stream of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3902.webp">water to drink from</a>.

The first leg of the trail was another 40 or 45 degree slope.  I sat on my feet, and zoomed straight down.  Whee!</p><p>What probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to traverse earlier via the road, took me less than 5 minutes to sled down via the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was pretty fun. :)  I continued sledding down the trails whenever I could.  After a while, the trails began to even out.  I was no longer able to sled, so I stuck with the roads, and keep on the icy path.</p><p>At last, I arrived back to my car almost an hour after I left the summit.  What took me 2 hours to climb, took me only an hour to descend.  Sure, I wasn't taking nearly as many pictures, and gravity was on my side, but that's still a huge gain in speed.</p><p>My gloves were completely soaked from the snow, and my inner clothes were completely soaked from sweat.  I brought some extra clothes with, so I changed into something dry before leaving the area.</p><p>Before heading to my appointment at 2pm, I drove through the Shingu neighborhood to take a reverse photo looking at the summit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's really not that much to look at from below, but from the top everything looks amazing.</p><p>The summit is that open area near the top.  The hill underneath also has a trail leading to the summit, but that was not the one I took.

| February 24, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lately, there have been so many beautiful sunsets in Takayama.  The clouds, fog, and snow stop mid-afternoon, and sky opens wide to allow the sun to say goodbye for the day.  The other night, I noticed some rather bright objects in the sky.  Usually, if you have to see a "star" that is WAY brighter than most, it's actually a planet.  And it definitely was.</p><p>I was witnessing an uncommon event where our view of both Venus and Mars were coming close to each other, and eventually Venus would overlap Mars, blocking it from view.  In addition, our view of the Moon also comes close to cross paths with the two planets and almost overlaps their view.  This was last Friday night.  I wish I would've been setup for it.</p><p>Tonight was the first clear night since then, so I went to the top of Kita-yama around 6:45pm, nearly 2 hours after sunset to take some photos.  Something else celestial was happening at that time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The International Space Station</b></div><p>At exactly 6:45pm, the ISS came into view in the Northwest sky.  It raced across the sky.  Then it set in the South.  Ever since <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon">the eclipse</a> last year, I signed up for NASA's Spot the Station service.  Here's the link: <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" title="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</a></p><p>Spot the Station was send you an email in the morning if the International Space Station happens to fly over head the coming night.  Just enter your email and location, and you're good for a year.  It's incredibly accurate.  It will tell you the exact date it will come into range, which direction in the night sky to look, and how long it will be visible.  Here's the email I got today:</p><p><code>Time: Tue Feb 24 6:45 PM, Visible: 5 min, Max Height: 55 degrees, Appears: WNW, Disappears: SSE</code></p><p>The station appears as a white dot in the sky and moves and a steady pace.  It makes no sound, and no visible trail.  You might think it was an airplane, but it's just a single light, and it's not blinking.  And then it disappears over some trees.  Gone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Moon</b></div><p>Luna is completely visible in the sky, too, illuminating nearly everything.

These two planets are just above the western horizon.
