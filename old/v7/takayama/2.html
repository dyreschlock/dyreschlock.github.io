It is one of the tallest mountains in the area at 1596 meters, and on a clear day, you'd be able to view both Toyama and Takayama cities from the top.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I had a friend coming to visit who was interested in doing a million things, and I had this mountain marked on my map from a while ago. So, we decided to take a look!</p><p>The pin on my map was for a parking lot pretty close to the peak, but after searching for hiking paths and current conditions, the Hida wilderness website marked the road closed due to a landslide. There's a hiking website (<a href="https://yamap.com/" title="https://yamap.com/">yamap.com</a>) where people record their hikes, and the most recent hikes of the mountain seemed to confirm it. </p><p>Using yamap as a guide, there were several places where we could start our hike, but ultimately we planned on starting at the campground where the road had been closed and going from there. Hikes on yamap confirmed this was possible.</p><div class='title'><b>The Climb</b></div><p>It took way longer to get to the campground than I had expected. We left a little later than planned, but the winding roads made us move very slowly.  Google Maps said it would only take an hour from my apartment. I think we left around 8:15am and finally made it to the campground at 10:05am. Even though we made two quick stops along the way, it took nearly 2 hours.</p><p>The campground was a nice piece of civilization carved out of the heavy thicket of trees and bushes. There was even a museum, or some kind of cultural hall, that detailed the surrounding nature. We didn't have time for it, though, and went straight on the path forward up the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4658_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The path itself was just the closed road, so it was pretty easy. We walked passed several dammed and relegated streams coming from above. Some of the cement structures lower in the streams had been eroded away.</p><p>The climb was steady and kept going and going. It wasn't long before we could see some of the height we had already traveled.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4667_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>45 minutes later, we hit the detour.  We had known that the road was closed due to a landslide, and the sign directed us to take this trail instead. It indicated that it led to the summit, and another hiker of their way down informed us that this was the way to go.  So we went.</p><p>Looking at Google Maps, it seems like the trail was about 600 meters.  Certainly not as long as the 3km we had already walked. However, our gradual 20 degree incline significantly spiked to 45 degrees, or more. The course had ropes to help pull ourselves up the climb, but it was still pretty rough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4688_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As in any marathon, you continue to push through and continue to move. The longer you stop, the longer it takes. But, my partner in climb doesn't do marathons, so we often took some breaks, which ended up being necessary. This trail completely exhausted my supply of water.</p><p>Another 45 minutes later, we reached the trail head and made it back to paved road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4699_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having gained some significant height, and as the paved road winded around the mountain to gain height, we often had a view that looked down on the path we've traveled. Just 10 minutes later, the top of the trail head looked so small and far away. Another 20 minutes later, even further. One of the best parts about this hike we being able to visually observe the distance we had traveled. We wouldn't have gotten this experience by simply driving to the top. On the other hand, we wouldn't have been dying of thirst and exhaustion either.</p><p>After 30 minutes, we reached the upper parking area at 12:15pm. There was no running water, but there were some jugs of water as to use as an emergency. It did not look safe, so we moved onward and upward. Often there were trails that appeared on the side the road that offered us a shorter path to the top. But, we had already experienced the cost of such shortcuts from the detour earlier, so we continued on the road.</p><p>45 minutes later, the emergency shelter came in view. We climbed up to it and took a break inside. Nearly to the top!</p><p>Outside of the shelter gave us our first grand view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4730_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think we stopped for about 10 minutes, and continued along the wooden path. Some of the path had degraded, and other parts were washed away from rain. The path looked like it went back down the other side of the mountain, which we didn't want to do. But, I scouted ahead and the path only dipped a little bit.</p><p>Around the corner, the path connected with the ridge line path. Going to the right, it lead to the peak.</p><div class='title'><b>Summit <span class='ja'>山頂</span></b></div><p>After nearly 3 hours of walking and hiking, and a total of around 8 or 9 kilometers, we had made it to the top. From the top, we had a 360-degree view of everything around us. The east (first panoramic photo below), the north (second), and the south and west (third).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4768_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4794_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4784_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The weather was pretty warm with only a few clouds when we started. But, there was a strong wind at the top. The wind had pulled in the clouds (and later on rain), so a lot of the view was covered. We could still see Toyama to the north, though not a lot of detail. To the south, we saw an area that had to be Takayama. We couldn't confirm it, but it couldn't have been anything else.</p><p>It wasn't really cold up there, but the wind was pretty strong. My hat blew clear off my head!</p><p>To the south-west was a Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span>, a small buddhist shrine. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4862_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I wonder how many buddhist monks hike the mountain to pray here.</p><p>The other notable location at the peak is a pond to the east. The trail maps said it would take about 25 minutes to get there (and another 25 minutes to get back), but looking at the time, we could not afford to go. We needed to get out of the mountains by sundown (5pm-ish), and we were getting close to that limit with the amount of time it would take to descend.</p><div class='title'><b>Descent</b></div><p>We left the summit before 2pm and took the paved road all the way down. At the top, the paved road began on a disheveled cracked helicopter pad. Moving down the road, some of it had been completely broken apart and ground into rock, but I think a car could still drive across it.</p><p>Turns out, going down the mountain is way more easy than going up. After about an hour, we made it back to the trail head for the detour. We decided to stay on the road this time, and go through construction. We knew how steep and hard the trail would be, and the construction and landslide couldn't be THAT bad.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4901_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Turns out, we were right. The construction and road repair was already complete. If the gate had been opened at the campsite, we could've driven this whole distance. The construction sign we found a little bit later indicated that the road would be open on October 20th, so maybe they still needed to test their repair, or something.</p><p>This road led off in the opposite direction before meeting back to where the detour began. Going down, it took us 45 minutes from where the trail head ended to where it began. This was the same time it took us to climb up.</p><p>Because it went off into another part of the mountain, I started noticing a lot of vines choking and strangling the trees and brush on the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4911_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was so thick. Nothing our size would be able to move through it. Everything was covered with this vine. My friend mentioned that it was probably all one organism, too, that just continued to grow and grow.</p><p>Eventually we made it through the thicket. We reached the start of the trail head and made it to camp, a bit further.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230930_shirakimine/IMG_4937_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going down the mountain is a bit easier, but the constant stamping of feet on pavement takes it toll on the soles of feet and the hip. But! We arrived and were finally able to refill our water. Another hour of driving through the windy roads, and we were back to civilization.</p><p>It had a been a while since I had been on a hike, and this one turned into one of the longest hikes I've done in Hida. Much like a marathon, you often question why you ever decided to do it not long after beginning. But you move past that feeling and start enjoying the moment, the movement, the nature, and accomplishment. I need to do some more hiking.</p><p>Overall, this was a great hike, even though a bit rough. This would be excellent to do again with absolutely clear weather.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><table><tr><td>9:27am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Sugadaira Campground <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平キャンプ場</span> </td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (construction)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>End of Trail</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:00pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Emergency Shelter <span class='ja'>避難小屋</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.417257, 137.111692">36°25'02.1"N 137°06'42.1"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Summit <span class='ja'>白木峰山頂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.415583, 137.112222">36°24'56.1"N 137°06'44.0"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Taishido <span class='ja'>太子堂</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.414110, 137.110897">36°24'50.8"N 137°06'39.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:25pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Shiraki-mine Parking <span class='ja'>白木峰駐車場</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418550, 137.104979">36°25'06.8"N 137°06'17.9"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>2:45pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (end) - skipped, took road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418701, 137.097612">36°25'07.3"N 137°05'51.4"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>3:30pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Detour (start)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.418338, 137.088122">36°25'06.0"N 137°05'17.2"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:15pm</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to car (Sugadaira Camp) <span class='ja'>杉ヶ平</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.428121, 137.083210">36°25'41.2"N 137°04'59.6"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>4:55pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Naratoge <span class='ja'>楢峠</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.347515, 137.067080">36°20'51.1"N 137°04'01.5"E</a></td></tr><tr><td>5:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Kawai <span class='ja'>河合</span> 471 Interchange</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.306396, 137.092159">36°18'23.0"N 137°05'31.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Matsukura 松倉 and Emaichi 絵馬市" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/matsukura-and-emaichi">Matsukura 松倉 and Emaichi 絵馬市</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

These mountains lead to excellent vantage points of the city, but all have their own history, too. The southwest mountains of Matsukura <span class='ja'>松倉</span> and Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span> used to be the center point of the ruling class of the town.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></b></div><p>Back in the 1500s, Hida was its own province amongst the warring states, and the rulers were the Anekouji Clan <span class='ja'>姉小路</span>. Takayama was the most prosperous area of Hida because it was the most open. Farmers could easily till the land and feed all of its people. There was plenty of roam to rear livestock, such as horses and cows. And, Hida was also known for its expert carpenters. The mountain of Matsukura overlooked the entirety of Takayama, so it was the perfect point to build a stronghold to defend the city. This was Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span>.</p><p>Towards the end of the 1500s, Oda Nobunaga <span class='ja'>織田信長</span> had begun his conquest of defeating all independent clan and armies and unifying Japan as a single country. In 1585, he dispatched Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span> to ascend the mountains of Hida and destroy the Anekouji Clan to claim the territory. The Anekouji Clan was easily outmatched, defeated, and killed.</p><p>With Hida and Takayama under the control of Nobunaga through Kanamori, peace came to the city, and Kanamori transformed the city into a vacation town for his rich friends. He built a new lavish castle, the Takayama Castle, closer to the center of town, and left Matsukura to rot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5938_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, Matsukura Castle is a complete ruin, and even those ruins fall further and further apart with each year. <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">9 years ago</a>, I traveled up to the top for the first time, and I did it again <a href="/old/v7/harayama-in-winter" title="/harayama-in-winter">a few months later</a> to compare the seasons.

The southern neighborhoods are obstructed by trees, and the eastern neighborhoods are behind the short mountains that cut through downtown.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Kannon <span class='ja'>松倉観音</span></b></div><p>Again, in 1585, the Kanamori clan, led by Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, took control of the Hida province and stationed themselves in Takayama.  After 108 years and 5 generations, Kanamori Yoritoki <span class='ja'>金森頼旹</span> was the current head of the clan. He was a troublesome child and leader, so the entire clan was removed from the Hida province in 1692 and transferred to modern day Yamagata.</p><p>At the same time, a buddhist monk named Tenden Koutou <span class='ja'>天電高幢</span> returned from his position at the Sennyu-ji Temple <span class='ja'>泉涌寺</span> in Kyoto, and built a shrine to Kannon in a cave of Matsukura mountain. This shrine is called a Fumonin <span class='ja'>普門院</span>, an official branch of temples across Japan that pray to the buddhist God, Kannon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Kannon is a deity in Buddhism that grants people deliverance from suffering. People will often pray to Kannon for protection from illness and prosperity for their family and livelihood. Kannon has six transformations, and the Matsukura Kannon Temple specifically prays to the Bato Kannon transformation.</p><p>Bato Kannon is the more violent and warlike transformation, characterized by a menacing horse head. Horses were a very important animal and symbol of old Hida. There were used for farming, transportation, and many people considered them members of their family. People from Hida and even further would travel with their horses to the temple on July 9th every year, to pray for the wellbeing and protection of their horses.</p><div class='title'><b>Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span> and Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span></b></div><p>Traveling up the mountain isn't so difficult today, but this was not the case 400 years ago. It caused a lot of stress for the horse. So, artists began painting horses on paper and selling them in downtown Takayama. These horse paintings were called Ema <span class='ja'>絵馬</span>, which literally translates to Horse Painting. Emaichi <span class='ja'>絵馬市</span> means Horse Painting Market.</p><p>At this market, farmers would buy whichever horse painting they thought looked most like their horse. Then, they would bring this painting up the mountain to the Matsukura temple instead of their actual horse.</p><p>Over time, this painted horse became a symbol for more than just their horse. Because a family would rely on their horse for their farm, the horse painting now encompassed a person's entire farm or business. Families also consider their horse a member of their family, so the horse painting protection began to expand to other members of the family, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Modern Day Emaichi</b></div><p>These days, the tradition continues. Almost every business throughout Hida (and most residences, too) will have a horse painting at the entrance. Pointed inward, the horse painting offers protection and prosperity for the business or family inside.</p><p>Every year on August 9th and 10th, the Bato Kannon deity is moved from the main Kannon temple in downtown Takayama into the Matsukura mountain. At this time, horse paintings are created for anyone that comes to visit and a Buddhist monk of the Kannon temple will infuse his prayer into the painting.</p><p><a href="/old/v7/ema-paintings" title="/ema-paintings">8 years ago</a>, I came here for the first time after finally learning about the origins of the horse paintings that I saw everywhere.

Retro museums focus on the era of economic revival of post-war Japan and all of the culture that came from it. Most items are from the 1950s and 1960s. But lately, some of these museums have added things from the 70s and 80s, sometimes even 90s.</p><p>I love retro museums because it's all history that our modern culture and society have been built upon. You could say that all history has built our modern lives, but recent history of 50 to 60 years is so close that you can easily make those connections to modern day and see how things have changed from not that long ago.</p><p>Showa Hall was one of the first touristy places I visited in Takayama when I first arrived 10 years ago, and I fell in love with the idea of retro museums. Last week, we had a field trip at school where we walked around town and viewed the town like a tourist, so I returned.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2475_t.webp"/></a></p><p>While Takayama has changed quite a bit in the 10 years I've lived here, the Showa Hall remains almost identical.

The Showa era ended in 1989 and ushered in the Heisei era.  But the 90s are Retro, so it still somewhat makes sense.  Maybe some of the J-pop records from the music store downstairs were already walking that fine line.</p><p>As mentioned above, I love Retro Showa-era Museums because the history is so close. But it's still history that I never actually lived, so even though it was near history, it was still distant.  The 90s are WAY different because not only had I lived through them before, they're only 30 years ago.</p><p>Also mentioned above, I revisited the Showa Hall during a school field trip, so they were many students in the museum at the same time, and I was with some teachers, too. One teacher is getting pretty close to 60-years-old, so he lived through the era with many of the items in the museum. He commented how he his school classroom looked identical to the one in the museum, and how he had memorized most of the music in the store from hearing it so many times.  His reaction was much more of a nostalgia trip than a "ugh I'm getting old" feeling.</p><p>Also, the 90s gaming stuff is really just tacked on. They aren't trying to recreate a 90s gaming room. They're just displaying a bunch of games and have the mini consoles up. Really low effort. You can get the exact same experience by going to any used game store. Maybe this better explains my apprehension of their 90s gaming display.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230517_showa/IMG_2112_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Showa Hall is still one of my favorite places in Takayama. Another Retro Museum had also opened in the last 10 years, but it's much more of a circus rather than a caringly curated collection and recreation of the times.

This takes all of the original hardware of the GameBoy Camera and puts it into a shell that you can attach actual Camera lens. You can read more about here: <a href="/old/v7/gameboy-camera-plus" title="/gameboy-camera-plus">/gameboy-camera-plus</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" /></p><p>Attached to the Pocket Camera Plus, I'm using a pretty generic and bare bones Zoom lens. I just bought whatever was cheapest on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">Amazon</a>. It has manually focus, zoom, and aperture, and has a focus length of 6mm up to 60mm. I guess that means it has a 10x zoom. Each of the rings has a pin used for movement, but these pins can be screwed in to keep the current setting.</p><p>In addition to the manual settings of the lens, the GameBoy Camera game has a Contrast and Brightness setting. Contrast is very important to reduce the harsh lights and darks coming into the camera. There is some automatic brightness control that the camera already does. This makes the manual aperture nearly useless. And even the digital brightness settings in the game can get overridden by the software trying to autocorrect the brightness.</p><p>For the following photos, I really only used the manual Zoom and Focus, and digital Contrast when taking photos.</p><p>Anyway, with my Pocket Camera and regular Camera, I went around town throughout the weekend and tested it out.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakurano Park <span class='ja'>桜野公園</span></b></div><p>It's Spring in Takayama, so the Cherry Blossoms are in full boom. One of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Takayama is northwest of the main town. On the way to Kokufu, Sakurano Park is off to the side of the highway on the other side of the river. It's the perfect place to have a picnic on a warm Spring afternoon while viewing the cherry blossoms. (Although, this Spring has been freezing with the occasional snow)</p><p>I took some photos in late evening as the sun was setting.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div

incredible amount of flexibility when taking photos. No matter how close or how far away from the subject, the zoom allows you to frame the photo and the focus allows you to get all of the detail. The sensor itself is still primitive by only allowing 4 colors, but you can still get a ton of clarity.</p><p>Of course, photos are best taken when the subject is clearly light. If there is no strong light source, then it can be hard to squeeze out detail. 4 colors can only do so much.</p><div class='title'><b>Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span></b></div><p>The next day, I went to Shiroyama Park downtown and took a few more photos.

The website <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/" title="https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/">https://www.timeanddate.com/eclipse/</a> has a list of all their occurrences past and present.</p><p>Living in Japan, I’ve already seen one total lunar eclipse in <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon">October 2014</a>.  It was a beautiful and clear night, so the red, blood moon cast in the Earth’s shadow was in clear clear view.</p><p>This January, there was another total eclipse, which began around 8:30pm.  The weather was cloudy, but it was light with many breaks.  The moon was clearly visible in the sky.  </p><p>It was also cold cold cold.  It was definitely below zero.  Maybe -4?  I thought about driving to somewhere beautiful and open to view the eclipse, but it was just too cold for me to sit outside.  The moon was clearly visible from my apartment, so I simply set up my tripod in my kitchen, opened the window, and shot the moon from there.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_4920_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the lack of indoor heating in Japan, the cold temperature indoors really made no difference.  My apartment usually feels like it’s colder inside than outside anyway.  It only lacks the wind.  Besides, sitting under a pile of blankets (as I usually do at home) would be warmer than sitting around outside.</p><p>Here was the schedule for the eclipse:</p><p>Penumbral begins - 7:50pm<br/>Partial begins - 8:50pm<br/>Full begins - 9:50pm<br/>Maximum - 10:30pm<br/>Full ends - 11:10pm<br/>Partial ends - 12:10pm<br/>Penumbral ends - 1:10pm</p><p>The penumbral is a partial shading or dimming of the moon as the Earth begins to eclipse the sun.  The partial is when the full shadow begins to engulf the moon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is the moon well into the penumbral and minutes before the partial began to creep.  I don’t really see much difference.  I guess maybe the moon dimmed a little bit more than normal, but it’s still in full view.</p><p>But as the partial began, the moon definitely started to show a noticeable difference.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5044_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The shadow started to form in the lower left and, steadily over the next hour, it would move the completely cover the moon.</p><p>Unfortunately, as the moon continued to rise higher in the sky, it was met with more and more clouds.  The moon still showed through the clouds, but became dimmer and more obscured.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5068_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was still able to stretch the focal length of my camera and extend the exposure to capture the moon, but with time passing, the details and of the moon blurred more and more.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5141_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As 9:50pm approached and the total eclipse should have been visible, the cloud cover became too great, and I lost any visual of the moon.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/180131_moon/IMG_5229_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It’s unfortunate, but I was glad to be able to see as much of the eclipse as I did.  I went outside a few times after to try and see it, but the clouds completely cover the sky.  I couldn’t even remotely tell where the moon would be behind the clouds.</p><p>Not everywhere in Japan was covered up, though.  Down in Gifu City, it was a completely clear night.

The forests that cover the roaming mountains strengthen, and show their brilliant deep green.  They fade into the horizon and turn from green to blue to match the sky.  Carved out of the valleys are small pockets of civilization where we live, surrounded by this awesome, beautiful nature.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5921_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>A strong part of the traditions of our area are onsen.  Onsen are facilities and hotels centered around a hot spring bath. A hot bath is the perfect cool down after exercise.  Intense physicality met with passive recovery.  The therapeutic effects of an onsen come from the temperature of the water, and its chemical make-up.  Though, I think the main reason people come to the onsen of Hida is the beautiful serene nature that surrounds you as you bath and relax.</p><p>You can receive the temperature benefits from any public bath in Japan.  Water temperature tends to be around 40ºC.  The hot water expands the muscles in your body and improves blood circulation.  The body works hard to cool itself, which increases your metabolism.  An onsen might also have a cold bath around 20º or below.  Lying in this pool is massively chilling and forces your muscles to tighten and contract.</p><p>The idea of contrast therapy is to hop back into a 40º bath, and alternate back and forth.  This soothes and heals muscle soreness, facilitates recovery, and conditions the body and skin against temperature change.  It feels fantastic, but be careful.  The rapid changes can cause dizziness and even fainting.</p><p>The Hida area has more than 250 onsen.  Many onsen in Hida have additional therapeutic effects from the unique chemicals in the water.  Many of these places are outside of cities, set in forests near some beautiful hiking trails.  These are some of my favorites.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2593_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Far east in Takayama is Hirayu no Mori <span class='ja'>ひらゆの森</span>.  This is a sulfur (<i>you</i>) <span class='ja'>硫黄</span> containing sodium bicarbonate saline hot spring (<i>tansan suiso shio izumi</i>) <span class='ja'>炭酸水素塩泉</span>.  It contains other minerals, too, such as calcium <span class='ja'>カルシウム</span>, sodium <span class='ja'>ナトリウム</span>, magnesium <span class='ja'>マグネシウム</span>, and chloride (<i>enka butsu</i>) <span class='ja'>塩化物</span>.  Sulfur, bicarbonate, and chloride hot springs are all known for their healing effect on cuts and bruises.  Sulfur springs also helps lower high blood pressure.  Bicarbonate springs are known to wash fat from the skin leaving it young and beautiful looking.  Chloride springs connect with proteins on the skin to strengthen it.</p><p>The indoor baths are gorgeous, and have the feeling of a Japanese castle.  Outside baths are carved out of the rock, and allow you to lavish in the surrounding nature.  It’s the most beautiful onsen I’ve been to yet.  And entrance is only 500<span class='ja'>円</span>!  It does get quite busy, though. </p><p>If you travel a little north, near the Fukuji <span class='ja'>福地</span> area is the Okuhida Green hotel, Yakedake <span class='ja'>焼岳</span>.  It’s a bicarbonate spring, and has a beautiful emerald green bath outside to match the towering forested mountains.  Entrance is 750<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2617_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2546_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Further south in eastern Osaka are a few onsen towns.  There’s Yuya <span class='ja'>湯屋</span> and Shitajima <span class='ja'>下島</span>.  In Shitajima, there’s Himeshaga no yu <span class='ja'>ひめしゃがの湯</span>, another bicarbonate spring facility that also contains sodium and chloride.  Outside, hot and cool baths allow you to bask in the sun.  Perfect for contrasting while listening to the flow of the nearby river and waterfall.  Entrance is 650<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p>Though, my personal favorite is Ebisu no yu <span class='ja'>恵比須之湯</span> in northeast Takayama.  This is primarily a carbon dioxide spring (<i>nisanktanso</i>) <span class='ja'>二酸化炭素</span>, which lowers blood pressure by expanding blood vessels.  It also has bicarbonate, sodium, and calcium.  I love this place because it’s small and out of the way.  There are no frills.  Just 3 baths set at 42º, 40º and 21º, perfect temperatures for moving back and forth.  After leaving the bath, my skin instantly dries, and feels so smooth.  I feel great every time I go there.  Entrance is only 550<span class='ja'>円</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2647.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2647.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2647_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2647_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160627_onsen/IMG_2647_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Check out any of these places if you’re in the area, and check out our Hida welcome guide for more recommendations for onsen in our beautiful home.</p><p>As a last recommendation, after any bath in Hida, the absolute best treat is a bottle of orange or pineapple Hida milk.</p><p><i>Originally written for the July 2016 issue of the Gifu Bulletin, a monthly publication sent to all ALTs in Gifu participating in the JET programme.

I had another mountain on my list of places to climb, and the day was still short since Funayama took a whole lot less time to climb than I thought it would.</p><p>I had lightly researched Mihakayama, so I knew where to start.  Mihakayama is the near the on-ramp for the highway.  Actually, part of the highway tunnels through the south end of the mountain.  The trail begins further up than that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9650_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail starts as an old service road for vehicles, but soon deteriorates from age and neglect.  At one point, the two tire tracks become a single trail no longer meant for vehicles.  And you become even more engulfed in the forest.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9674_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the climb continues, fallen trees cover the path.  The path itself is covered and hidden underneath the leaves of the other trees.  The trail is rather manageable, but there were some steep parts of the trail where I slipped because of the abundance of leaves.</p><p>The climb was separated into two parts.  The first part was the direct ascent from the parking space up the side of the mountain.  At the top of the spine, was a small camp site.  From there, the trail continued on the spine of the mountain until it reached the peak.  The trail alternated from facing west to facing east.</p><p>From the west, you could clearly see Kiyomi basking in the sun.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9707_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Facing east, the rest of Takayama started to become more and more clear.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9746_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9778_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161105_mihakayama/IMG_9781_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the most, this was really the best the view could offer.  The peak was defined with a small shrine, and a post indicating that you’ve reached the top.  But, the view was completely obscured by trees.  A nice observation deck could be built, but the area is a bit too far out of the way for anyone to care about making one.</p><p>This climb is more about the journey, rather than the destination.
