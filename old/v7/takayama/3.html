From Ina City <span class='ja'>伊那市</span>, I went west to Kiso Town <span class='ja'>木曽町</span>.  From there continued west to Takayama.  After climbing the continuous inclines, I turned a corner, and saw Mt. Ontake <span class='ja'>御嶽山</span> towering over me.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_ontake/IMG_6383_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_ontake/IMG_6383_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_ontake/IMG_6383_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_ontake/IMG_6383_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_ontake/IMG_6383_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ontake-yama is the second highest mountain in Japan, and late September last year, it unexpectedly erupted killing several hikers, injuring many more, and showering Kiso town with an annoying layer of ash.

| March 28, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, it was way too nice outside to not go outside and take some photos.  I was super hungover from drinking with teachers and parents the previous night, but it was too perfect a day to waste sleeping.  A perfect day such as this requires a trip to the Shinhotaka Ropeway.  On such a nice day, you can see everything the view has to offer.</p><p>Shinhotaka <span class='ja'>新穂高</span> refers to the base area in Takayama underneath a collection of mountains known as Mount Hotaka <span class='ja'>穂高岳</span>.  These mountains rest in northeastern Takayama bordering Nagano prefecture, and are some of the tallest mountains not only in Gifu, but all of Japan.  The major peaks of Hotaka are Okuhotaka <span class='ja'>奥穂高</span>, Karasawa <span class='ja'>涸沢</span>, Kitahotaka <span class='ja'>北穂高</span>, Maehotaka <span class='ja'>前穂高</span>, and Nishihotaka <span class='ja'>西穂高</span>.  <a href="/old/v7/norikura-snow" title="/norikura-snow">Mount Norikura</a> <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span> is not part of the range, by the way.  That is a separate mountain directly south from the Hotaka Range.  Though the Hotaka Range is mostly obscured from view in downtown Takayama, I do have a clear view of these mountains everyday from my junior high school in <a href="/old/v7/december-snow-2" title="/december-snow-2">Kiyomi</a>.</p><p>I rolled out of bed around 10:30am, climbed into my car, and drove the 70 minutes to the ropeway station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5358_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Shinhotaka Ropeway is a gondola ride that brings you to a station 2155 meters in the sky.  It rests on a plateau on the side of Mount Nishihotakadake <span class='ja'>西穂高岳</span>, which has an altitude of 2909 meters.  </p><div class='title'><b>Shinhotaka Ropeway - Lower Station</b></div><p>There are two stations at the bottom of the mountain, and another gondola ride between them.  I parked at the lower station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5375_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The above photo shows a counterweight passing by.  This is used to balance the weight from the other car carrying passengers.  The lower ropeway used to have two cars running on its ropeway, but on January 19th, they had an accident.  One of the cars (carrying 8 people at the time) was swaying back and forth and smashed into one of the support structures.  One woman was injured, but not seriously.</p><p>On January 31st, only the second ropeway had reopened, and not until last week, March 20th, had full service resumed operation.  The cause is not fully known yet, but I think they're simply blaming it on the heavy winds from that day.  Here's an article about it: <a href="http://www.chunichi.co.jp/s/article/2015031690200848.html" title="http://www.chunichi.co.jp/s/article/2015031690200848.html">click!</a>.</p><p>Inside the station, I bought my ticket, and waited for my ride.  Entry is 2900<span class='ja'>円</span> ($29), which is not really that cheap.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5380_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On our way to the main ropeway station, the cabin attendant mentioned the accident over the intercom.  This made some people gasp, and look around nervously.  Of course, it was not windy in the slightest this day.  Only a breeze.</p><div class='title'><b>Shinhotaka Ropeway - Second Station</b></div><p>From the second station, the gondola cars are much bigger, much bulkier, and much safer, too.  We continued to ascend, and the summit came closer and closer.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We arrived.  Everyone raced out of the car, and climbed the stairs to the top of the station.</p><div class='title'><b>Ropeway Summit</b></div><p>From the top, the sky was the most blue I had every seen before in my life.

If you ever have the chance to come to the Shinhotaka Ropeway, you ABSOLUTELY must try the wasabi ice cream, which is rather unique to the ropeway.  I haven't seen this flavor available anywhere else.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5788_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are two very strong flavors that are completely opposite.  There's the sweet, cold delicious taste of the ice cream.  And there's the hot, spicy, sometimes incapacitating flavor of wasabi.  I think some people avoid wasabi as much as possible because it's so potent.  I think that wasabi ice cream is a rare chance where the spiciness is so overpowered by the ice cream, you can actually taste wasabi for its distinct flavor, rather than its hot spicy texture.</p><p>Initially, you are hit by the sweetness of the ice cream.  For the first few seconds, it just tastes like normal ice cream.  But as the taste lingers in your mouth, and spice of wasabi starts to set and grow.  It's not hot, or overpowering.  It's just the flavor.</p><p>It's so good.  It's really the absolute softest safest approach to consuming wasabi.  All wasabi and almost none of the spice.</p><div class='title'><b>Foot Bath</b></div><p>One of my favorite places is on the way back to central Takayama.  Just west of Tochio <span class='ja'>栃尾</span>, is <span class='ja'>火山の恵</span> <span class='ja'>広場</span>, which apparently translates as the Volcano Wisdom Plaza.  Here you can pay 100<span class='ja'>円</span> ($1), and soak your tired feet for the recommended 30 minutes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150327_hotaka/IMG_5821_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hot, scalding, therapeutic waters burn away dead skin cells and excite the muscles.  After, your skin is left clean of death, and very smooth.  Several times, I exited the bath, and walked in the snow to flash fry and freeze my feet.  It didn't completely work.  Also, the bath really wasn't all that hot on this day.  Maybe I'm getting used to scalding water on my feet, though.</p><p>Sitting down, and burning away your feet would be a nice relaxing end to a day of hiking.  But for me, it was simply the end of a day riding a gondola.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hina Matsuri ひな祭り in Hida no Sato 飛騨の里" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hina-matsuri-in-hida-no-sato">Hina Matsuri ひな祭り in Hida no Sato 飛騨の里</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

That's not really the case in Hida.  Not only is there still snow on the ground, but it still continues to snow!  It just snowed today, too.  As such we have our own regional "girl's" festival celebrating Hina Matsuri and the arrival of Spring called Ikibina Matsuri.

We are completely surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the country, but there are plenty more low lying mountains standing above us.  Towards the end of summer, I became interested in hiking some the nearby mountains, and seeing our town from above, and had plenty success.  I wanted to hike during the winter to see the seasonal differences, and yesterday finally had great weather to do it.</p><p>I decided to hike Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span>, a mountain I had already hiked once before on <a href="/old/v7/matsukura-castle-harayama" title="/matsukura-castle-harayama">September 20th</a>.  It's probably the highest mountain nearest the center of Takayama, and it has a great view of the Shingu <span class='ja'>新宮</span> neighborhood, and some of the downtown Takayama, too.</p><p>Harayama was one of the easiest hikes I did over last summer, and you can drive quite near the peak.  In winter, things were much different.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3783_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unfortunately, with the heavy snow we received <a href="/old/v7/december-snow" title="/december-snow">last December</a>, many of the trees lining the mountain pass had collapsed, blocking the road.  It was completely blocked only 100 or 200 meters from Hida no Sato <span class='ja'>飛騨のさと</span>.</p><p>Several other cars had parked near the block, so I did the same.

However, hiking in snow was WAY more difficult than I thought it would be, and there was a lot of damage from that December snowstorm that had not yet been cleaned up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3801_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3814_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I began by following the mountain road leading up to the parking area.  There was a path already laid out in the snow by previous hikers throughout the season.  A clear path of foot prints had packed down the snow, and created a frozen platform able to hold my weight.  Most of the time.  </p><p>Whenever I slightly veered off the course, I would sink in the unpacked snow.  Even sometimes the course itself wouldn't be able to hold my weight.  It would collapse, and I would sink in the snow.  Just like this:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3828_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The snow was still deep enough to sink past my knees.  My typical pace would be walking, walking, walking, sink, walking, walking, walking, sink.  It wasn't so bad at first.  I would usually leap out of the hole while I sank, and catch my balance.  But after doing this numerous times, the exercise began to wear on me.  And every time I sunk in the snow was a short little break.</p><p>I took plenty of breaks taking photos, too.  Also, I probably stopped every 2 or 3 minutes, to take in the beautiful snow covered scenery and snap several photos.</p><p>There were plenty of downed trees as well.  The first couple of trees were easy to duck under, but there were several just too big to hop over, and difficult to tell if I could actually go under.  It can became very clear that this hike was not a simple leisurely stroll.  Several of these trees, I had to actually crawl under in order to pass.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3826_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In addition to the road, there were hiking trails that went the exact same direction and several times passed the road.  I was getting sick of sinking in the snow every 10 or 20 feet, so I changed paths to the hiking trails at my next opportunity.  The trails had slightly less snow, and nearly all of its had been very well packed down.</p><p>But, this presented a new challenge.  The snow was packed so well, and so uniform that was nothing for my shoes to grip.  And the hiking trail was MUCH more vertical than the mountain road.  Now, I was constantly slipping at the most modest of inclines.  Towards the end of the trail as it crossed the road again, I was basically crawling my way up, and tearing through the outer edges of the ice into the snow.</p><p>Ugh, fuck that.  I'm going back to the snow.</p><p>I was one leg away from reaching the parking area, and the shelter came into view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3840_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Things got way worse.  At this point, way more hikers had used the trail, so the path of the road was much more narrow and weak.  Nearly every five steps, I sank into the snow, had to pull myself out, and then sink again.  I was taking a break almost every minute due to exhaustion.  As exhaustion continued, I became too lazy or tired to keep myself from fully falling into the snow.  The snow was nice and soft. :)</p><p>But I continued, and ripped through the snow.  Another hiker came into view, and heard me crunching through the snow.  He basically just stood there and stared at me like I was some kind of idiot as I continually sank in the snow, and running out of breath.  I said <span class='ja'>こんにちは</span> to which I received a belated response.  Then he talked with me for a little while.  We had actually met before.  He worked at City Hall, and we met at one of those social events they have.  I didn't remember him at all.</p><p>He asked what my destination was, and I replied <span class='ja'>たぶんここです</span> (maybe right here), but then later said I was planning on going to the summit.  He had just come from the summit, and said it would probably take about 30 minutes.  Yeah well, it had already taken me 40 minutes just to get here.  I guessed that with the current season, maybe 50 minutes was more accurate.  I mentioned I had hiked here before and knew the area, so while he may had tried to convince me to give up, he basically gave up, and wished me well.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing to the Temple</b></div><p>From the parking area, there are two paths to reach the summit: the high path, and the low path, the difficult path, and the easy path.  I took the low easy path.  During the summer, the high path was annoying.  I couldn't imagine how painful it would be now.</p><p>The low path leads directly to the Kannon Temple where they do the horse paintings near the end of summer.  From there, it was a straight descent to the summit.  The descent worried me, but covering over a kilometer on level terrain, then putting all the bullshit at the end seemed easier to tackle.</p><p>I put on my gloves, and continued forward.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3850_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were several ups and downs, and I sank in the snow fairly often, but it wasn't that bad.  It was no where near as exhausting as that last leg of the climb up.</p><p>Plenty of downed trees covered the path, so several times I had to get down on the ground at crawl through.  Many times I surprised myself with just how low I was able to go.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3860_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_3881_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I mean, look at the trees in the above picture.

This time when I sank in the snow, my single leg would sink down near my waist.  And it would usually scratch against broken branches, or rock.  Sinking was really no longer just a funny oopsie-daisy.  It could actually damage my leg if I were moving fast into it, or if I wasn't paying attention.</p><p>This became any actual climb now.  I was using my arms to stabilize my weight, and pull myself up some areas.

I climbed that mountain last year, too: <a href="/old/v7/ibuseyama" title="/ibuseyama">September 3rd</a>.  It would be amazing to climb that mountain now, but it would be way too difficult.  It's also very remote, so it's much more dangerous for me to go alone.  There is a home up there, though, so maybe it's plowed.</p><div class='title'><b>Heading back to the car</b></div><p>Anyway, I took my photos, enjoyed the view, but had to begin my descent.  I needed to be somewhere at 2pm, and it had already taken me 2 hours to reach my current position.</p><p>Going back down was WAY easier than the climb up.  For the super slick icy parts, I could bend down and use my shoes to sled across the path.  I was so close to the ground, that falling didn't matter, and I could easily control my descent breaking with my arms in the snow.</p><p>I glided past Anvil Rock.  Going through the valley of snow wasn't as slick, but getting out of a sink hole was way easier going backwards.

The first leg of the trail was another 40 or 45 degree slope.  I sat on my feet, and zoomed straight down.  Whee!</p><p>What probably took me 15 or 20 minutes to traverse earlier via the road, took me less than 5 minutes to sled down via the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4177_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was pretty fun. :)  I continued sledding down the trails whenever I could.  After a while, the trails began to even out.  I was no longer able to sled, so I stuck with the roads, and keep on the icy path.</p><p>At last, I arrived back to my car almost an hour after I left the summit.  What took me 2 hours to climb, took me only an hour to descend.  Sure, I wasn't taking nearly as many pictures, and gravity was on my side, but that's still a huge gain in speed.</p><p>My gloves were completely soaked from the snow, and my inner clothes were completely soaked from sweat.  I brought some extra clothes with, so I changed into something dry before leaving the area.</p><p>Before heading to my appointment at 2pm, I drove through the Shingu neighborhood to take a reverse photo looking at the summit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150228_harayama/IMG_4195_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's really not that much to look at from below, but from the top everything looks amazing.</p><p>The summit is that open area near the top.  The hill underneath also has a trail leading to the summit, but that was not the one I took.  In hindsight, it may have been faster, and definitely a shorter distance, but there's no temple, or anvil rock on that path.</p><div class='title'><b>Winter <span class='ja'>冬</span> and Summer <span class='ja'>夏</span></b></div><p>Of course, the reason I choose my path was to specifically compare the environments I had experienced in the summer to now.  I probably should've prepared more for this, but I got a few photos pretty close.

The clouds, fog, and snow stop mid-afternoon, and sky opens wide to allow the sun to say goodbye for the day.  The other night, I noticed some rather bright objects in the sky.  Usually, if you have to see a "star" that is WAY brighter than most, it's actually a planet.  And it definitely was.</p><p>I was witnessing an uncommon event where our view of both Venus and Mars were coming close to each other, and eventually Venus would overlap Mars, blocking it from view.  In addition, our view of the Moon also comes close to cross paths with the two planets and almost overlaps their view.  This was last Friday night.  I wish I would've been setup for it.</p><p>Tonight was the first clear night since then, so I went to the top of Kita-yama around 6:45pm, nearly 2 hours after sunset to take some photos.  Something else celestial was happening at that time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3726_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The International Space Station</b></div><p>At exactly 6:45pm, the ISS came into view in the Northwest sky.  It raced across the sky.  Then it set in the South.  Ever since <a href="/old/v7/october-moon" title="/october-moon">the eclipse</a> last year, I signed up for NASA's Spot the Station service.  Here's the link: <a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" title="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/">http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/</a></p><p>Spot the Station was send you an email in the morning if the International Space Station happens to fly over head the coming night.  Just enter your email and location, and you're good for a year.  It's incredibly accurate.  It will tell you the exact date it will come into range, which direction in the night sky to look, and how long it will be visible.  Here's the email I got today:</p><p><code>Time: Tue Feb 24 6:45 PM, Visible: 5 min, Max Height: 55 degrees, Appears: WNW, Disappears: SSE</code></p><p>The station appears as a white dot in the sky and moves and a steady pace.  It makes no sound, and no visible trail.  You might think it was an airplane, but it's just a single light, and it's not blinking.  And then it disappears over some trees.  Gone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150224_planets/IMG_3727_t.webp"></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Moon</b></div><p>Luna is completely visible in the sky, too, illuminating nearly everything.

But, this morning, the snow was done, and the sky was beginning to clear.</p><p>According to the news, by 3pm yesterday, the mountains in Niigata had received the most snowfall at 200 centimeters.  Mountainous areas of Nagano, Fukushima, Gunma, and Fukui had received between 150 and 180 centimeters at the most.  (Easy conversion:  100 cm = 1 m =~ 1 yard = 3 feet).</p><p>Locally, the Hida area and Gujo city received plenty of snow, too.  Hida Kawai received 136 centimeters since 3pm yesterday.  Shirotori in Gujo got 131, and Shirakawa-go had gotten 125.  In Takayama, we got about 120cm, maybe.  Meanwhile, Gifu City (in the south) got only 6 centimeters.  Unfortunately, within the Hida region and Gujo city limits, about 7770 households are without power, which means they have no heat.  Some of the more outlying schools are still closed this morning, too.</p><p>After waking up this morning, I peaked outside, and the clouds around Norikura began to clear.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9451_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141219_snow/IMG_9467_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On my way to work, the sun climbed over the mountains, and brightly lit Norikura (above).</p><p>I'm in Kiyomi today.

According to the Internet, we've received about 85 cm since this time yesterday.  And by this time yesterday, teachers were convinced that amount had already fallen.  It certainly doesn't seem like we've accumulated nearly 5 feet of snow, but I guess it's possible.</p><p>Takayama City actually canceled school today, which is almost unheard of.  For most teachers in Takayama, they can't remember a time of school ever being canceled due to snow.  (Though, they seem to cancel school pretty often for typhoons.)  Yesterday, school was let out early, too.</p><p>But!  While school is canceled, that doesn't mean it's a day off for the teachers.  We still must come to school because it's our job.  This morning I cleared more than a foot of snow off of my car, and had to shovel a path in front of my car in order to make it onto the road.  One of my neighbors had his car stuck and blocking traffic, too, so I helped push his car out of the ditch.  But I made it to school on time.  No problem.</p><p>At school, all of us teachers went outside, shoveled snow, and knocked snow off of the trees.  There was definitely more than 3 feet of snow piled up on the school grounds, so maybe we have accumulated 5 feet overall.  After that, we dispersed throughout the neighborhood to check for any "dangers".</p><p>Today, I'm at Minami Elementary School, which is located near the center of town near the train station.  Because this school is so centrally located, there are no buses.  All students walk to school, so when we check for "dangers", we're basically verifying that the routes students take to get to school are safe for the students to travel.  I guess I'm not sure what we were actually looking for.  Sinkholes?  Or downed power lines?  The routes I (and another teacher) checked were clear of those dangers.  Though, the snow was piled up so much that anyone walking was basically forced into the streets.  I figured that was pretty dangerous.</p><p>But whatever... Students weren't coming to school today anyhow.  As I walked around, I took several photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9373_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9394_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9421_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9434_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9436_t.webp"/></a></p><p>We basically just cover the north-western blocks from the school to the supermarket to the river and back.  Plenty of residents were outside shoveling snow, and clearing their cars and driveways.  We didn't see any kids, though, which was weird.  You'd think they'd be running around playing in the snow.  Though, I suppose the streets were pretty dangerous with oncoming traffic.</p><div class='title'><b>Shoveling Snow in Takayama</b></div><p>There is one big difference between shoveling snow in the Midwest and in Japan.  In the Midwest, you typically shovel snow from your driveway into your yard.  However, in Japan, there are no yards.  At least, not in the city area.  Thankfully, I live near a river.  So, when it snows enough to be shoveled, my whole neighborhood just shovels all the snow into the river.</p><p>During our neighborhood safety check, plenty of citizens were doing the same.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9398_t.webp"/></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141218_snow/IMG_9409_t.webp"/></a></p><p>If you live near a river, you basically fill up one of those sleds with snow, drag it to the river, and chuck in it.  And repeat until complete.  Sometimes, residents will fill up a pickup truck with snow, and then drive to the river and dump it.</p><p>Another method for the more landlocked neighborhoods of Takayama is using the gutters on the sides of the roads.  There is enough water running in Takayama, that it never freezes.  Some neighborhoods open up the gutters running on the sides of the streets, and shove the snow inside.  The running water melts the snow, and carries it away.  These neighborhoods are usually tightly packed, so they don't really have a lot of snow to shovel anyway.  It's usually just the strip of sidewalk in front of their house.</p><p>One other method by the lazy residents of town is shoveling the snow into the street.  In a typical winter Takayama day, it snows throughout the night, and warms up a bit during the day.  The warmth during the day usually melts whatever snow collected on the roads overnight.  So by pushing the snow in the streets, cars will run over it, and the daily warmth will melt and get rid of it.  It's still lazy, though.</p><p>Anyway...  maybe the snow was stop tonight some time, and we'll actually have class tomorrow.  Or maybe not.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/from-nagoya-to-takayama-in-winter">From Nagoya 名古屋 to Takayama 高山 in Winter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, I drove down to Nagoya to listen to some music.  Nagoya is almost directly south from Takayama.  When taking the Express Way, it's pretty much direct.  Just go south, and you're nearly there.  It's about a 2 1/2 hour drive, so I compare it to a drive from Madison, WI to Chicago.</p><p>However, there is one huge difference between those two drives:  <b>elevation</b>.  Takayama sits in an open plateau on the west end of the Japanese alps surrounded by some of the tallest mountains in Japan.  Nagoya is a port city near the Pacific Ocean.  So while the temperature drops, and the snow begins to fall in Takayama, it's still Autumn down in Nagoya.</p><p>And the drive between Takayama and Nagoya highlights these seasonal changes in a mere 2 hour span.  I took photos on the way down, and on the way back.  Here's my trip on the way back:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9291_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In Nagoya, it was partly cloudy.  This was at 11:00am.  The sky wasn't a pure blue, but there were breaks that let the sun shine through.  As I got out of the main urban sprawl of Nagoya into Ichinomiya, I was traveling directly north, and pointed towards a storm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141214_driving/IMG_9294_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Those road signs above mention that at Seki <span class='ja'>関</span> and Minokamo <span class='ja'>美濃加茂</span>, there are safety checks to ensure drivers are properly applying and using chains on their tires.

I was still south enough where the ground was warm.</p><p>As I continued, the houses began showing snow collecting on the roofs.  I reached Minokamo, and all traffic was diverted into the rest area.  Traffic officials were present to check cars for winter tires and chains, and help anyone putting chains on their tires.

Plus, my kei-car naturally drags, so I can slow down fast enough if I need to.</p><p>Once past Shokawa, though, the snow starts to let up a little bit, and the accumulation on the road isn't as great.

The roads are mostly clear of snow, too.  I arrived home around 1:00pm.</p><p>It's pretty crazy to think that a mere 2 hours away down south, it was probably still sunny, and completely free of any precipitation.  If this were a drive from Madison to Chicago, the weather would be almost identical.  Living in the mountains is amazing.  We're in our own little winter wonder world up here away from the rest of civilization. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Snowcapped Norikura" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/norikura-snow">The Snowcapped Norikura</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I say, "technically," because it was really more like rain that froze into ice and hail before it hit the ground and then immediately melted.  I was outside playing tag with the 2nd graders at the time, too.  It was certainly not snow.  After lunch, the hail started picking up a little bit, but nothing stayed solid on the ground for more than a second or two.  Other more remote, and colder regions of Takayama experienced actual snow.  But, in similar fashion, it almost immediately melted as it reached the ground.  </p><p>Though, for the more highborn mountainous unpopulated areas of Takayama, this was another day of November snow to begin the winter season.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_4234_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When driving home on Sunday, I took a right turn and standing before me was a scene that looked like a painting in some guy's hunting lodge.  The white capped peaks of Mt. Norikura.  For the past few weeks, there hasn't been a lot of sun.  It has rained several times in Takayama.

(0 Celsius)  It didn't really feel all that cold outside, either.</p><p>Throughout the day, the temperature did not rise as I figured it would.  Slowly and surely the cold began to set in, and things were no longer as comfortable as I figured they would be.  Inside the building, the air system turned on, and began pumping heat through the vents.  We looked outside for a quick peak, and it was very lightly snowing. :)  This was the actual first snow I saw for this season.</p><p>The next day, when driving back to town from Kiyomi, it had indeed snowed much more than what I saw up there.  This was the first day that Norikura showed it's snowcapped peaks for this season.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_2827_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_2827_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_2827_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_2827_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141116_norikura/IMG_2827_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama Fall Matsuri 秋の高山祭" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-fall-matsuri">Takayama Fall Matsuri 秋の高山祭</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The Spring festival celebrates the Sanno Shrine <span class='ja'>山王神社</span>, and takes places on the southern end of downtown Takayama.  I wrote about that one here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.  The Fall festival is on October 9th and 10th, and centers on the Hachiman Shrine <span class='ja'>八幡神社</span>.  This is the more northern area of downtown Takayama, and is much closer to my house. :)</p><p>Thousands of tourists, both domestic and foreign, come to Takayama to view the beautiful and hand-crafted festival floats, or yatai <span class='ja'>屋台</span>.  The floats are pulled out of storage, and displayed for the town to see.  Every year, there are marionette performances <span class='ja'>からくり奉納</span>, and a procession of the shrine <span class='ja'>御巡幸</span>.  At night, the floats are lined with lanterns, and paraded through town.  </p><p>This year, the crowds were really sparse.  Perhaps only one thousand people actually attended.  The newspaper blamed the eruption of Ontake-yama, and the recent typhoons.</p><p>Both festival days were weekdays, so I could only attend the night parade, as usual.  This was better than last year, though, which had the night parade canceled due to rain.</p><div class='title'><b>Night Parade <span class='ja'>夜祭</span></b></div><p>I arrived after the parade started, but that's fine.  It began at 6pm, and continued until 8:30pm or 9pm.  It mostly circled through the streets downtown, so it was very easy to go down side streets and catch up with the start of the parade.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9133_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last few floats were still waiting at the starting point when I reached Hachiman shrine.  Circling around to the start was easy.  I tried to watch the Shi-shi performance, but the crowd was too large to get a good view.  One of my 4<span class='ja'>年生</span> students found me.  She's a tiny girl less than a meter tall.  She could not see either.  </p><p>She had me follow her to the next point ahead of the parade, and we waited while see showed me her pictures.  There were almost no people there either, so we had a front view of everything.  The Shi-shi arrived and waved to the crowd.  All of the teenage and child Shi-shi dancers were students of mine (past and present).  One yelled out, "Hey Jimu!"  The whole crowd was silent as I replied, "Hello!"</p><p>They continued walking on, and the floats followed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9160_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141009_matsuri/IMG_9164_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are 11 floats in the Takayama Fall Festival.
