| June 3, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I teach at 4 different schools, and the main schools that I teach at are in the village of <b>Kiyomi</b>, which is part of Takayama city.  Today, Kiyomi has 1 junior high school, and 1 elementary, but it used to have a whole lot more.</p><p>Last year, Kiyomi Junior High School celebrated its 50th year.  And this year, Kiyomi Elementary celebrates its 40th.  When both schools were opened, it was the consolidation of all the education in Kiyomi into a single building.</p><p>Back when I first started at Kiyomi, I spent a few days in the Library, and looked through books in their "local" section.  I found a book published by the City Council of Kiyomi that was basically the almanac of the village.  It details Kiyomi's agriculture, industry, demographics, and history.  There was a section of the book titled <span class='ja'>わたしの学校</span> (or "My School") which I found quite fascinated.  It had a timeline of all the schools that ever existed in Kiyomi village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, I present to you: The History of Kiyomi Schools.</p><p><i>Much of the general historical information was taken from Wikipedia.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Meiji Period</b></div><p>The earliest schools in Kiyomi date all the way back near the beginning of the Meiji period.  <span class='ja'>明治</span>6, 7, and 8 marked the beginning of Kiyomi's 6 major schools.  That's 1873, 1874, and 1875.</p><p>The Meiji period marked the beginning of Japan's restoration to bring themselves out of their feudal society and into the modern world that was way more advanced than they were.  Education was one of the biggest concerns in the country.  In 1871, the Ministry of Education was established with a school system closely based on the United States.  They created elementary, middle, normal, and university school systems.</p><p>Elementary schools taught primary education are were meant to create loyal subjects to the Emperor of Japan.  Middle schools were secondary education, and were basically the equivalent of a High School.  They were to prepare students to enter Universities, and the Universities were to create students into leaders and modernize Japan.  Normal schools were training schools for graduates of middle schools who wanted to become teachers. </p><p>By 1900, Enrollment in public schools was 90%, whereas the start of the Meiji era only had 50%.<br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>At this time, the 6 schools in Kiyomi were:</p><p><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>まきがほら</span> / Makigahora<br/><span class='ja'>福奇尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>ふくより</span> / Fukuyori<br/><span class='ja'>巣野俣尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>すのまた</span> / Sunomata<br/><span class='ja'>夏厩尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>なつうまや</span> / Natsuumaya<br/><span class='ja'>池本尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>いけもと</span> / Ikemoto<br/><span class='ja'>大原尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>おっぱら</span> / Oppara</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>Kiyomi had 2 branch schools, too:</p><p><span class='ja'>森茂分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>もりも</span> / Morimo<br/><span class='ja'>楢谷分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>ならだに</span> / Naradani</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Each school (and branch school) is named after the neighborhood it resides it.</p><p>The official declaration of a school was <span class='ja'>尋常小学校</span>.  <span class='ja'>尋常</span> or <span class='ja'>じんじょう</span> translates as public, or common.  <span class='ja'>小学校</span> (<span class='ja'>しょうがっこ</span>) is elementary school.  Branch schools were <span class='ja'>分教場</span> (<span class='ja'>ぶんきょうじょう</span>).</p><p>Higher education became increasingly important as Japan continued to industrialize.  In 1904, in Kiyomi, Makigahora, Fukuyori, and Natsuumaya all changed their designation to <span class='ja'>尋常高等小学校</span> adding the <span class='ja'>高等</span> into their names.  <span class='ja'>高等</span>, or <span class='ja'>こうとう</span>, stands for "high class."  It's also the same word used for Senior High School <span class='ja'>高等学校</span>.</p><p>In 1907, elementary school attendance was made mandatory.  From now on, all children in Japan were required to have 6 years of primary education.  Middle schools were only required for students who wanted to go to a university, or normal school.</p><div class='title'><b>Taisho Period</b></div><p>In 1912, Emperor Meiji passed away, and Taisho became the new emperor.  The educational system became even more centralized, but there were plenty of good things that happened.  The Extraordinary Council on Education was created in 1917 and set forth many reforms.  Many more private colleges were now officially recognized.  Subsidies were introduced for poor families so their children could attend schools.</p><p>Education started to become much more militaristic, too.  And Japan started using a lot of educational ideas from Germany to instill the ideas of nationalism, patriotism, and militarization.</p><div class='title'><b>Showa Period</b></div><p>Nationalism and Militarization continued as Japan entered World War II.  In 1941, the educational system renamed all of its schools to <span class='ja'>国民学校</span> (<span class='ja'>こくみんがっこ</span>), which means National People's Schools.  This is taken from the German language.  Nation People's School translates as Volksschule, which is interesting, too.  Schule is School in German.  Volks stands for "people of", "national", etc.  The name Volkswagen makes a lot of sense now.</p><p>The elementary schools now required mandatory military training.  The principles of education now taught traditional, political, religious, and moral values.  Every day was to serve the Empire of Japan.  Every school in Japan turned into a cult of worship building loyal soldiers to die for their country.</p><div class='title'><b>Post-War</b></div><p>In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, and the educational system of Japan had collapsed.  As the United States occupied Japan and rebuilt it, there were several specific missions sent to rebuild the educational system.</p><p>One of these new reforms was to recreate the division between the levels of schooling to resemble the US.</p><p>Before now, elementary education was 6 years, secondary education was 3 years, and higher education (university) was 4 years.  Only elementary schools were mandatory.  The reforms now created two tiers of secondary education: lower and upper, and made lower secondary education mandatory for all students.</p><p>This created the following:</p><p><span class='ja'>小学校</span> - Elementary Schools - Elementary education for 6 years.  (required)<br/><span class='ja'>中学校</span> - Junior High Schools - Lower Secondary education for 3 years. (required)<br/><span class='ja'>高等学校</span> - Senior High Schools - Upper Secondary education for 3 years.<br/><span class='ja'>大学校</span> - University - Higher education for 4 years</p><p>The year <span class='ja'>昭和</span>22, or 1947, was the first year to follow the new law.  This is the system that Japan follows today.  Even though Senior High Schools are not required, 94% of junior high school graduates apply and enter high school.  And more than 95% of students graduate.  (As of 2005)</p><p><div class="title">Kiyomi Village</div><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>In 1947, the 6 major schools turned into the following:</p><p><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞中小学校</span> / Makigahora JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>福奇中小学校</span> / Fukuyori JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>巣野俣中小学校</span> / Sunomata JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>夏厩中小学校</span> / Natsuumaya JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>池本中小学校</span> / Ikemoto JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>大原中小学校</span> / Oppara JHS+ES</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>And there were now 4 branch schools</p><p> <span class='ja'>池本中小森茂分校</span> / Ikemoto JHS+ES (Morimo Branch)<br/><span class='ja'>上小島分校</span> / Kami Odori Branch School<br/><span class='ja'>小島山分校</span> / Odori Mountain Branch School<br/><span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span> / Naradani Branch School</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Even though, the grades were separated, the Junior High and elementary schools still operated in the same building.</p><p>I found a book in my local library that listed the attendance for each of these schools starting in <span class='ja'>昭和</span>30, or 1955.  Combining the attendance at each school, there were 373 junior high school students, and 750 elementary students in that year.</p><p>The population of Kiyomi was decreasing, and the world was getting smaller with advancements in automobiles, and other forms of travel.</p><p>With the junior high school system in place, all schools across Japan began making separate buildings for junior high students only.  In 1962, construction began for a single building in all of Kiyomi that would unite the junior high students under one roof.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> / Kiyomi Junior High School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" /></p><p>In <span class='ja'>昭和</span>38, or 1963, Kiyomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> opened for its first school year, and all the junior high school students in Kiyomi village now attended this school.  Both Morimo Branch School <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>, and Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> still served some junior high students, but only in the winter when traveling to Kiyomi JHS was too difficult.  For Junior High, both schools operat as branch schools of Kiyomi JHS, whereas for elementary, they operated as branch schools of the nearby elementaries.</p><p>Also, Kiyomi JHS had an attached dormitory.  During the winter months, and throughout the year, students would be able to live at the school rather than make the journey home.</p><p>In its first year, the graduating class of Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> was 126 students, which were split between 3 classes at school.  The Junior High had an attached dormitory, so students from the distant areas of Kiyomi lived at school for the whole week before returning home for the weekend.</p><p>I think it became a real point of pride for Kiyomi when the junior high school opened.  For the first time in its history, all the village's students attended the same school, and had classes together.  It really brought everyone together, and became a symbol for the community of Kiyomi.</p><div class='title'><b>Consolidation</b></div><p>A few years after Kiyomi JHS opened, the lingering branch schools began closing and filtering their students into the junior high school, and existing official nearby elementary schools.  Though, this was also more likely because the more remote regions of Kiyomi were no longer self-sustaining, and people were moving into the more populated areas.</p><p>The Sunomata ES <span class='ja'>巣野俣小</span> building closed in 1965, and all their students now went to Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span>.  And with the closure of Sunomata, the Naradani Branch School <span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span> closed, too.  Any students in Naradani probably just went to Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span>.</p><p>The Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> changed it's name to Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>冬期分校</span> in 1965.  <span class='ja'>冬期</span> or <span class='ja'>とうき</span> is Japanese for Winter Term, so I'm guessing this school was only used in the winter to relieve the students of the dangerous daily journey to school.  It stayed open for another 3 years, and closed for good in 1968.</p><p>Also, in 1968, the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span> of Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span> closed.</p><p>Kiyomi now had 5 operating elementary schools, and one distant branch school (Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>).  Until…</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> / Kiyomi Elementary School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" /></p><p>In 1974, or <span class='ja'>昭和</span>49, as the population of Kiyomi continued to decrease by the younger generation moving away to more prosperous areas of Takayama, construction of Kiyomi Elementary School <span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> was complete.  Makigahora ES <span class='ja'>牧ケ洞小</span>, Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span> both closed and their students now attended Kiyomi ES.  Natsuumaya ES <span class='ja'>夏厩小</span> closed as well, and those students filtered into Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>.</p><p>The two most distant schools, Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span> and Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>, continued to operate after Kiyomi ES was open.</p><p>The Morimo Branch <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span> finally closed, too, on the eve of Kiyomi ES's opening.  I think the final remaining residents of that neighborhood finally moved closer in Kiyomi, or another neighboring area.  Which left Morimo completely uninhabited.</p><p>10 years later, in 1984, Ikemoto ES closed its doors, and its students went to Kiyomi ES.  And then, finally, in 2003, Opara ES closed, too.  </p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>And that brings us to today.  Since then, Kiyomi village has only two schools, Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> and Kiyomi ES <span class='ja'>清見小</span>.  Both of which all students in Kiyomi attend.</p><p>It's really hard to believe that Kiyomi JHS could actually hold 126 students in each class.  Today, each class has 23 to 27 students.  The population decline in Japan is very real, and it's very apparent when you start viewing the historical records in the schools.  Each year, graduating classes get a little bit smaller, and a little bit smaller.  Then those schools are closed, and students are filtered into the larger nearby schools.</p><p>At Kiyomi elementary, there are photos of the 10 schools mentioned above in the main entrance of the school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From top to bottom, left to right, we have:</p><p>Ikemoto <span class='ja'>池本</span>, Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, Odori Mountain <span class='ja'>小鳥山</span>, Natsuumaya <span class='ja'>夏厩</span>, Kami Odori <span class='ja'>上小鳥</span><br/>Makigahora <span class='ja'>牧ケ洞</span>, Fukuyori <span class='ja'>福寄</span>, Sunomata <span class='ja'>巣野俣</span>, Oppara <span class='ja'>大原</span>, Naradani <span class='ja'>楢谷</span></p><p>Even though the schools were closed, some the building were reused and repurposed by the government.

| June 1, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I made my second attempt to reach Kiyomi Morimo <span class='ja'>清見森茂</span> by myself.  It's not too difficult to locate using Google Maps.  If you search for the neighborhood, Maps will give you a delightful outline: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d" title="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d">here</a>.  Looking on the map, there's only two ways to get to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>: come from the east, or come from the south.  My first attempt was coming from the east in which I ran into possible trouble.  Today's attempt was coming from the South, and going through the village of Shokawa <span class='ja'>荘川</span>.</p><p>If you follow the highway's frontage road south from the Hida Kiyomi entrance, about 15 minutes later, you'll come across a small farming neighborhood that has a road leading into the wilderness.  This road continues to follow a stream as it approaches Miboro Lake <span class='ja'>御母衣湖</span>,  Actually, right as that streams connects with the lake, you've arrived in the very southern tip of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.</p><p>Today, I drove to this neighborhood, and took the road into the forest.  After 10 minutes of driving, the pavement ends and turns into a rocky "dirt" road.  Still traversable, but at a much slower rate.  </p><p>As I continued through the forest, I actually came across some kind of neighborhood.  A house on stilts stood near this turn-off.  Looking at the map (36.081985, 137.002227), the road trails off but rejoined the main road not that much further, so it seemed like a "great" idea.  So, I decided to drive through this neighborhood.</p><p>The roads were actually paved, but were also totally covered by dried leafs, pine needles, some fallen branches, some fallen rocks, and some fallen trees.  Several times, I exited my car to clear the road for my car.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" /></p><p>I found 4 houses packed within this neighborhood.  Each house was on stilts, built in the middle of the forest.  There were no cars around, so I couldn't tell if anyone actually lived in them.  I would guess not.  At least not anyone of our society.  Bums or squatters could have been inside, but there's no way they could live without assistance from the outside world.  There were no gardens, or any livelihood at all.  Just an old house.</p><p>I did not pry.</p><p>However, Google Maps lied, and the roads that were certain to bring me back to the main road did not exist.  I turned my car around, and went back the way I came.</p><p>With that done, I continued on my way to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, and met my first obstruction: a big red gate.  The gates were at this point: 36.101633, 137.001209.  From the main road, these gates were about 23 minutes in.  Some other cars were already parked there, and an ashed fire pit was next to the white van.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" /></p><p>Past the gate was something I was very curious about.  On Google Maps, at point: 36.114263, 136.997079, the road is cut off as it hits a connecting stream.  On the other side of the stream, Maps marks a "walking only" road, which continues onward to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.  There's gotta be a bridge there, I thought.  Or some easy way to get across.</p><p>However, if the bridge was out, and I could walk across, Google Maps says it's about a 12 kilometer walk to where I considered a downtown area of Morimo.  Maps says that's a 2 hr 42 min hike, one way.  From my current position, I'm walking anyway.  But now there's an addition 2 kilometers to this possible bridge, which will add another 20-25 minutes.</p><p>Even though I needed to walk, I was still curious about the bridge, and walking that distance doesn't bother me.  So, I parked my car, grabbed my camera, ID, and water bottle, moved around the gate, and continued to walk down the road.  After 27 minutes, I reached that point on the map (36.114263, 136.997079), and HOLY SHIT!  The bridge actually exists!  Ha ha ha, I knew it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" /></p><p>But now I had a decision to make.  It's about 3:40pm.  I figured I could cover the 12k in about 2 hours at most, since it's a little more than half a half marathon length (23.1km).  That would get me back to my car around 8pm, I think, which is past sunset, and an absolutely bad idea.</p><p>I dunno… I couldn't simply stop, though.  So, I stupidly decided to continue.  I'll give myself until 5pm, then turn around.  Well, I didn't even last until 4pm when I came across an immovable barrier at point (36.119619, 136.988925), and immediately turned around.</p><p>As I turned the corner at that point, there was <b>a brown bear</b> in the middle of the road.</p><p>When I saw it, I thought it was a giant hyena, or some kind of wild dog.  It was big, though.  I'd say it was as big as I am.  It was facing directly at me, and it clearly and immediately saw me the instant I saw it.  My footsteps were making enough noise that it probably heard me coming.  I immediately recognized this situation as DANGER.  Without even thinking, I did a 180, and walked back the direction I came.  This all happened within a second.  The creature came into view, my brain said NOPE, and I am now walking back to my car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" /></p><p>I walked with the same attitude I had before seeing it to make it think I wasn't afraid or something.  And I was surveying the ground for anything I could use as a possible weapon if thing started stalking after me.  Also, I was still trying to figure out what I had just seen, and the likelihood of whether or not it would come after me, and if I were actually capable of defending myself.  Which was doubtful.  If that thing started chasing and attacking me, I'd be beaten down pretty quickly.  </p><p>And then I started thinking of that girl who was attacked by a bear.  And while the bear was eating her alive, she called her mom crying and panically explained the situation as it happened.  This one: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html">Daily Mail… sorry :(</a></p><p>After a few minutes of walking, and looking over my shoulder every couple of seconds, I figured it was far enough away, and that I could start running now.  I checked the time as well, so I could pinpoint this location later.  It was 3:56pm.</p><p>I made it back to Google's invisible bridge at 4:07pm.  Still no <b>bear</b> behind me.  And I made it back to my car at 4:28pm.  Still no bear.  Safe!</p><p>Again, I thought it was some kind of dog or hyena or something.  It had a long face, and body more like a dog or hyena.  Not a bear.  Or at least, the "bear" body image that always comes to mind.  Bears always seem so puffy.</p><p>Once at home, I started searching on Google to figure out what I had seen.  Apparently, Japanese wolves are extinct, and any wild dogs are no longer than 100cm (or 1 yard).  I searched for other wildlife in central Japan, and didn't find anything that fit the description in my head.  I searched for Japanese bears, and the following image is similar to the type of animal I saw:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" /></p><p>(This image was taken from <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387" title="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387">digitaljournal.com</a>)</p><p>It's pretty close.  It's hard to trust my memory since I only saw the thing for an instant, and even though I turned around, my brain was constantly fixated on that brief visual encounter.  Any details could be slightly skewed.  I remember that it's face was dark, and it's body was brown, somewhat light brown.  Though, it could've been in the sun, which made it appear more light.  Again, it had a thin slender long face.</p><p>It's still really early in the year, so it's slender features make sense.  Bears don't get their full "puffy" figures until the end of the year.</p><p>According to some other articles, most bears shouldn't attack humans, but HELL NO, I'm not going to put that to the test.  As much as I would like to return to this path with a full day and a mountain bike, coming across another bear is way too damn risky.</p><p>Also, brown bears are on the list of endangered species.  So, even if I do encounter another bear, and if that bear attacks me, and if I'm able to defend myself, and kill it, I'll have to pay some enormous fine, and probably go to jail.  There are stories about that ALL the time despite being self defense.</p><p>I think my next attempt in the wilderness of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span> will be under a more official capacity, and in a car.</p><p><br/>Anyway, the road to Morimo through Shokawa was quite beautiful. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka Gattan Go!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go">Kamioka Gattan Go!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It currently has about 10,000 people, but there used to be a lot more.  15 years ago, there were 30,000 residents.  Many of those people were employed in the various zinc mines throughout the town and region.</p><p>And then in 2003 (I think) the zinc mine were closed.  Apparently zinc was no longer as useful as it once was, and the companies sold, closed, or abandoned the mines in the area.  Almost all the staff was cut, and residents began leaving the town and moving elsewhere for work.</p><p>With the mass exodus of residents, it no longer made sense to keep the Kamioka rail line open, so on December 1st, 2006, the rail line was closed, and abandoned.</p><p>It's still abandoned today, and is a rather prominent and visible symbol of Kamioka's urban decay.</p><p>Today, these railways have a unique present to contrast their flourishing past.</p><div class='title'><b>Gattan Go!</b></div><p>These days, you can ride the rails yourself on a bicycle contraption.  A few years after the railway closed, the NPO Kamioka-town network NPO<span class='ja'>法人神岡町づくりネットワーク</span> opened the Gattan Go! service!  2 or more people can reserve one of these railway bicycles and journey along Kamioka's railway for about 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> to 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> per person.</p><p>This past weekend, a few ALTs and I reserved a 4 person bicycle, and traveled on the old Kamioka railway. :)</p><p>The railway course is about 3km to the end, and another 3km back.  It starts from the old Hida Onsen Station and continues to the Kamioka Mining Station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" /></p><p>Here's the old Hida Onsen Station, or <span class='ja'>旧奥飛騨温泉口駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>おくひだ</span> <span class='ja'>おんせん</span> <span class='ja'>ぐち</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>).  It's now the central station for Gattan Go!  Inside there's a whole collection of trains, and some old photos of the line before it was decommissioned.  There's a Cafe outside, and a few other fun things.</p><p>We arrived a little early, so we looked at the photo spread of previous railway riders, and photos of the railway in different seasons.  It wasn't before too long that riders began returning from the time slot before us.  Almost 10 groups continued to show up around the bend, and arrive at the station.</p><p>At 4:30, the "foreman" had everyone in our time slot move into the briefing room.  He went through all the rules.  No getting off the bikes.  No stopping.  Always wear a helmet.  Blah, blah, blah…  You could still take photos, but you had to do so while staying on the bike.  Not a problem.</p><p>Luckily, our American group was the final group to leave the station, so we didn't have to worry about keeping a pace for everyone behind us.  We all hopped on the bike, and shoved off.</p><p>And it was a beautiful downhill ride. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8312.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8312.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8312.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8321.webp" /></p><p>The first station we went past is the Kamioka Oohashi (or Big Bridge) Station <span class='ja'>旧神岡大橋駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>かみおか</span> <span class='ja'>おおはし</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>), which is easy to identify with the Mushroom Public Bathroom next to the exit.  The station building was torn down, and removed.  The entrance gate is totally wide open, so anyone could easy walk to the platform, then take a look around the railway.</p><p>After continuing along further, we entered the first of two major tunnels on the route.  The first tunnel goes directly underneath the Kamioka elementary school.  And even though it's absolutely pitch black inside, it's straight, so, you can always see the entrance and exit.</p><p>Upon exited the tunnel, you reach the main Kamioka Station <span class='ja'>旧飛騨神岡駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>ひだ</span> <span class='ja'>かみおか</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>), which is elevated over the west end of town.  The former Kamioka station building is now a hair salon.  I don't know if you can actually access the station platform anymore.  I think you have to go through the inside of the building, and it was closed when I checked.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" /></p><p>After we passed through Kamioka Station, we entered the second tunnel of the route, and this one is much longer than the first.  The "elementary school" tunnel is about 600m, I think?  This tunnel, the "Otsu Shrine" tunnel, is a bit longer at almost 1 kilometer.  And it curves in the middle, so there's a point where it's absolutely pitch black and you can't see either entrance or exit.  </p><p>It's just you (and your team) peddling into the darkness with no actual aim.</p><p>It's a bit creepy…</p><p>But, before we reached the light of the end of the tunnel, and were suddenly bathed in the light and heat of the day.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8355.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8361.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8369.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8369.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8369.webp" /></p><p>And after another 500m we go to the end of the line, the Kamioka Mining Station <span class='ja'>旧神岡鉱山前駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>かみおか</span> <span class='ja'>こうざん</span> <span class='ja'>まえ</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>).  At this point, an attendant stopped everyone and turned the bikes around for the return journey.  We got to take a break, drink some water, and relax for a little while.</p><p>Before too long, we're back on the bike, and returning to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" /></p><p>Going from the Onsen Station to the Mining Station is pretty easy because the route is generally downhill.  It still feels really flat, though.  The return route is a fucking monster.  There were so many parts on the route where we kept peddling as much as we could, and we were still slowing down, and dragging.  I don't know if it was the bike we had, or if we're just that out of shape, but it was an actual workout to climb the tracks back to central.</p><p>We finally returned to the Onsen Station at 5:35.  A good 5 minutes late. :)  Good thing we were scheduled the last time slot of the day, and were the final group to depart.</p><p>Exhausted, and beat, we returned to our cars, and drove to a local yakiniku place for some delicious dinner.</p><p>Overall, it was a pretty fantastic and unique experience.  All of these old stations are pretty prominent in Kamioka, and after seeing them for the first time, I really wanted to get a better view.  Riding the bikes along these tracks was a great way to see everything up close, and take part of the history that was once the Kamioka railway.</p><p>As we finally departed Kamioka for the night, the tiny little castle shone beautifully in the darkening sky.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" /></p><p>Another way to experience the old railways is on youtube.  There's a few videos that people recorded from back in the day of the train traveling from the current Kamioka Inotani Station <span class='ja'>神岡猪谷駅</span> all the way to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p>This video was recorded in 1991: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY</a></p><p>And this one is quite a bit more recent: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI</a></p><p>In both videos, you can clearly see a whole lot of tanker cars parked at the Onsen and Mining stations, which carried all the zinc and whatever else they extracted from the Kamioka mines.</p><p>That first video is really helpful because it lists all the stations of the now abandoned line between the Inotani Station and the Onsen station:</p><p><span class='ja'>猪谷</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>茂住</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>漆山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡大橋</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨温泉</span></p><p>There's just 3 more stations outside of the central Kamioka area that are decommissioned: Hida Nakayama <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span>, Mozumi <span class='ja'>茂住</span>, and Urushiyama <span class='ja'>漆山</span>.  From the parts of the rail line we weren't able to ride on, there are some really beautiful bridges, and tunnels that are very very long.  Especially between the Mining station and the Urushiyama Station <span class='ja'>漆山駅</span>.  I think this requires some more exploring in the future. :)</p><div class='title'><b><i>Update</i></b></div><p>Near the end of summer vacation, I went to these abandoned rail stations: <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-railway" title="/kamioka-railway">September 1st</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Utsue Yosohachi Waterfalls 宇津江四十八滝" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/utsue-yosohachi-waterfalls">Utsue Yosohachi Waterfalls 宇津江四十八滝</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 19, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the town of Kokufu, which is part of Takayama City, there's a beautiful set of waterfalls named the <span class='ja'>宇津江四十八滝</span>, or Utsue Yosohachi Waterfalls.  Though, from the name <span class='ja'>四十八</span>, which literally translates as 48, it's really easy to think that there are 48 waterfalls coming down the mountain.  That's what I thought when I saw the sign on the side of the road.  The following story is how that name came to be:</p><div class='title'><b>The Legend</b></div><p><i>The Japanese text is from the website.  I did my best translating it into English.</i></p><p>Once upon a time, in a village, there was a young man named Yoso-hachi <span class='ja'>よそ八</span>, who lived with his mother <span class='ja'>かか様</span>.  In the Spring, the mother caught a cold.  Because of how old she was, Yoso-hachi worried about her a lot.  His mother loved fish, so Yoso-hachi went to the river to catch an <span class='ja'>イワナ</span>, or Salvelinus (which is a kind of salmon).  Unfortunately, he couldn't catch any fish that day, and he wondered why.  He couldn't return home empty handed.  In the mountains of Utsue <span class='ja'>宇津江</span>, there was a big pond with a large serpent.  Yoso-hachi didn't know where this was, but somehow he got there.  The pond was so calm it looked like a mirror.  He cast his line in the pond, and was able to catch a beautiful shiny Salvelinus of 30cm.  Nearby, wrapped around a spotted chestnut tree, was the serpent.  It's eyes appeared to glow, but Yoso-hachi did not notice it.  With his fish, Yoso-hachi raced back home to heal his mother.  However, from the serpent's magical energy, Yoso-hachi had caught a fever, and was now bedridden, too.</p><p><span class='ja'>昔むかし、この里に「よそ八（はち）」という若者が「かか様」（母）と住んでいました。</span> <span class='ja'>ある年の春、かか様はちょっとした風邪がもとで寝込んでしまいました。なんといっても寄る年波なので、</span> <span class='ja'>起きて出る元気もなかったのです。</span> <span class='ja'>よそ八は魚の好きなかか様に食わせてやりたいとイワナをとりに行きました。</span> <span class='ja'>どうしたのやら、その日に限ってちっとも釣れないので、我を忘れてどんどん奥へわけいってしまいました。</span> <span class='ja'>宇津江の山奥には大沼があって大蛇がいるという話でした。よそ八は知らないうちに、とうとうその沼に来てしまいました。</span> <span class='ja'>沼は鏡のように静まり返っていました。釣り糸をたれると一尺（</span>30ｃｍ<span class='ja'>）もあるイワナが面白いほど釣れたのです。</span> <span class='ja'>ひょっと見ると、沼のふちの栗の木に大蛇が巻きついてランランと光る目で見ているので、びっくりして一目散に家へ逃げ帰りましたが、</span> <span class='ja'>大蛇の妖気に打たれて高い熱を出して寝込んでしまいました。</span></p><p>That night, he was visited by a young woman who nursed him back to health.  Every night for 10 days, this woman visited Yoso-hachi like it was a dream.  She finally spoke, "I am serpent who lives in the pond of Utsue <span class='ja'>宇津江</span>.  I have trained a thousand years by the sea, and a thousand years in the mountains, and now I can finally ascend to heaven.  Because you've shown great respect and care for your mother (<span class='ja'>親孝行</span> / <span class='ja'>おやこうこう</span> / Filial Piety), I have given you my blood.  I will create a storm and ascend to heaven.  And I shall never return."  The young woman then disappeared.  Later, a great monk heard this story and replied, "Wow!  You saved the serpent!"  And from that day, Yoso-hachi began praying to the Buddhist god Acala (<span class='ja'>不動明王</span> / <span class='ja'>ふどうみょうおう</span>).  21 days later, there was a great thunderstorm.  Lightning lit the skies, thunder cracked through the woods, and the rain was immense.  The serpent had now ascended to heaven to become a dragon.</p><p><span class='ja'>その夜、美しい旅の娘が訪ねてきて親切に看病してくれました。数十日後、すっかり元気になったよそ八の夢に娘が現れ、</span> <span class='ja'>「私は大沼に住む大蛇です。海に千年、山に千年の修行が終わったので、天に昇らなければなりません。親孝行のあなたを</span> <span class='ja'>助けてあげようと私の血をしぼって飲ませました。今の私は嵐を呼ぶ力も、天に昇る気力もなくなってしまいました。」</span> <span class='ja'>と告げ、二度と戻ってきませんでした。</span> <span class='ja'>話を聞いた偉い行者が「よし、わしがその大蛇を救って進ぜよう」と断食して不動明王に願掛けして祈祷を始めました。</span> <span class='ja'>・・・そして満願の二十一日目・・・天にわかにかき曇り稲妻が光り、雷鳴するどく大嵐となり、風を呼び雲を起こした大蛇は</span> <span class='ja'>龍になって天へ昇って行きました。</span></p><p>The Next day, when Yoso-hachi went to the valley, there were some 10 waterfalls carved out of the rugged rocks that shined brilliantly.  The big pond had dried up.  The chestnut tree, from the roots to its branches, was wrenched and twisted.  In later years, Koubou Daishi <span class='ja'>弘法大師</span>, a monk who had traveled to various countries, remarked, "Yoso-hachi is the reincarnation of Acala (or Fudoson / <span class='ja'>不動尊</span> / <span class='ja'>ふどうさん</span>).  In Buddhism, his name, Yo-So-Hachi, represents <span class='ja'>四</span> (yo), <span class='ja'>十</span> (so), <span class='ja'>八</span> (hachi)."  After that, everyone began to call the waterfalls <span class='ja'>四十八滝</span>, or Yoso-hachi waterfalls.  The waterfalls also became known for cleansing impurities.  This famous tale is very old, and these are all the facts that remain of it.</p><p><span class='ja'>翌日行ってみると渓はごつごつの岩肌が出て大小数十段の滝ができてキラキラと輝いていました。</span> <span class='ja'>そして大沼はすっかり干上がって、栗の木は根元から枝先までねじれてしまっていたのです。</span> <span class='ja'>後年、諸国修行の途上立ち寄った弘法大師が「その行者は不動尊の化身であり、よそ八（四十八）とは仏法四十八願を意味するものであろう。」</span> <span class='ja'>と言われ、以後この滝を四十八滝と呼ぶようになったと言うことです。</span> <span class='ja'>また四十八滝は不浄を忌み、不浄なことをすると必ず大夕立となり、昔より水乞いのとしても有名で各種の文献に史実が残されています。</span></p><div class='title'><b>Interpretation</b></div><p>So, again, <span class='ja'>四十八</span> literally translates to 48.  <span class='ja'>四</span> (yon) is kanji for 4.  <span class='ja'>十</span> (juu) is kanji for 10.  And <span class='ja'>八</span> (hachi) is kanji for 8.  But, kanji have many different readings.  From the story, <span class='ja'>四</span> can be read as 'yo', <span class='ja'>十</span> can be read as 'so', and <span class='ja'>八</span> is still read as 'hachi'.  Yoso-hachi, again, is the main character's name and the waterfalls are named after him.  Even the road signs in Kokofu mistranslate this as Shijuuhachi.  (Shi is the most secondary reading for 4 in Japanese.)</p><p>The Japanese language does this a lot with numbers.  That concept is known as Goroawase <span class='ja'>語呂合わせ</span>.  I wrote a little bit about this a while ago: <a href="/old/v7/goroawase" title="/goroawase">November 7th, 2009</a>.  I think the most well-known one is 39.  39 translates to <span class='ja'>さんきゅう</span> or san-kyuu.  Saying "san-kyuu" sounds like Thank you.  So, Japanese people will try to get phone numbers with 39.  License plates, too.  They'll tack it on the end of their email address.  There's also a chain of a retail stores called 39.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>滝</span> / Waterfalls</b></div><p>Anyway, let's get on to the photos.</p><p>It takes a little while to drive to this area from Route 41.  There's plenty of parking, though.  The whole area is like a camp ground with a large flower field, and a hot spring museum, too. :)  As you walk up the road, you reach the bottom of the hiking trails that lead up Utsue <span class='ja'>宇津江</span> mountain.  And from there each waterfall is clearly marked with a little story about itself.

I wonder if this pond is supposed to represent the original pond that Yosohachi found all those years ago.  Or maybe it actually is the original location.  There's a huge mound of dirt near the pond, too, so maybe that's his grave, or something.</p><div class='title'><b>Viewing Platform</b></div><p>Just after Aori Waterfall (number 9), there's a break in the trees, and a raised platform that allows you see just how far you've climbed so far.

Thousands of people come from around Japan, and around the world to view the beautiful festival floats, or yatai, as they are display during the day, and paraded through town at night.  I attended the Spring festival this year, and took a bunch of pictures.  You can view those here: <a href="/old/v7/takayama-spring-matsuri" title="/takayama-spring-matsuri">April 17th, 2014</a>.</p><p>But, if you aren't able to make it to the festivals, there are 2 museums in town that showcase festival floats, and you can view them anytime throughout the year.  There's the Takayama Festival Float Museum (<span class='ja'>高山祭屋台会館</span>), or Yatai-kaikan for short.  And there's the Hida Takayama Festival "Forest" (<span class='ja'>飛騨高山まつりの森</span>), or simply Matsuri no Mori.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>まつりの森</span> / Matsuri no Mori</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7707.webp" /></p><p><span class='ja'>森</span> or mori, means forest in Japanese, though this museum really isn't a forest.  Even the plaque outside the building says, "Takayama Matsuri Museum."  It's located on the south end of town, and sits next two several other museums.  There's the tea ceremony museum, and a butterfly and insect museum.  There's also a playground in the forest behind the museums.  Maybe that's where the forest name comes from.</p><p>But, this place is definitely way more animated than a typical Japanese museum.  And while it looks very very small from the outside, the whole museum is actually house inside of an expanded geo-dome found in the hill. </p><p>As shown below, there's a long hallway dug into the mountain leading to the geo-dome.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7703.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7702.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7533.webp" /></p><p>Along the left-side of the hallway leading to the geo-dome are miniature scale replicas of the 11 floats featured in the Autumn Takayama Festival.</p><p>On the right-side, there's some information showing how this museum was built.  There's also information about festival floats and which festivals actually use and display floats.  Apparently, there's only 6 festivals in Japan that actually use these kinds of floats.</p><p>There's the Takayama Festival <span class='ja'>高山祭</span> and the Furukawa Festival <span class='ja'>古川祭</span>.  Both of which are (basically) where I live in Gifu, Japan.  Up north, there's the Takaoka Kuruma-yama Festival <span class='ja'>高岡御車山祭</span>.  In Kyoto, their Gion Festival <span class='ja'>京都祇園祭</span> uses them too.  To the west of Tokyo in Saitama, the city of Chichibu has a Night Festival <span class='ja'>秩父夜祭</span> with floats.  Apparently, that one has fireworks, too. :)  And finally, there's the Hitachi Nagaremono Festival? <span class='ja'>日立風流物祭</span>.  I dunno.

There is a tapestry, embroidered with gold thread, of Daikokusama (one of the seven gods) with several straw sacks of rice, and Karako on the back of the float.

He envisioned a float that is "Not only for adults, but, one that children could enjoy as well."  This float was designed with a four-layer structure; something not traditionally seen in Takayama Festival floats.  Its main characteristic is its heavy and sturdy build.  The marionette, positioned on the top level, was made by a Nagoya doll maker (Yorozuya, Nihei).

Being that the rooster possesses the Five Virtues of "Wisdom, Fighting, Spirit, Courage, Benevolence and Trust," as well as "Family Safety," "Martial Happiness", and "Fruitfullness", this float is an expression of the ideal family.  There is a carving in the shape of a lattice located in the middle and lower levels of the float.  The curtain with a golden cock and peony design on the back of the float, is made with woolen cloth and embroidered with gold and silk thread.</p></div><br/></div><br/><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Marionette displays</b></div><p>About every 10 minutes in Matsuri no Mori, the lights dim down, and several spotlights focus on a particular act.  There are 7 different acts and they perform once every hour.  Here's the following schedule with 9 o'clock as an example:</p><p><span class='ja'>神楽台</span> / Kaguratai // 9:00 - 9:04<br/><span class='ja'>夫婦獅子</span> / <span class='ja'>めおとじし</span> / Shishi // 9:08 - 9:15<br/><span class='ja'>銭太鼓</span> / <span class='ja'>ぜにだいこ</span> // 9:15 - 9:18<br/><span class='ja'>金時台</span> / Kintokitai // 9:23 - 9:27<br/><span class='ja'>福寿台</span> / Fukujutai // 9:30 - 9:35<br/><span class='ja'>世界一大太鼓</span> / 9:40 - 9:45<br/><span class='ja'>金鶏台</span> / Kinkeitai // 9:50 - 9:55</p><p>I arrived at the museum in the middle of the Zenidaiko dancing, so I was only able to view the last 4.</p><p>As mentioned, in previous articles about festival floats, one of the main attractions of the float are the marionettes attached, and the complicated dances they perform.  Each float's marionette's dance is meant to tell some kind of story and really highlight the meaning behind the float.</p><p>The following photos are from Kintokitai, Fukujutai, and Kinkeitai.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7581.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7617.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140514_matsuri_mori/IMG_7684.webp" /></p><p>The Kintokitai dance features a boy either attacking or warding off a bear on the very end of the float.  He dances and spins around, and at the end the bear (or the spirit of the bear) is defeated.</p><p>The Fukujutai dance features a man walking towards a peach and performing its dance.  He moves around, then a man with a cannon emerges from the peach.  That man moves around then fires a bunch of confetti out of the cannon into the crowd.</p><p>The Kinkeitai dance is a little more tame and simple.  It just features the marionette moving to the end of the float, dancing.  Then the man turns into a demon, and continues to dance.  Then he turns back into a human, and completes the dance.</p><p>Also, I watched the <span class='ja'>世界一大太鼓</span>, or The World's Largest Giant Taiko Drum performance.  3 marionettes turn to the drums, and begin beating a song.  It's a little creepy since these marionettes are life size, and they bow before and after the performance, which is a very "human" Japanese thing to do.</p><div class='title'><b>The Museum</b></div><p>Overall, I really like the museum.  I think it shows off the Festival floats and marionette dances really well, and in a unique atmosphere, too.  Though, I think it's just one step away from a Chucky Cheese, or Shony's Pizza Place.  It's all very animatronic, and the spotlights really focus your attention.  There's an announcer that always says what's going on, and how long before the next performance.</p><p>Also, inside the museum is a Crystal Cave, which was closed for some reason.  Maybe it's only open on the weekend, or something.</p><p>Matsuri no Mori is a bit expensive, too, at 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>.  I think by American standards, that's not too bad, but Japanese museums are usually half that price.  Of course, those museums lack that flare, and experience built into Matsuri no Mori.  This museum is very hands-on, and let's you have fun.  It might be worth the price if there's some kind of package deal that includes all the other museums in the area for a discount price.</p><p>But, I dunno.  I thought it was neat, and there was plenty of good information.  It's certainly more interesting than the Yaitai-kaikan.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Yamada Elementary 山田小" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/yamada-elementary">Yamada Elementary 山田小</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In the Hida region, there's Hida City, Takayama City, Shirakawa Village, and Gero City.  Hida City is directly north of Takayama City.  And it too! had a governmental restructuring in recent years.  </p><p>In 2004, the towns of Furukawa and Kamioka joined with the villages of Kawai and Miyagawa to form Hida City.  There aren't too many schools, either.  There are 2 junior high schools, and 4 elementary.  There's also a combined junior high and elementary.  So, really, technically, there's 3 and 5.</p><p>However, like most of Japan, there used to be more.  Much more!  After the formation of Hida City, they closed a couple of schools and had those students filter into the larger ones.</p><p>One such school is the following: Yamada elementary in Hida City.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_yamada_es/IMG_7178_stitch_t.webp" /></p><p>This school is really easy to find.  I didn't even know it was here until I drove by it on the way to Kamioka.  It's directly on the side of the road in the middle of the Yamada neighborhood of Kamioka Town.</p><p>I'm guessing that it closed within the last 10 years, though.  The building isn't really falling apart.  Looking through the windows, there's plenty of crap piled up, and some things were simply left there without any thought.</p><p>The gym is still in use.  In fact, the plaque in front now states Yamada School Gym, rather than Yamada Elementary.  The school yard was still being used for baseball practice, too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka &quot;Big&quot; Festival 神岡大祭" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-big-festival">Kamioka "Big" Festival 神岡大祭</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

There were also plenty of people that later said they saw me at the festival, which started some good conversations about teaching English, or Kendo, or whatever.</p><p>I think it was worth it to go. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka Castle 神岡城" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-castle">Kamioka Castle 神岡城</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's one of my favorite places in the Hida region.  It's a small town of about 10,000 residents sandwiched in a valley between two mountains.  </p><p>In the entire Hida region, I think it's the only place that has a standing castle.  There are plenty of castles in Gifu prefecture.  And Takayama has a former castle site, where you can hike.  Furukawa has a former castle site, too.  But, I'm pretty sure, Kamioka Castle in the only standing castle in the Hida region.</p><p>Kamioka Castle is located on the top of the one of the hills (or mountains) in town, and overlooks the entire downtown area.  It's right next to the Kamioka junior high school.  The castle area has 3 attractions. </p><p><span class='ja'>神岡城</span> - There's the castle itself: Kamioka Castle.</p><p><span class='ja'>鉱山資料館</span> / <span class='ja'>こうざん</span> <span class='ja'>しりょうかん</span> - There's the building you first see when you enter the area.  And where you buy the tickets, too.  It's the Mining Museum.</p><p><span class='ja'>旧松葉家</span> / <span class='ja'>ふるまつばいえ</span> - And there's a old style farm house entitled the Old Matsuba House.</p><p>One ticket buys you entry to all 3 buildings.  But, I was really interested in the castle.</p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Castle</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6746.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6746.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6746.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6754_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6754_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6754_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6754_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140506_kamioka_castle/IMG_6754_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>According to the internet, the original castle was built in 1554 by Yamagata Masakage.  It stood for over 100 years until the shogunate passed a law saying a daimyo may only have one castle in their ruling domain.  The castle was rebuilt in 1970 as the structure it is today.</p><p>It's not a very big castle, and I think most people would argue that the 460<span class='ja'>円</span> sticker price is not worth it.  Inside, you can find some artifacts, as well as several samurai armor on display.  I think it's okay for a day trip, and you have a great view. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takayama (from Kita-yama)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takayama-from-kitayama">Takayama (from Kita-yama)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's one of the center-most places in Japan, and on the west-end of Japan's most major mountain range.  The municipality of Takayama makes it the largest city in Japan based on land area.  9 years ago, it absorbed many of the neighboring villages in a governmental restructuring.  Many of these villages are nothing but mountainous forested wilderness with pockets of neighborhoods.</p><p>Takayama has about 90,000 residents.  Of that population, about 65,000 live in the central Takayama City, which is where I live.</p><p>I live at the northeastern base of one of the more prominent mountains in Takayama, Kita-yama.  At least, I think that's the name.  From my apartment, when I walk into the center of town, whether it be for drinking, or taking the train elsewhere, I have to go around the mountain one way or the other.</p><p>Recently, I've been taking a different route.  The path that leads straight up the mountain, and back down the other side.  It's much faster saving about 5 minutes.  And it's great exercise, too. :)</p><p>From Kita-yama, you have a great view of the entire downtown area.  Every time I walk past this amazing view, I can't help but take photos, even though they're the same ones I've taken several times before.</p><p>So, here you are.  There are photos I've taken from the early morning, mid-day, the evening, the sunset, and at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Downtown Takayama</b></div><p>(These are all panoramic shots, too, so you

recognize.</p><p>In these two close-ups you can see the gate of Hachiman Shrine.  That's on the left end of the image.  On the right side, the square building with the triangle expanse shooting into the sky is Takayama City Hall.  It's where all the government in Takayama operates.</p><p>Between the two, landmarks is a white rectangular building.  That's one of the elementary schools I teach at, Nishi ES.  It actually has very few students.  Which may seem a bit weird being near the center of town, but there are a few other elementary schools nearby that cover the larger areas.  It's just stuck in the middle.</p><p>Anyway, here they are in the morning, before the work day, and in the evening after.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4892.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4892.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4892.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4489.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Sunset</b></div><p>And here's the sun setting over the west end of town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4485.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4485.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_4485.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_5870.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_5870.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_5870.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_5918.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_5918.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140415_takayama/IMG_5918.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/takayama/8">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/takayama/6">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
