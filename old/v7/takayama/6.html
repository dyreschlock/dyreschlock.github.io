| September 20, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Takayama City <span class='ja'>高山市</span> is known in Japan as a city that has kept its Edo period roots.  The old streets and sake breweries in the heart of the city, and being completely surrounded by mountains and nature convey these old feelings.  There really isn't another place like it.</p><p>Before it was created in this image, Takayama was the site of a few battles.  In the 1500s, some dude named Yoritsuna seized the Hida province and built the Matsukura castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span> to defend it.  Some decades later, Kanamori <span class='ja'>金森</span> was ordered to attack Yoritsuna and capture Hida, who then ruled the Echizen Ono Castle <span class='ja'>越前大野城</span>, which you might remember as the 3rd castle on my <a href="/old/v7/20-castle-stamp-rally" title="/20-castle-stamp-rally">20 Castle Stamp Rally Card</a>.  </p><p>Kanamori battled and defeated Yoritsuna in 1585, and became the ruler of Hida.  Matsukura Castle was a warrior's castle, though.  It was built for battling and defending, but this is not what Kanamori and his clan wanted for Takayama.  In 1588, Kanamori began construction of the Takayama Castle <span class='ja'>高山城</span>, and basically created Takayama in the image of a castle town.  He's basically the founder of modern day Takayama, and you can find all kinds of info and artifacts about Kanamori in the Takayama Museum of History and Art.  After his capture of Takayama, it basically became a peaceful place.</p><p>Matsukura Castle was abandoned, and eventually destroyed somehow.  The rules of this castle (and the Takayama Castle) are still present today.  Though, the Takayama Castle ruins aren't nearly as interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Castle <span class='ja'>松倉城</span></b></div><p>The site of the Matsukura Castle is located near current Matsukura Junior High School <span class='ja'>松倉中</span>, on the southwest corner of the heart of Takayama City.  This time I actually went hiking with a friend. :)  After lunch, we began around 2pm.</p><p>To get to the ruins, drive up the hill past Hida no Sato <span class='ja'>飛騨の里</span>, and you'll find a plateau where you can park.  From there, you will find a path that leads up into the forest.  It takes about 10 minutes if you're driving from Takayama Station.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6605.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6612.webp" /></p><p>The path is only 250 meters, and it takes about 5 or 10 minutes to hike through the slightly rocky terrain.  Being in such close proximity to the city allows the trails to be easily well kept, and well traveled..  There were really no traces of any large animals along the trail, either.  But there were plenty of mushrooms.</p><p>Heavier rocks are embedded in the trail as we continued, and then came across a partially collapsed edge of a castle wall.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6619.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6628.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6634.webp" /></p><p>The trails leads past the wall, and around the main wall of the castle ruins.  There were trees and grass, but the area was still very rocky.  The trail led almost completely around the main wall of the castle, and opened to a clearing where a portion of Takayama City was visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6636_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6636_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6636_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6636_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6636_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6655_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6655_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6655_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6655_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6655_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But next, was the summit.  Just a few quick steps to climb, and we had a much more wide open view of lower Takayama, and the Enako neighborhood <span class='ja'>江名子町</span>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6674.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6665_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the above photo..  On the bottom of the photo is lower Takayama, where Hie Junior High School <span class='ja'>日枝中</span> and Sanno Elementary School <span class='ja'>三王小</span> are prominent and clearly visible.  The area above that is the Enako neighborhood <span class='ja'>江名子町</span>, which has Enako Elementary <span class='ja'>江名子小</span>.  That school is probably visible in there somewhere.</p><p>Unfortunately, there are plenty of trees on this mountain which obstructed the full view of Takayama City.  It was still possible to see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6689.webp">Nakayama Junior High School <span class='ja'>中山中</span></a>, and the Mieda area in the north.  Further west, you could see some of the Shingu area, but it was almost all obstructed by trees.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6690.webp" /></p><p>It would really help if this summit had a platform that went up another 10 meters.  You could see over the trees, and completely view Takayama.  Maybe they can't build one, though.  I think this site is protected under some historical preservation law.</p><p>Overall, the castle ruins were interesting, but having the view obstructed kinda blows the full experience of the castle.  My friend was reminded a haiku poem that mentions the history one can feel in such a place.  More than 400 years ago, hundreds of warriors and soldiers lost their lives in battle defending this castle, and their souls linger and shape the life growing on this mountain.</p><div class='title'><b>Harayama <span class='ja'>原山</span></b></div><p>The Matsukura Castle ruins was only the first thing on my list of things to do in this area.  We went back to the parking area, got some water, and took a look at the area map.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6701.webp" /></p><p>Our next destination was the summit of Harayama, or Mt. Hara, which was only another kilometer away by hiking.  The whole area was a loop, but we already did most of the heavy climbing in my car.</p><p>We continued into the forest going the opposite direction of Matsukura Castle to reach the summit, and the trail was quite a bit more rough.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6704.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6709.webp" /></p><p>Some areas were covered with some heavy rocks erupting from the ground.  Other areas slightly covered with foliage.  At some point, there was even a climbing rope provided to help us walk up a 40/45 degree incline.  The map indicated this was a walking path, but as my friend continued to mention, this wasn't really walking at all.  It was hiking.</p><p>I took some pictures, but we continued to press on.  We were supposed to come across some kind of house marked on the map, but we didn't see anything.  After traveling a full kilometer we reached a fork in the road and a sign that said we reached the walking path we thought we were on.  Apparently we took some kind of rough shortcut.  Bleh, whatever.</p><p>100 meters ahead was the summit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6711.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6712_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6763_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6772_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From here you could clearly see the entire Shingu neighborhood <span class='ja'>新宮町</span>, downtown Takayama, a little bit of Nyukawa <span class='ja'>丹生川</span>, and off in the west you could see one of the prominent neighborhoods in <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6753.webp">Kiyomi <span class='ja'>清見</span></a>.</p><p>You could clearly see <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6754.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6754.webp">Shingu Elementary <span class='ja'>新宮小</span></a>, which was in the middle of their Sports Festival. :D  We could even hear the announcements from the summit, too.  We were probably only 2 kilometers away at most.</p><p>The view was gorgeous considering the heavy clouds from the morning.  This has been a running theme in the current weather of Takayama.  It gets really cold at night, which brings in all these clouds, and fog.  In the morning, it's overcast, and gloomy.  Throughout the morning, it's still overcast, but the clouds begin to break apart with the increasing temperature.  Eventually the sky opens up in mid-day.  Then gets covered up again as the sun sets.</p><p>The tallest looking mountain in the whole view was <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6785.webp">Ibuseyama <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span></a>, which I visited a few weeks ago: <a href="/old/v7/ibuseyama" title="/ibuseyama">September 3rd</a>.</p><p>We took in the view for a while, then made our way back to the car.  We took the correct suggested route on the way back, though, which was excellent for some variety.</p><div class='title'><b>Kanodoko-iwa <span class='ja'>かなどこ岩</span></b></div><p>The first thing we came across was a big rock label Kanodoko-iwa.  Kanodoko translates as Anvil.  Iwa is a big rock.

Despite being the correct "walking trail", the terrain is still rather rough and rocky.  I brought up Skyrim as a conversation topic because I always think about that game when hiking through all these wooded areas.  In 2 months, after it snows, it's going to start looking a lot more like Skyrim, too. :)</p><p>The woods open up a little bit, and we come across the back end of the house marked on the map.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6843.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6843.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6843.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6851.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6851.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140920_harayama/IMG_6851.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Matsukura Kannon Temple <span class='ja'>松倉観音堂</span></b></div><p>We come across the Matsukura temple devoted to the Buddhist god, Kannon or Guanyin or Guanshiyin, whatever.

Also inside is a large space for anyone to meet and hang out.</p><p>We continue to the front of the temple, and there's a another structure, a stage.

Every year on August 9th and 10th, a festival is held to pray and celebrate good health and a good upcoming harvest as fall approached.  Over those two days, members of the temple create those infamous Hida horse paintings for the townspeople and anyone willing to make the hike to their temple.  The artists work nonstop from the 9th to the 10th creating these painting and celebrating good fortune.

| September 7, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today was a beautiful September day in Takayama.  There was a little rain over night, but the weather completely cleared up, and today had completely blue skies all day.  Throughout the summer, there have been many rainy days.  Nice weather like this only happens for a few hours at a time.  Not for an entire day.</p><p>The staff at one of my school's recommended that I hike a nearby mountain named <b>Juunigatake</b> <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳</span> located in the village of Nyukawa <span class='ja'>丹生川</span> which is within the borders of Takayama City.  Juunigatake literally translates as Mt. 12.</p><p>After a little Internet searching, I found out how to get there, and took off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5763.webp" /></p><p>Google Maps had brought me to a small pocket of farms in the Gonbo <span class='ja'>根肩</span> neighborhood of Nyukawa at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833">N36° 10' 34.68", E137° 22' 37.14"</a>.  Between a few fields of rice was a road that led up into the mountains.  At the entrance to the road was a temple, and several signs that warned about forest fires.  Also, near the entrance were some sandbags left over from the flash flooding that occurred a few weeks ago.</p><p>I started to climb the trail with my car, but the road was incredibly damaged by the flood.  Narrow mountain roads make excellent canals for running flood water.  I'm sure that was a decent dirt trail before, but all the loose dirt had been washed away leaving rocks, and some remaining mud.  Some storm drains had been <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5773.webp">knocked out</a> of their positions, so <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5775.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5775.webp">I fixed it</a>, and continued.</p><p>In my mind, I kept thinking that I should turn around.  One of my car tires will get stuck, or my car will bottom-out, or one of these rocks will puncture my tire.  This is actually dangerous.  Sense and reason finally prevailed.  I turned my car around, exited the trail, parked, and began walking up the road.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5772.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5776.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5783.webp" /></p><p>My car did not make it very far, and it was very sobering to continue this trail on foot and see just how doomed this journey would have been.  One stretch of road was half-collapsed with a fissure splitting it in two.  Nearby rock slides had washed out part of the road, too.  It was totally impassable by car.</p><p>After almost a kilometer hike up the steep trail, the forest began to open up, and grass had began to creep into the trail.  The blue sky was overhead, and I came across a couple of buildings.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5792.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5804.webp" /></p><p>The road forked to the left which had two old homes.  There are here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222">N36° 10' 49.89", E137° 22' 29.72"</a>.  Abandoned, and left to rot.  The doors were locked tight, and the windows were boarded.  One of homes had some old tools underneath part of the roof, but nothing seemed like it had any normal use.  I did not pry.</p><p>A few more meters down this road led to the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5796.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5796.webp">back of someone's farm</a>.  There were some vegetable fields, and plenty of rice fields too.  I could see the owner near his house, too.  He was trimming weeds near his home.  I guess he must own these rundown homes.  Or at least, perhaps, he's the current property owner.</p><p>What I found VERY curious was I could clear see modern vehicles parked at his house.  One of which was another small kei car like mine.  How the hell did he get those up here?</p><p>Well, after going back to the fork in the road, and continuing, I came across pavement.  Apparently this washed up, damaged road was not the correct way to get to my mountain, and I'm an idiot.  I reexamined my map, then went back to my car to meet this road on the other side.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140907_juunigatake/IMG_5836.webp" /></p><p>Hey, look at that.  After driving the correct way into the mountain, there's an actual sign and a map detailing where I'm supposed to go.

I'll work my way up there eventually.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline - First Attempt</b></div><table><tr><td>10:20am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Nyuukawa Gonbo <span class='ja'>丹生川根方</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833">N36° 10' 34.68", E137° 22' 37.14"</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:35am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Farm Houses</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.180525,137.3749222">N36° 10' 49.89", E137° 22' 29.72"</a></td></tr><tr><td>10:55am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to my Car <span class='ja'>車に帰り</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1763,137.3769833">N36° 10' 34.68", E137° 22' 37.14"</a></td></tr></table><div class='title'><b>Timeline - Second Attempt</b></div><table><tr><td>11:05am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Juunigatake Entrance <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳入口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1855056,137.3796556">N36° 11' 7.82", E137° 22' 46.76"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:15am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Juunigatake Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444">N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:35am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>歩き登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889">N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:45am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Fork, and Tori Gate <span class='ja'>鳥居</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19645,137.3848778">N36° 11' 47.22", E137° 23' 5.56"</a></td></tr><tr><td>11:50am</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Summit <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳</span> <span class='ja'>峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.19715,137.3865722">N36° 11' 49.74", E137° 23' 11.66"</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Eastern Summit <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳</span> <span class='ja'>東峰</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1967528,137.3879111">N36° 11' 48.31", E137° 23' 16.48"</a></td></tr><tr><td>12:25pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Outhouse</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12:30pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Water Well</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>12:45pm</td><td>by walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>歩き登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1939583,137.3844889">N36° 11' 38.25", E137° 23' 4.16"</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:05pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Juunigatake Trail Entrance <span class='ja'>十二ヶ岳登山口</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1873306,137.3897444">N36° 11' 14.39", E137° 23' 23.08"</a></td></tr><tr><td>1:25pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Nyuukawa Dam <span class='ja'>丹生川ダム</span></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2178361,137.37015" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2178361,137.37015">N36° 13' 4.21", E137° 22' 12.54"</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ibuseyama 猪臥山" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ibuseyama">Ibuseyama 猪臥山</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 3, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On the border between Takayama City, and Hida City, between Kiyomi Village and Furukawa Town, there lies a mountain named Ibuseyama <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span>.  The website said it was famous, but when I mentioned it to a few local teachers, none of them had heard of it.  The peak of Ibuseyama is about an hours drive from Furukawa, so I decided to take a look.</p><p>Out of Furukawa, there's a road named Hwy 90, and it acts as a shortcut for people in western Hida City to reach the tollway entrance in Kiyomi, named the Hida Kiyomi IC <span class='ja'>飛騨清見</span>IC.  The road starts off rather large and straight, but there are pockets of houses that do not allow the road to continue this way.  The road windily climbs up the side of a mountain and through a forest.  At its peak, the road levels off, widens, and continues straight once again.  After the road widens, it goes through a near 4.5km long tunnel, and then you're nearly at the tollway entrance.</p><p>To get to Ibuseyama, you need to turn into a neighborhood right before this tunnel.  This one: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111">N36° 13' 14.45", E137° 9' 0.4"</a>.  In fact, this very turn can be seen from the peak of Ibuseyama.  The road becomes very narrow, and the forest becomes thicker, and more debris is scattered on the road since very few people actually go this way.</p><p>After 20 minutes from Furukawa, you reach a very remote area of Kiyomi Village <span class='ja'>清見村</span>, the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'>小鳥町</span>.  Here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222">N36° 12' 22.42", E137° 6' 19.88"</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" /></p><p>There's a crossroads here.  I stopped my car, and got out to take this photo.  After standing, there was absolutely no sound.  No running water.  No wind.  No animals.  Nothing.  It was dead silent.  Once crossed into this remote area of Kiyomi, it was like I entered a dead zone.  Maybe it was haunted.</p><p>Anyway, at this crossroads, I had two choices. Make a left and continue to the mountain, or continue straight through the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'>小鳥町</span> of Kiyomi. I went left.</p><p>The road is paved, which is nice, but much of the pavement is cracked and bulging from the movement of rock underneath, erosion by water and melted snow on the top, or landslides that had previously taken out part of the road.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>My little car continued to climb.  I went past several hairpin turns exceeding 180 degrees.  There were several drop offs with no guardrails.  And lots of loose rock covering the roads making it sometimes difficult for my car to get a foothold.  </p><p>With every passing turn, the height of the forest became a little shorter, and more sky started shinning through.  There were more dramatic plateaus, and more dramatic views of the distance I've traveled.</p><p>I stopped a few times to take photos, but after 30 minutes, I reached the end of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444">N36° 11' 27.9", E137° 6' 48.04"</a>.

Next to the marker was a circular monument that labeled all of the surrounding mountains, and also marked the directions of the nearby towns and villages.</p><p>From the peak, you could see almost everything.  To the north, you could see Furukawa <span class='ja'>古川</span>, and a little bit of Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> that isn't obscured by a mountain.  To the east, you could see part of Takayama <span class='ja'>高山</span>, though I could not make out the city hall building.  And to the south, you could see the tollway entrance <span class='ja'>清見</span>IC, which is really the only human structure visible in Kiyomi, besides power line and cellphone towers.</p><p>Here are some panoramic photos:<br/>1.

The whole area seemed so big, and human civilization seemed so small.  So much of Japan is over crowded, but up in the mountains, there's barely anyone.  The mountainous forested wilderness still holds its ground.</p><p>I stayed up here for probably 30 minutes.  The slight dimming of the sky made me worried about having to travel through the difficult mountain road in the dark.</p><p>As I left the peak, some of the clouds on Norikura-dake <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span> began to fade away.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" /></p><p>Also, as I left, I could hear the 5pm curfew chime ringing in Furukawa from all the way up here.</p><p>I got in my car and continued down the mountain road back to the crossroads.  This time the fenced in area actually had roaming cattle!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4943.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4943.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4943.webp" /></p><p>Rather than return to Furukawa, I decided to push forward into the Odori neighborhood of Kiyomi for an ulterior motive.  </p><p>There used to be a branch school of Ikemoto elementary <span class='ja'>池本小</span> in this remote area.  It was named the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span>.  In closed in 1968 after its remaining 2 students graduated or moved or whatever.  Even in 1955, it only had 8 students.  I think <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4955.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4955.webp">this</a> was the site of the old school.</p><p>These days the neighborhood only has one household from what I could tell.  That was the farmhouse you could see from the peak.  This house owned the nearby grazing fields, and several farming fields, too.</p><p>Once I passed a few more fields on the west end of the farming area, the road went into the forest, which was getting darker with the setting sun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" /></p><p>The road was narrow, and winded through the forest following the stream of water trickling down the mountain.  It wasn't very steep, though.  There were several turn-offs from the main road, but were immediately blocked by a gate preventing public access.  I was really afraid that this main road would eventually have the same fate, and force me to turn around.</p><p>The river continued to grow the further down the mountain I went.  What once was a tiny stream, now became a babbling broke, and then a creek.  The road was in better and better condition, too, the further I went, which gave me hope I was approaching the exit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" /></p><p>After one more turn around the side of a mountain, the road widened and straightened.

The exit for this area was near the Ikemoto elementary site, and Kiyomi's zakura tree, directly underneath a bridge for the tollway.</p><p>I drove to the highway entrance, and stopped on the suspended on-ramp to take a photo of where I was only one hour ago, the peak of Ibuseyama, which is somewhat muddled in the amount of mountains.

It stretches over a very wide area, but it's downtown area, is its most prominent feature.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At its height, the entire area of Kamioka housed 30,000 residents.  That was a mere 15 years ago.  Most of its residents worked in the mining facilities throughout the land.  But in 2003, the mines was shut, closed, and were no longer in service.  The workers were fired, or relocated, or whatever..  They left Kamioka for greener pastures.  It's most recent census, in 2004, puts the population of Kamioka at around 10,000.</p><p>When I first visited Kamioka over a year ago, the first thing I noticed was the rail line suspended over part of the town, and going through some of the mountains in town.  It looked rundown, and, upon closer inspection, was no longer in service, and mostly abandoned.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Railway History</b></div><p>According to <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A">Wikipedia</a>, if I'm reading this right..  The current Kamioka Railway was officially opened in 1966, and exclusively shipped freight from the zinc mines in Kamioka.</p><p>In 1984, the mines adopted the world-wide standard for shipping containers, and had to ship freight by truck.  They still used the lines for shipping other things, but to make up for the costs, the railway was now open to the public.  However, every year operated in a hefty loss.</p><p>After 2003, with the loss of the mines, there were significant shortages of freight and passengers.  In 2004, what was left of the mines ceased its freight transports, and then completely cut its use of the railway.  That hefty loss turned into a massive, unjustifiable loss.</p><p>The railway completely ceased operations on December 1st, 2006.  And the bus system made up for the lack of public transportation.</p><p>In 2008, rather than demolish the railway, the city of Kamioka opened the <b>Kamioka Gattan Go!</b> service, which allowed anyone to rent a bicycle contraption, and ride along the last 3km in the rail line within Kamioka proper.  A few months ago, some ALTs and I went for a ride.  You can read that here: <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go" title="/kamioka-gattan-go">May 26th, 2014</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Railway</b></div><p>The Gattan Go service only covers 3km of the 19.9km service.  It starts at the Okuhida Onsen Station <span class='ja'>奥飛騨温泉口駅</span>, and ends at the Kamioka Mining Station <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山前駅</span>, but there is so much more than that.</p><p>This video shows the full 19.9km of the railway when it was still in operation.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI</a></p><p>There are a total of 8 stops including the starting position, and are as follows:</p><p><span class='ja'>猪谷</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>茂住</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>漆山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡大橋</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨温泉</span></p><p>The final four stations, Kamioka Mine, Kamioka, Kamioka Big Bridge, and Okuhida Onsen, are covered in the <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go" title="/kamioka-gattan-go">Gattan Go post</a>.  The rest of the stations are as follows..</p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Mine <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> to Urushiyama <span class='ja'>漆山</span></b></div><p>The Kamioka Mine Station begins our decent to Toyama with 16.9km left to go.

This is a series of 5 tunnels, and they cover almost 5km.  The longest is the Wariishi Tunnel <span class='ja'>割石トンネル</span>, which is 2.6km.</p><p>The Wikipedia mentions that 64% of Kamioka Railway is tunnel, which gave it the nickname, the Okuhida Subway, or <span class='ja'>奥飛騨の地下鉄</span>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4048.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4061.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4061.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4061.webp" /></p><p>This is the other end of the Wariishi Tunnel at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3758278,137.276575" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3758278,137.276575">N36° 22' 32.98", E137° 16' 35.67"</a>.

The tracks are completely grown over from 7 years of neglect.  </p><p>Completing the trip between tunnels, a series of 4 bridges were built, each named Kogen River Bridge <span class='ja'>高原川橋</span>.

An aqua green Kogen River, white washed pink and light orange limestone, deep green pines, and light green fauna.  And if it wasn't the rainy season, there'd be a bright deep blue sky, as well.  The deep orange of the bridge makes it stick out, like man's accomplishment over nature.</p><p>This is the type of scene railway nerds dream of.</p><p>I met an elderly man also admiring the bridge, but he was more interested in looking for fish in the river.  He picked up his stuff, and continued down the path to the river to start his day of fishing.  Maybe I should have joined him for some more shots of the bridge, but I had much more to explore.</p><div class='title'><b>Urushiyama Station <span class='ja'>漆山駅</span></b></div><p>I continued following the length of the railway by driving on Route 41.

There were also several other old buildings that used to be restaurants, and other stores.  So, the Mozumi Station must have had much more through traffic than the Urushiyama Station.</p><p>The building for the Mozumi Station was still standing and intact.  The doors were shut, but unlocked, so I went inside.  The inside of the building seemed pretty well kept.  There were no smell, or anything.  It looked like it might still be in some kind of use.</p><p>I went back outside, and looked around for the staff entrance.  The main door was locked, but the sliding door was off its track and could be removed, so I went inside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4259.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4259.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4259.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4256.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4256.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4256.webp" /></p><p>Inside was the control room for the station.  There was the fuse box for the building, and a gutted ticket machine.  There was also power box for the outside platform, and the control panel for the track switching.  I think the designers took some clear lessons from the original Resident Evil games.  Thank god I was visiting this place in the morning.  I would be totally freaked out if this were dusk, or night.</p><p>In the back, there was a kitchen and sink, which did not look used in the last few years.  The cabinets were completely covered in cobwebs, most of which had spiders attached.  I would've ventured further inside had there not been so many spiders.</p><p>I started snooping around in some of the drawing near the control panel, and inside was a good-sized deep black SNAKE trying to sleep.  I immediately jumped back and the thing started to make some kind of noise.  It was probably saying, "Fuck man, leave me alone.  Let me sleep."  I slowly kicked the drawer shut with my foot.  And then decided that was enough rummaging through drawers.</p><p>In fact, that's enough of this building.  I'm going outside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4297.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4297.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4297.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4320.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4320.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4320.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4323.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4323.webp" /></p><p>This platform was much more overgrown than Urushiyama.  I actually had to use the train platform to get closer to the tunnel.  I could not walk along the tracks due to all the overgrowth.  Again, on the platform, the signs and other identifying things had been removed.</p><p>Man.. Side Note: I really should have looked through the station a little more to try and find a schedule for the Kamioka line.  I found those old phone books, but I really wanted to know what the daily life of this line was like.  I want to know how often it ran, and at what times.  The Wikipedia article gives some hints, but it's not enough.</p><p>Also, I'm really curious on how much it cost to actually ride the Kamioka railway between all these stations.

Maybe because it was so short they decided to leave it open rather than seal it up.  Also nearby was a house or a temple or something, so maybe they wanted to keep it clear because it looked better.</p><div class='title'><b>Hida Nakayama Station <span class='ja'>飛騨中山駅</span></b></div><p>The last decommissioned station on the line was Hida Nakayama Station, with only 2.3km remaining to the end.

It might be the most overgrown of the 3 stations.  With each station, I am getting closer to Toyama, and closer to the Sea of Japan.  I've only traveled 15km, but maybe that's enough to spur such growth in the plant life.</p><div class='title'><b>Hida Nakayama Area</b></div><p>Nakayama was the first area I had been to that had quite a few modern looking, well-kept houses, and actually felt like a neighborhood.

Elderly folks were out on their daily walks.  Several cars were actually driving in the neighborhoods, rather than simply passing by.  For the first time, I came across some actually working vending machines.</p><p>The very last image of the Kamioka Railway, before it plunges into its final tunnel directly on the prefecture line between Gifu and Toyama, was another beautiful red/orange bridge, the Miya River Bridge <span class='ja'>宮川橋</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unlike the 2nd Kogen River Bridge, this was near a dam, and a few other manmade structures.  We were no longer in the remote serene wilderness.

Weirdly enough, the original signs for Hida Nakayama were still placed on the platforms.  This is an unmanned station, so you don't need a ticket to walk around on the platforms.  There aren't any fences or barriers to keep you from walking around, anyway.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4571.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4571.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4571.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4574.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4574.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4588.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4588.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4588.webp" /></p><p>Inotani Station is a checkpoint between the Central Japan Railway Service (JR<span class='ja'>東海</span>), and the Western Japan Railway Service (JR<span class='ja'>西日本</span>), which are separate companies.  Local trains usually stop here, and exchange passengers, and personnel.  Express trains bound from Toyama to Nagoya usually blow through.</p><p>But, despite being a checkpoint station, the place is pretty small.  Trains don't run through here very often either.  The timetable listed less than 10 trains stop here each day.  When I was walking around, there was a train waiting at one of the platforms, but it wasn't scheduled to leave for another 50 minutes.  I met some local workers on their way to that train who must've only been working for half a day.</p><p>Across the street from the station was a very small omiyage shop.  It just looked like a corner store.  The old woman who ran the shop was by the station chatting with a taxi driver who looked equally bored.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>Technically, this is the beginning of the Kamioka Railway, but it's the end of my journey.  The Railway had interested me in quite a while, so it was great to finally see the 19.9km stretch of rail from beginning to end.  There's still some more research I could do, but I think Japanese Wikipedia has much of it covered.  I'm still curious on how frequent the trains ran, the price of the fare.</p><p>Wikipedia mentioned that the Kamioka Railway may have only run 8 times a day.  Which is interesting, because the Takayama Line out of Inotani Station seemed to run just as frequent.  I wonder how much longer the Takayama Line will be cost effective, or if it even is cost effective at the moment.  The bus system covers much more ground at a cheaper price.  And the northern central shinkansen line just completed construction all the way to Kanazawa.  When that line goes all the way to Kyoto and Shin-Osaka, the Takayama line will become even less traveled.</p><p>I always considered Japan a marvel at public transportation, but with the areas in the mountains so wide and remote, it's just not feasible.  If you live out here, you basically need a car.</p><p>Anywyay, urban decay, yeah!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Typhoon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/typhoon">Typhoon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Norikura is one of the tallest mountains in Japan at over 3000 meters.  It's probably the most "magnificent" mountain viewable from Takayama City.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" /></p><p>The Goshikigahara plateau lies within those highborn forests on the west end of the mountain.  Technically, the area should be visible in the above photo.  The forests in this area have never been cut, or disturbed by human hands.  </p><p>In fact, the locals swear that the forests are inhabited by a specie of fairy.  They chat and play in the forest.  Female fairies twinkle like a rainbow.  Male fairies have a silver twinkle.  These fairy are only visible to humans who are pure of heart.  Any person that has caused harm to the environment by littering, or picking or breaking plants will never see them.  Which pretty much rules out everyone on earth.</p><p>If you want to tour Goshikigahara, you must make a reservation, and be accompanied with a guide to show you around.  Tours are about 8500<span class='ja'>円</span> ($85) at the lowest, and generally take about 7 hours.  You need to sign a consent form, too.</p><p>On this particular day, I was quite fortunate to be part of a tour put together by the city of Takayama.  It was only 6000<span class='ja'>円</span>, too. :) This tour was in honor of a very special guest that came to Takayama, Dr. Miya____?  On Saturday, volunteer city officials joined the doctor at the Hida Wisdom Earth Center, and planted a field of trees.  I joined them as part of the city.</p><p>On Sunday, we met with the doctor again as we started our 9 hour trek through the mountainous forest.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Short Course <span class='ja'>ショートコース</span></b></div><p>The tour brought us along the <b>Short Course</b> of Goshikigahara.

We started walking the course around 9:30am.  There was a light rain in the air.  It was nothing heavy or torrential.  It made the wooden walking bridge incredibly slick, though.  Our group continued across it at a very slow pace to make sure no one slipped and hurt themselves.</p><p>We stopped every couple of minutes, and Dr. Miya___? gave a speech explaining the surrounding fauna.  When we reached the actual wasabi plants, he bent down, and pulled up a wasabi plant for all of us to examine.  Each of us, pricked a tiny portion of the plant and ate it.  I could definitely taste a hint of wasabi, but it wasn't nearly as potent as the stuff you'd have at restaurants, or grocery stores.  He gave us another wasabi plant to taste.

Unlike the other 2 falls, the water forming Nunobiki was completely natural, squeezed from the rocks and reservoirs below the surface.  No amount of rain water would ever change the way these falls look.</p><p>This is rather evident when looking at the shape of the falls.  Rather than a concentrated source of water flowing over a cliff, several scattered pockets of water are shot through the cliff face, and flowing down the side.  If this waterfall was formed by a creek, stream or river, a singular focal point would've been carved out of the round over the course of thousands of years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After passing by the falls, I noticed something that was clearly manmade, and not in use for quite a while.  Apparently the early settlers of these lands mined for copper, zinc and iron.  The above structure was carved out of the rock to channel the water from the falls, and generate electricity for the mines.  In this area, watermills were set up to collect the energy and pass it on to the mines.</p><p>I guess, over the years, those watermills were removed to preserve the nature the falls.</p><div class='title'><b>10. Deai Hut <span class='ja'>出合い小屋</span></b></div><p>A few hundred meters away was our final destination of the hike.  We got there around 2:30pm.  Our busses were already waited for us at the Deai Hut.  We went inside, and got a chance to change our clothes again, so we weren't walking around soaking wet.</p><p>We got there well before the women's group, so nearby our guide showed us some funky moss.  Underneath some nearby rocks were moss than reflected any light passing into it.  I'm not sure if my photo really highlights this interesting phenomena, but it was a neat trick.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" /></p><p>Despite being a cold and rainy day, I think the hike was totally worth it.  For the last year and a half, I've lived in the foothills off these mountains, and never saw any of this stuff up close.</p><p>One of the greatest things about living in Takayama is the vast amount of nature that surrounds me everyday.  Well over half the city's area is covered in this wilderness forged from the depths of earth at the basins of several volcanoes.  It's absolutely stunning and beautiful. :)</p><p>Hopefully before I leave Takayama, I'll have a chance to hike the second trail available, which features many more waterfalls.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Oak Village" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/oak-village">Oak Village</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This company was established in 1974 and created almost anything out of wood, from as small as keychains and children's toys, to as large as homes and office buildings.</p><p>The Oak Village stand by 3 principles:</p><p><b>Craftsmanship with a 100-year guarantee</b> <i>"We strive to create products that will last at least as many years as the age of the trees used in those products.  It is our way of paying respect to the forests from which we receive great resources, and in the meanwhile, we can plant and nurture trees to grow new forests."</i></p><p><b>From Bowls to Buildings</b> <i>"Using solid wood (as opposed to plywood or veneer), we use different parts of a given tree for different purposes.  We create a wide range of wooden products, ranging from small articles like accessories and tableware, to larger items like furniture, and we also specialize in wooden architecture.  Through our products we hope to support the needs of a sustainable lifestyle."</i></p><p><b>One Acorn for Every Child</b> <i>"If we take one tree from a forest, we must give one back.  Out of this belief, we created a sister NPO, Donguri no Kai (Acorn Club), which plants and nurtures tree saplings, and maintain healthy forests in various places in Japan.  We hope to create a sustainable cycle of resource usage and renewal."</i></p><p>This year they're celebrating their 40th anniversary.  The Oak Village began with five men working on wood-crafts in a barn.  They continued to make high quality products.  That became their hallmark, and gave them success.  The products they created were born out of the 1000year woodcrafting tradition of Kiyomi with modern advancements of treating woods, and modern styles, as well.  Everything created in the Oak Village is 100% natural, and 100% made from resources of Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Kiyomi Location</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" /></p><p>It's located a few kilometers west of the Takayama Nishi highway exit, and in the middle of the woods they craft and carve into usable and useful items.  Just follow the numerous signs.  The only building open to the public is on your right side.  This building essentially has four areas.  </p><p>When you approach the entrance, on your left, there's a cafe.  They sell plenty of coffee, and some treats.  There's plenty of locally produced Kiyomi goods, too.  On most weekends, they'll provide live music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" /></p><p>On your right is the gift shop.  Here you will find the smallest items crafted at Oak Village.  Some keychains, goblets, eye glass cases, business card cases, picture frames, children's toys, and so forth.</p><p>Most of these things are pretty expensive.  Many of the small items range between 3000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($30) and 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($100).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" /></p><p>Through the gift shop, you can proceed downstairs, and view their larger items.  In the room underneath the gift shop, there are cabinets, tables, and chairs or various sizes.</p><p>Some of the smallest chairs and cabinets cost 4<span class='ja'>万円</span> ($400), but when buying some of the larger sets together, they can cost 40<span class='ja'>万円</span> ($4000).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" /></p><p>Then, finally, past the furniture showroom, you can find the "reform" gallery, and oak village museum.</p><p>On the wall, they show off their best works, which include houses built from scratch.  Models are shown along with photos illustrating their designs and handiwork with the woods they're so comfortable with.  On the opposite side of the room, the show the type of woods used, and their process for building such sturdy and beautiful structures.</p><p>I think you could probably imagine how much any of these kinds of products would cost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Buying Stuff</b></div><p>The reason I came to the Oak Village on this day was to purchase a business card holder for my newly printed cards.  I bought a beautiful cherry finished and lacquered case that cost 7500<span class='ja'>円</span> ($75).  Quite expensive, but it looks really nice. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" /></p><p>In addition, I bought a book, too.  The book contains 15 oak hearts, which are basically wood samples from all the species of tree they use in their products.  You can feel and smell each wood.  It comes with another book that shows a photo of the grown tree, and explains its history and use.</p><p>They gave me some more brochures and catalogues, too, that showcase their most recent furniture creations.  They gave me a copy of their quarterly magazine, too, which features articles of their past and current architectural plans.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at their website: <a href="http://oakv.co.jp/" title="http://oakv.co.jp/">http://oakv.co.jp/</a>.  Anything available at their Kiyomi location, is available online, too.  I don't know about shipping though.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Car Wash Graveyard" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/carwash-graveyard">Car Wash Graveyard</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I was looking for some areas marked on a mark that apparently no longer existed.

It was so weird to see so many of these things organized in one place.  Especially since there are only 2 gas stations in all of Kiyomi.</p><p class='img'><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9084_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9084_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9084_stitch.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9098.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9098.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9098.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9102.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9102.webp" /></p><p>I was about to get a closer look at some of the machinery when I noticed a fairly large spider nestled in the cloth of the scrubbing unit thing.</p><p>Anyway, I thought this was a rather weird thing to come across.  I guess the actual junk yard didn't have any room, or some gas station chain in another village needed extra space to dump their used car washes.
