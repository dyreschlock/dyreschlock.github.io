| September 3, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On the border between Takayama City, and Hida City, between Kiyomi Village and Furukawa Town, there lies a mountain named Ibuseyama <span class='ja'>猪臥山</span>.  The website said it was famous, but when I mentioned it to a few local teachers, none of them had heard of it.  The peak of Ibuseyama is about an hours drive from Furukawa, so I decided to take a look.</p><p>Out of Furukawa, there's a road named Hwy 90, and it acts as a shortcut for people in western Hida City to reach the tollway entrance in Kiyomi, named the Hida Kiyomi IC <span class='ja'>飛騨清見</span>IC.  The road starts off rather large and straight, but there are pockets of houses that do not allow the road to continue this way.  The road windily climbs up the side of a mountain and through a forest.  At its peak, the road levels off, widens, and continues straight once again.  After the road widens, it goes through a near 4.5km long tunnel, and then you're nearly at the tollway entrance.</p><p>To get to Ibuseyama, you need to turn into a neighborhood right before this tunnel.  This one: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2206806,137.1501111">N36° 13' 14.45", E137° 9' 0.4"</a>.  In fact, this very turn can be seen from the peak of Ibuseyama.  The road becomes very narrow, and the forest becomes thicker, and more debris is scattered on the road since very few people actually go this way.</p><p>After 20 minutes from Furukawa, you reach a very remote area of Kiyomi Village <span class='ja'>清見村</span>, the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'>小鳥町</span>.  Here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.2062278,137.1055222">N36° 12' 22.42", E137° 6' 19.88"</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4611.webp" /></p><p>There's a crossroads here.  I stopped my car, and got out to take this photo.  After standing, there was absolutely no sound.  No running water.  No wind.  No animals.  Nothing.  It was dead silent.  Once crossed into this remote area of Kiyomi, it was like I entered a dead zone.  Maybe it was haunted.</p><p>Anyway, at this crossroads, I had two choices. Make a left and continue to the mountain, or continue straight through the Odori neighborhood <span class='ja'>小鳥町</span> of Kiyomi. I went left.</p><p>The road is paved, which is nice, but much of the pavement is cracked and bulging from the movement of rock underneath, erosion by water and melted snow on the top, or landslides that had previously taken out part of the road.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4939.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4924.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4674_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>My little car continued to climb.  I went past several hairpin turns exceeding 180 degrees.  There were several drop offs with no guardrails.  And lots of loose rock covering the roads making it sometimes difficult for my car to get a foothold.  </p><p>With every passing turn, the height of the forest became a little shorter, and more sky started shinning through.  There were more dramatic plateaus, and more dramatic views of the distance I've traveled.</p><p>I stopped a few times to take photos, but after 30 minutes, I reached the end of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4683_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4695_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was here: <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.1910833,137.1133444">N36° 11' 27.9", E137° 6' 48.04"</a>. I made it, and parked my car.  Nearby was a bathroom that was not regularly serviced.  I could see all the distance I had traveled up to that point, but there was still more to go to actually reach the peak.</p><p>I climbed the stairs, and was met by heaven's gate.  Continuing along, I met the god of the mountain <span class='ja'>山之神</span>.

Next to the marker was a circular monument that labeled all of the surrounding mountains, and also marked the directions of the nearby towns and villages.</p><p>From the peak, you could see almost everything.  To the north, you could see Furukawa <span class='ja'>古川</span>, and a little bit of Kokufu <span class='ja'>国府</span> that isn't obscured by a mountain.  To the east, you could see part of Takayama <span class='ja'>高山</span>, though I could not make out the city hall building.  And to the south, you could see the tollway entrance <span class='ja'>清見</span>IC, which is really the only human structure visible in Kiyomi, besides power line and cellphone towers.</p><p>Here are some panoramic photos:<br/>1. A close-up of Furukawa <span class='ja'>古川</span>.<br/>2. A close-up of Kiyomi <span class='ja'>清見</span>.<br/>3.

The whole area seemed so big, and human civilization seemed so small.  So much of Japan is over crowded, but up in the mountains, there's barely anyone.  The mountainous forested wilderness still holds its ground.</p><p>I stayed up here for probably 30 minutes.  The slight dimming of the sky made me worried about having to travel through the difficult mountain road in the dark.</p><p>As I left the peak, some of the clouds on Norikura-dake <span class='ja'>乗鞍岳</span> began to fade away.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4894.webp" /></p><p>Also, as I left, I could hear the 5pm curfew chime ringing in Furukawa from all the way up here.</p><p>I got in my car and continued down the mountain road back to the crossroads.  This time the fenced in area actually had roaming cattle!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4943.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4943.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4943.webp" /></p><p>Rather than return to Furukawa, I decided to push forward into the Odori neighborhood of Kiyomi for an ulterior motive.  </p><p>There used to be a branch school of Ikemoto elementary <span class='ja'>池本小</span> in this remote area.  It was named the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span>.  In closed in 1968 after its remaining 2 students graduated or moved or whatever.  Even in 1955, it only had 8 students.

That was the farmhouse you could see from the peak.  This house owned the nearby grazing fields, and several farming fields, too.</p><p>Once I passed a few more fields on the west end of the farming area, the road went into the forest, which was getting darker with the setting sun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4962.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_4965.webp" /></p><p>The road was narrow, and winded through the forest following the stream of water trickling down the mountain.  It wasn't very steep, though.  There were several turn-offs from the main road, but were immediately blocked by a gate preventing public access.  I was really afraid that this main road would eventually have the same fate, and force me to turn around.</p><p>The river continued to grow the further down the mountain I went.  What once was a tiny stream, now became a babbling broke, and then a creek.  The road was in better and better condition, too, the further I went, which gave me hope I was approaching the exit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5015.webp" /></p><p>After one more turn around the side of a mountain, the road widened and straightened.  I was able to drive nearly 60mph again, rather than the careful cautious 10mph or 15mph I had been driving up until now.</p><p>I passed huge quarries, and construction workers tearing up part of the mountain.</p><p>Then I finally reached the exit at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.198875,137.0415361" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.198875,137.0415361">N36° 11' 55.95", E137° 2' 29.53"</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5022.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5022.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5022.webp" /></p><p>I was back on the main road in the Ikemoto neighborhood <span class='ja'>池本町</span> of Kiyomi.  I had traveled nearly 45 minutes to get to this point from the peak, and now there's only another 10 minutes to get to the highway, and being able to speed back to Takayama.  The exit for this area was near the Ikemoto elementary site, and Kiyomi's zakura tree, directly underneath a bridge for the tollway.</p><p>I drove to the highway entrance, and stopped on the suspended on-ramp to take a photo of where I was only one hour ago, the peak of Ibuseyama, which is somewhat muddled in the amount of mountains.  It's near that cellphone tower on the left side of the photo.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140902_ibuseyama/IMG_5030_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is just one of many mountains in the Hida Takayama area, and perhaps the easiest and cheapest one to climb.  I have a list and maps of 12 other hiking trails to the peaks of mountains in Hida city.  </p><p>Now isn't the best time to climb due to the rain, and cloud cover, but as it gets colder, and fall approaches, the skies will become clear, and the scenery will look even more beautiful.

It stretches over a very wide area, but it's downtown area, is its most prominent feature.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_3982_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At its height, the entire area of Kamioka housed 30,000 residents.  That was a mere 15 years ago.  Most of its residents worked in the mining facilities throughout the land.  But in 2003, the mines was shut, closed, and were no longer in service.  The workers were fired, or relocated, or whatever..  They left Kamioka for greener pastures.  It's most recent census, in 2004, puts the population of Kamioka at around 10,000.</p><p>When I first visited Kamioka over a year ago, the first thing I noticed was the rail line suspended over part of the town, and going through some of the mountains in town.  It looked rundown, and, upon closer inspection, was no longer in service, and mostly abandoned.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4029_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Railway History</b></div><p>According to <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A" title="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E9%89%84%E9%81%93%E7%A5%9E%E5%B2%A1%E7%B7%9A">Wikipedia</a>, if I'm reading this right..  The current Kamioka Railway was officially opened in 1966, and exclusively shipped freight from the zinc mines in Kamioka.</p><p>In 1984, the mines adopted the world-wide standard for shipping containers, and had to ship freight by truck.  They still used the lines for shipping other things, but to make up for the costs, the railway was now open to the public.  However, every year operated in a hefty loss.</p><p>After 2003, with the loss of the mines, there were significant shortages of freight and passengers.  In 2004, what was left of the mines ceased its freight transports, and then completely cut its use of the railway.  That hefty loss turned into a massive, unjustifiable loss.</p><p>The railway completely ceased operations on December 1st, 2006.  And the bus system made up for the lack of public transportation.</p><p>In 2008, rather than demolish the railway, the city of Kamioka opened the <b>Kamioka Gattan Go!</b> service, which allowed anyone to rent a bicycle contraption, and ride along the last 3km in the rail line within Kamioka proper.  A few months ago, some ALTs and I went for a ride.  You can read that here: <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go" title="/kamioka-gattan-go">May 26th, 2014</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Railway</b></div><p>The Gattan Go service only covers 3km of the 19.9km service.  It starts at the Okuhida Onsen Station <span class='ja'>奥飛騨温泉口駅</span>, and ends at the Kamioka Mining Station <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山前駅</span>, but there is so much more than that.</p><p>This video shows the full 19.9km of the railway when it was still in operation.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI</a></p><p>There are a total of 8 stops including the starting position, and are as follows:</p><p><span class='ja'>猪谷</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>茂住</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>漆山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡大橋</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨温泉</span></p><p>The final four stations, Kamioka Mine, Kamioka, Kamioka Big Bridge, and Okuhida Onsen, are covered in the <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go" title="/kamioka-gattan-go">Gattan Go post</a>.  The rest of the stations are as follows..</p><div class='title'><b>Kamioka Mine <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> to Urushiyama <span class='ja'>漆山</span></b></div><p>The Kamioka Mine Station begins our decent to Toyama with 16.9km left to go.

This is a series of 5 tunnels, and they cover almost 5km.  The longest is the Wariishi Tunnel <span class='ja'>割石トンネル</span>, which is 2.6km.</p><p>The Wikipedia mentions that 64% of Kamioka Railway is tunnel, which gave it the nickname, the Okuhida Subway, or <span class='ja'>奥飛騨の地下鉄</span>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4048.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4061.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4061.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4061.webp" /></p><p>This is the other end of the Wariishi Tunnel at <a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3758278,137.276575" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.3758278,137.276575">N36° 22' 32.98", E137° 16' 35.67"</a>.

An aqua green Kogen River, white washed pink and light orange limestone, deep green pines, and light green fauna.  And if it wasn't the rainy season, there'd be a bright deep blue sky, as well.  The deep orange of the bridge makes it stick out, like man's accomplishment over nature.</p><p>This is the type of scene railway nerds dream of.</p><p>I met an elderly man also admiring the bridge, but he was more interested in looking for fish in the river.  He picked up his stuff, and continued down the path to the river to start his day of fishing.

There were also several other old buildings that used to be restaurants, and other stores.  So, the Mozumi Station must have had much more through traffic than the Urushiyama Station.</p><p>The building for the Mozumi Station was still standing and intact.  The doors were shut, but unlocked, so I went inside.  The inside of the building seemed pretty well kept.  There were no smell, or anything.  It looked like it might still be in some kind of use.</p><p>I went back outside, and looked around for the staff entrance.  The main door was locked, but the sliding door was off its track and could be removed, so I went inside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4259.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4259.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4259.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4256.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4256.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4256.webp" /></p><p>Inside was the control room for the station.  There was the fuse box for the building, and a gutted ticket machine.  There was also power box for the outside platform, and the control panel for the track switching.  I think the designers took some clear lessons from the original Resident Evil games.  Thank god I was visiting this place in the morning.  I would be totally freaked out if this were dusk, or night.</p><p>In the back, there was a kitchen and sink, which did not look used in the last few years.  The cabinets were completely covered in cobwebs, most of which had spiders attached.  I would've ventured further inside had there not been so many spiders.</p><p>I started snooping around in some of the drawing near the control panel, and inside was a good-sized deep black SNAKE trying to sleep.  I immediately jumped back and the thing started to make some kind of noise.  It was probably saying, "Fuck man, leave me alone.  Let me sleep."  I slowly kicked the drawer shut with my foot.  And then decided that was enough rummaging through drawers.</p><p>In fact, that's enough of this building.  I'm going outside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4297.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4297.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4297.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4320.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4320.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4320.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4323.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4323.webp" /></p><p>This platform was much more overgrown than Urushiyama.  I actually had to use the train platform to get closer to the tunnel.  I could not walk along the tracks due to all the overgrowth.  Again, on the platform, the signs and other identifying things had been removed.</p><p>Man.. Side Note: I really should have looked through the station a little more to try and find a schedule for the Kamioka line.  I found those old phone books, but I really wanted to know what the daily life of this line was like.  I want to know how often it ran, and at what times.  The Wikipedia article gives some hints, but it's not enough.</p><p>Also, I'm really curious on how much it cost to actually ride the Kamioka railway between all these stations.  I really should have looked at that ticket machine closer.</p><p>Anyway, there were plenty of spiders outside, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4339.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4372.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4372.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4372.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4376.webp" /></p><p>Down the line a few hundred meters was an open tunnel.

It might be the most overgrown of the 3 stations.  With each station, I am getting closer to Toyama, and closer to the Sea of Japan.  I've only traveled 15km, but maybe that's enough to spur such growth in the plant life.</p><div class='title'><b>Hida Nakayama Area</b></div><p>Nakayama was the first area I had been to that had quite a few modern looking, well-kept houses, and actually felt like a neighborhood.

Elderly folks were out on their daily walks.  Several cars were actually driving in the neighborhoods, rather than simply passing by.  For the first time, I came across some actually working vending machines.</p><p>The very last image of the Kamioka Railway, before it plunges into its final tunnel directly on the prefecture line between Gifu and Toyama, was another beautiful red/orange bridge, the Miya River Bridge <span class='ja'>宮川橋</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140901_kamioka_line/IMG_4552_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unlike the 2nd Kogen River Bridge, this was near a dam, and a few other manmade structures.

Local trains usually stop here, and exchange passengers, and personnel.  Express trains bound from Toyama to Nagoya usually blow through.</p><p>But, despite being a checkpoint station, the place is pretty small.  Trains don't run through here very often either.  The timetable listed less than 10 trains stop here each day.  When I was walking around, there was a train waiting at one of the platforms, but it wasn't scheduled to leave for another 50 minutes.  I met some local workers on their way to that train who must've only been working for half a day.</p><p>Across the street from the station was a very small omiyage shop.  It just looked like a corner store.  The old woman who ran the shop was by the station chatting with a taxi driver who looked equally bored.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>Technically, this is the beginning of the Kamioka Railway, but it's the end of my journey.  The Railway had interested me in quite a while, so it was great to finally see the 19.9km stretch of rail from beginning to end.  There's still some more research I could do, but I think Japanese Wikipedia has much of it covered.  I'm still curious on how frequent the trains ran, the price of the fare.</p><p>Wikipedia mentioned that the Kamioka Railway may have only run 8 times a day.  Which is interesting, because the Takayama Line out of Inotani Station seemed to run just as frequent.  I wonder how much longer the Takayama Line will be cost effective, or if it even is cost effective at the moment.  The bus system covers much more ground at a cheaper price.  And the northern central shinkansen line just completed construction all the way to Kanazawa.  When that line goes all the way to Kyoto and Shin-Osaka, the Takayama line will become even less traveled.</p><p>I always considered Japan a marvel at public transportation, but with the areas in the mountains so wide and remote, it's just not feasible.  If you live out here, you basically need a car.</p><p>Anywyay, urban decay, yeah!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Typhoon" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/typhoon">Typhoon</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Technically, the area should be visible in the above photo.  The forests in this area have never been cut, or disturbed by human hands.  </p><p>In fact, the locals swear that the forests are inhabited by a specie of fairy.  They chat and play in the forest.  Female fairies twinkle like a rainbow.  Male fairies have a silver twinkle.  These fairy are only visible to humans who are pure of heart.  Any person that has caused harm to the environment by littering, or picking or breaking plants will never see them.  Which pretty much rules out everyone on earth.</p><p>If you want to tour Goshikigahara, you must make a reservation, and be accompanied with a guide to show you around.  Tours are about 8500<span class='ja'>円</span> ($85) at the lowest, and generally take about 7 hours.  You need to sign a consent form, too.</p><p>On this particular day, I was quite fortunate to be part of a tour put together by the city of Takayama.  It was only 6000<span class='ja'>円</span>, too. :) This tour was in honor of a very special guest that came to Takayama, Dr. Miya____?

We started walking the course around 9:30am.  There was a light rain in the air.  It was nothing heavy or torrential.  It made the wooden walking bridge incredibly slick, though.  Our group continued across it at a very slow pace to make sure no one slipped and hurt themselves.</p><p>We stopped every couple of minutes, and Dr. Miya___? gave a speech explaining the surrounding fauna.  When we reached the actual wasabi plants, he bent down, and pulled up a wasabi plant for all of us to examine.  Each of us, pricked a tiny portion of the plant and ate it.  I could definitely taste a hint of wasabi, but it wasn't nearly as potent as the stuff you'd have at restaurants, or grocery stores.  He gave us another wasabi plant to taste.  This time, I tried part of the stem, and that definitely held the potent spicy flavor I was used to.</p><p>We continued through the light rain, and Miya___? continued to give light explanations of the environment around us.</p><p>After about 40 minutes, we reached the road once again and met with the Snake Dashidani Bridge <span class='ja'>蛇出谷橋</span> (<span class='ja'>じゃだしだに</span>).  And right next to the bridge, was the first waypoint, and the beginning of the Short Course.</p><div class='title'><b>1.

We rested for a little bit, but the mosquitoes in the area were terrible.  Constantly buzzing into your face, eyes, nose, and ears.  The guides put together their bug repellent contraptions.  Other people starting putting our their bug spray.</p><p>Dr. Miya___? continued to talk about the surrounding fauna.  In the above picture, he mentioned that the plants under our feet are incredibly resilient.  They can be stepped on, or driven over, but they are unharmed and continue to grow.  </p><p>The plants behind him are grass and weeds that have grown without the intervention of mankind.  Without anyone cutting them, or taking care of them, nature can grow completely out of hand on its own.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Iwanami Hut was the end of the journey for the doctor.  He was not able to travel with us for the entirety of the hike today.  But, it was great to be able to meet him, and partially understand some of the wisdom he attempted to impart on me.</p><p>At this point, our big group split into 2.  The men formed the first group, and the women formed a group behind us.  There were 6 of us, including the guide.  We left to begin the Short Course around 10:30am.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" /></p><p>The road continued into the woods.  Much like Miya___?, our guide pointed out many of the interesting plants.  The above plants were described at trumpets by the local people who first came to the mountain thousands of years ago.  Several creeks, and water flows ran underneath the road carrying the rain water the pounded us earlier.</p><p>But, our path was basically just a road.  There was enough room for any automobile to drive up here, so it didn't really feel like some mountainous path.  It just felt like a service road.</p><p>20 minutes after we began the Short Course, we reached our first waypoint.</p><div class='title'><b>2.

This path was about 1.3 kilometers long, and took us down 150 meters in sea level.</p><p>We stopped several times as our guide explained what we were seeing in the forest.</p><p>He talked about the mushrooms and other fungus of the forest.  They are basically the "cleaners" of the forest.  Any dying or decaying matter in the forest is eaten by the fungus, and recycled back into nutrients for the living creatures of the forest.  The eat away disease and rot, and keep everything clean.</p><p>Additionally, as shown in the photo below, many of the trees have slight bulges in their trunks.

All the water we had met through our journey down the mountain feel down these 20 or 30 meters in the pools below.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>9. Nunobiki Falls <span class='ja'>布引滝</span></b></div><p>Next we met the actual treasure of this hiking trail, the Nunobiki Falls, which were directly next to the Yokote and Sakura-kon waterfalls.  Unlike the other 2 falls, the water forming Nunobiki was completely natural, squeezed from the rocks and reservoirs below the surface.  No amount of rain water would ever change the way these falls look.</p><p>This is rather evident when looking at the shape of the falls.  Rather than a concentrated source of water flowing over a cliff, several scattered pockets of water are shot through the cliff face, and flowing down the side.  If this waterfall was formed by a creek, stream or river, a singular focal point would've been carved out of the round over the course of thousands of years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After passing by the falls, I noticed something that was clearly manmade, and not in use for quite a while.  Apparently the early settlers of these lands mined for copper, zinc and iron.  The above structure was carved out of the rock to channel the water from the falls, and generate electricity for the mines.  In this area, watermills were set up to collect the energy and pass it on to the mines.</p><p>I guess, over the years, those watermills were removed to preserve the nature the falls.</p><div class='title'><b>10. Deai Hut <span class='ja'>出合い小屋</span></b></div><p>A few hundred meters away was our final destination of the hike.  We got there around 2:30pm.  Our busses were already waited for us at the Deai Hut.  We went inside, and got a chance to change our clothes again, so we weren't walking around soaking wet.</p><p>We got there well before the women's group, so nearby our guide showed us some funky moss.  Underneath some nearby rocks were moss than reflected any light passing into it.  I'm not sure if my photo really highlights this interesting phenomena, but it was a neat trick.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" /></p><p>Despite being a cold and rainy day, I think the hike was totally worth it.  For the last year and a half, I've lived in the foothills off these mountains, and never saw any of this stuff up close.</p><p>One of the greatest things about living in Takayama is the vast amount of nature that surrounds me everyday.  Well over half the city's area is covered in this wilderness forged from the depths of earth at the basins of several volcanoes.  It's absolutely stunning and beautiful. :)</p><p>Hopefully before I leave Takayama, I'll have a chance to hike the second trail available, which features many more waterfalls.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Oak Village" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/oak-village">Oak Village</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This company was established in 1974 and created almost anything out of wood, from as small as keychains and children's toys, to as large as homes and office buildings.</p><p>The Oak Village stand by 3 principles:</p><p><b>Craftsmanship with a 100-year guarantee</b> <i>"We strive to create products that will last at least as many years as the age of the trees used in those products.  It is our way of paying respect to the forests from which we receive great resources, and in the meanwhile, we can plant and nurture trees to grow new forests."</i></p><p><b>From Bowls to Buildings</b> <i>"Using solid wood (as opposed to plywood or veneer), we use different parts of a given tree for different purposes.  We create a wide range of wooden products, ranging from small articles like accessories and tableware, to larger items like furniture, and we also specialize in wooden architecture.  Through our products we hope to support the needs of a sustainable lifestyle."</i></p><p><b>One Acorn for Every Child</b> <i>"If we take one tree from a forest, we must give one back.  Out of this belief, we created a sister NPO, Donguri no Kai (Acorn Club), which plants and nurtures tree saplings, and maintain healthy forests in various places in Japan.  We hope to create a sustainable cycle of resource usage and renewal."</i></p><p>This year they're celebrating their 40th anniversary.  The Oak Village began with five men working on wood-crafts in a barn.  They continued to make high quality products.  That became their hallmark, and gave them success.  The products they created were born out of the 1000year woodcrafting tradition of Kiyomi with modern advancements of treating woods, and modern styles, as well.  Everything created in the Oak Village is 100% natural, and 100% made from resources of Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Kiyomi Location</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" /></p><p>It's located a few kilometers west of the Takayama Nishi highway exit, and in the middle of the woods they craft and carve into usable and useful items.  Just follow the numerous signs.  The only building open to the public is on your right side.  This building essentially has four areas.  </p><p>When you approach the entrance, on your left, there's a cafe.  They sell plenty of coffee, and some treats.  There's plenty of locally produced Kiyomi goods, too.  On most weekends, they'll provide live music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" /></p><p>On your right is the gift shop.  Here you will find the smallest items crafted at Oak Village.  Some keychains, goblets, eye glass cases, business card cases, picture frames, children's toys, and so forth.</p><p>Most of these things are pretty expensive.  Many of the small items range between 3000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($30) and 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($100).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" /></p><p>Through the gift shop, you can proceed downstairs, and view their larger items.  In the room underneath the gift shop, there are cabinets, tables, and chairs or various sizes.</p><p>Some of the smallest chairs and cabinets cost 4<span class='ja'>万円</span> ($400), but when buying some of the larger sets together, they can cost 40<span class='ja'>万円</span> ($4000).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" /></p><p>Then, finally, past the furniture showroom, you can find the "reform" gallery, and oak village museum.</p><p>On the wall, they show off their best works, which include houses built from scratch.  Models are shown along with photos illustrating their designs and handiwork with the woods they're so comfortable with.  On the opposite side of the room, the show the type of woods used, and their process for building such sturdy and beautiful structures.</p><p>I think you could probably imagine how much any of these kinds of products would cost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Buying Stuff</b></div><p>The reason I came to the Oak Village on this day was to purchase a business card holder for my newly printed cards.  I bought a beautiful cherry finished and lacquered case that cost 7500<span class='ja'>円</span> ($75).  Quite expensive, but it looks really nice. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" /></p><p>In addition, I bought a book, too.  The book contains 15 oak hearts, which are basically wood samples from all the species of tree they use in their products.  You can feel and smell each wood.  It comes with another book that shows a photo of the grown tree, and explains its history and use.</p><p>They gave me some more brochures and catalogues, too, that showcase their most recent furniture creations.  They gave me a copy of their quarterly magazine, too, which features articles of their past and current architectural plans.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at their website: <a href="http://oakv.co.jp/" title="http://oakv.co.jp/">http://oakv.co.jp/</a>.  Anything available at their Kiyomi location, is available online, too.  I don't know about shipping though.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Car Wash Graveyard" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/carwash-graveyard">Car Wash Graveyard</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Today, Kiyomi has 1 junior high school, and 1 elementary, but it used to have a whole lot more.</p><p>Last year, Kiyomi Junior High School celebrated its 50th year.  And this year, Kiyomi Elementary celebrates its 40th.  When both schools were opened, it was the consolidation of all the education in Kiyomi into a single building.</p><p>Back when I first started at Kiyomi, I spent a few days in the Library, and looked through books in their "local" section.  I found a book published by the City Council of Kiyomi that was basically the almanac of the village.  It details Kiyomi's agriculture, industry, demographics, and history.  There was a section of the book titled <span class='ja'>わたしの学校</span> (or "My School") which I found quite fascinated.  It had a timeline of all the schools that ever existed in Kiyomi village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, I present to you: The History of Kiyomi Schools.</p><p><i>Much of the general historical information was taken from Wikipedia.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Meiji Period</b></div><p>The earliest schools in Kiyomi date all the way back near the beginning of the Meiji period.  <span class='ja'>明治</span>6, 7, and 8 marked the beginning of Kiyomi's 6 major schools.  That's 1873, 1874, and 1875.</p><p>The Meiji period marked the beginning of Japan's restoration to bring themselves out of their feudal society and into the modern world that was way more advanced than they were.  Education was one of the biggest concerns in the country.  In 1871, the Ministry of Education was established with a school system closely based on the United States.  They created elementary, middle, normal, and university school systems.</p><p>Elementary schools taught primary education are were meant to create loyal subjects to the Emperor of Japan.  Middle schools were secondary education, and were basically the equivalent of a High School.  They were to prepare students to enter Universities, and the Universities were to create students into leaders and modernize Japan.  Normal schools were training schools for graduates of middle schools who wanted to become teachers. </p><p>By 1900, Enrollment in public schools was 90%, whereas the start of the Meiji era only had 50%.<br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>At this time, the 6 schools in Kiyomi were:</p><p><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>まきがほら</span> / Makigahora<br/><span class='ja'>福奇尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>ふくより</span> / Fukuyori<br/><span class='ja'>巣野俣尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>すのまた</span> / Sunomata<br/><span class='ja'>夏厩尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>なつうまや</span> / Natsuumaya<br/><span class='ja'>池本尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>いけもと</span> / Ikemoto<br/><span class='ja'>大原尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>おっぱら</span> / Oppara</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>Kiyomi had 2 branch schools, too:</p><p><span class='ja'>森茂分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>もりも</span> / Morimo<br/><span class='ja'>楢谷分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>ならだに</span> / Naradani</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Each school (and branch school) is named after the neighborhood it resides it.</p><p>The official declaration of a school was <span class='ja'>尋常小学校</span>.  <span class='ja'>尋常</span> or <span class='ja'>じんじょう</span> translates as public, or common.  <span class='ja'>小学校</span> (<span class='ja'>しょうがっこ</span>) is elementary school.  Branch schools were <span class='ja'>分教場</span> (<span class='ja'>ぶんきょうじょう</span>).</p><p>Higher education became increasingly important as Japan continued to industrialize.  In 1904, in Kiyomi, Makigahora, Fukuyori, and Natsuumaya all changed their designation to <span class='ja'>尋常高等小学校</span> adding the <span class='ja'>高等</span> into their names.  <span class='ja'>高等</span>, or <span class='ja'>こうとう</span>, stands for "high class."  It's also the same word used for Senior High School <span class='ja'>高等学校</span>.</p><p>In 1907, elementary school attendance was made mandatory.  From now on, all children in Japan were required to have 6 years of primary education.  Middle schools were only required for students who wanted to go to a university, or normal school.</p><div class='title'><b>Taisho Period</b></div><p>In 1912, Emperor Meiji passed away, and Taisho became the new emperor.  The educational system became even more centralized, but there were plenty of good things that happened.  The Extraordinary Council on Education was created in 1917 and set forth many reforms.  Many more private colleges were now officially recognized.  Subsidies were introduced for poor families so their children could attend schools.</p><p>Education started to become much more militaristic, too.  And Japan started using a lot of educational ideas from Germany to instill the ideas of nationalism, patriotism, and militarization.</p><div class='title'><b>Showa Period</b></div><p>Nationalism and Militarization continued as Japan entered World War II.  In 1941, the educational system renamed all of its schools to <span class='ja'>国民学校</span> (<span class='ja'>こくみんがっこ</span>), which means National People's Schools.  This is taken from the German language.  Nation People's School translates as Volksschule, which is interesting, too.  Schule is School in German.  Volks stands for "people of", "national", etc.  The name Volkswagen makes a lot of sense now.</p><p>The elementary schools now required mandatory military training.  The principles of education now taught traditional, political, religious, and moral values.  Every day was to serve the Empire of Japan.  Every school in Japan turned into a cult of worship building loyal soldiers to die for their country.</p><div class='title'><b>Post-War</b></div><p>In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, and the educational system of Japan had collapsed.  As the United States occupied Japan and rebuilt it, there were several specific missions sent to rebuild the educational system.</p><p>One of these new reforms was to recreate the division between the levels of schooling to resemble the US.</p><p>Before now, elementary education was 6 years, secondary education was 3 years, and higher education (university) was 4 years.  Only elementary schools were mandatory.  The reforms now created two tiers of secondary education: lower and upper, and made lower secondary education mandatory for all students.</p><p>This created the following:</p><p><span class='ja'>小学校</span> - Elementary Schools - Elementary education for 6 years.

Combining the attendance at each school, there were 373 junior high school students, and 750 elementary students in that year.</p><p>The population of Kiyomi was decreasing, and the world was getting smaller with advancements in automobiles, and other forms of travel.</p><p>With the junior high school system in place, all schools across Japan began making separate buildings for junior high students only.  In 1962, construction began for a single building in all of Kiyomi that would unite the junior high students under one roof.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> / Kiyomi Junior High School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" /></p><p>In <span class='ja'>昭和</span>38, or 1963, Kiyomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> opened for its first school year, and all the junior high school students in Kiyomi village now attended this school.  Both Morimo Branch School <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>, and Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> still served some junior high students, but only in the winter when traveling to Kiyomi JHS was too difficult.  For Junior High, both schools operat as branch schools of Kiyomi JHS, whereas for elementary, they operated as branch schools of the nearby elementaries.</p><p>Also, Kiyomi JHS had an attached dormitory.  During the winter months, and throughout the year, students would be able to live at the school rather than make the journey home.</p><p>In its first year, the graduating class of Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> was 126 students, which were split between 3 classes at school.  The Junior High had an attached dormitory, so students from the distant areas of Kiyomi lived at school for the whole week before returning home for the weekend.</p><p>I think it became a real point of pride for Kiyomi when the junior high school opened.  For the first time in its history, all the village's students attended the same school, and had classes together.  It really brought everyone together, and became a symbol for the community of Kiyomi.</p><div class='title'><b>Consolidation</b></div><p>A few years after Kiyomi JHS opened, the lingering branch schools began closing and filtering their students into the junior high school, and existing official nearby elementary schools.  Though, this was also more likely because the more remote regions of Kiyomi were no longer self-sustaining, and people were moving into the more populated areas.</p><p>The Sunomata ES <span class='ja'>巣野俣小</span> building closed in 1965, and all their students now went to Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span>.  And with the closure of Sunomata, the Naradani Branch School <span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span> closed, too.  Any students in Naradani probably just went to Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span>.</p><p>The Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> changed it's name to Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>冬期分校</span> in 1965.  <span class='ja'>冬期</span> or <span class='ja'>とうき</span> is Japanese for Winter Term, so I'm guessing this school was only used in the winter to relieve the students of the dangerous daily journey to school.  It stayed open for another 3 years, and closed for good in 1968.</p><p>Also, in 1968, the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span> of Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span> closed.</p><p>Kiyomi now had 5 operating elementary schools, and one distant branch school (Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>).  Until…</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> / Kiyomi Elementary School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" /></p><p>In 1974, or <span class='ja'>昭和</span>49, as the population of Kiyomi continued to decrease by the younger generation moving away to more prosperous areas of Takayama, construction of Kiyomi Elementary School <span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> was complete.  Makigahora ES <span class='ja'>牧ケ洞小</span>, Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span> both closed and their students now attended Kiyomi ES.  Natsuumaya ES <span class='ja'>夏厩小</span> closed as well, and those students filtered into Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>.</p><p>The two most distant schools, Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span> and Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>, continued to operate after Kiyomi ES was open.</p><p>The Morimo Branch <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span> finally closed, too, on the eve of Kiyomi ES's opening.  I think the final remaining residents of that neighborhood finally moved closer in Kiyomi, or another neighboring area.  Which left Morimo completely uninhabited.</p><p>10 years later, in 1984, Ikemoto ES closed its doors, and its students went to Kiyomi ES.  And then, finally, in 2003, Opara ES closed, too.  </p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>And that brings us to today.  Since then, Kiyomi village has only two schools, Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> and Kiyomi ES <span class='ja'>清見小</span>.  Both of which all students in Kiyomi attend.</p><p>It's really hard to believe that Kiyomi JHS could actually hold 126 students in each class.  Today, each class has 23 to 27 students.  The population decline in Japan is very real, and it's very apparent when you start viewing the historical records in the schools.  Each year, graduating classes get a little bit smaller, and a little bit smaller.  Then those schools are closed, and students are filtered into the larger nearby schools.</p><p>At Kiyomi elementary, there are photos of the 10 schools mentioned above in the main entrance of the school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From top to bottom, left to right, we have:</p><p>Ikemoto <span class='ja'>池本</span>, Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, Odori Mountain <span class='ja'>小鳥山</span>, Natsuumaya <span class='ja'>夏厩</span>, Kami Odori <span class='ja'>上小鳥</span><br/>Makigahora <span class='ja'>牧ケ洞</span>, Fukuyori <span class='ja'>福寄</span>, Sunomata <span class='ja'>巣野俣</span>, Oppara <span class='ja'>大原</span>, Naradani <span class='ja'>楢谷</span></p><p>Even though the schools were closed, some the building were reused and repurposed by the government.

| June 1, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today, I made my second attempt to reach Kiyomi Morimo <span class='ja'>清見森茂</span> by myself.  It's not too difficult to locate using Google Maps.  If you search for the neighborhood, Maps will give you a delightful outline: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d" title="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d">here</a>.  Looking on the map, there's only two ways to get to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>: come from the east, or come from the south.  My first attempt was coming from the east in which I ran into possible trouble.  Today's attempt was coming from the South, and going through the village of Shokawa <span class='ja'>荘川</span>.</p><p>If you follow the highway's frontage road south from the Hida Kiyomi entrance, about 15 minutes later, you'll come across a small farming neighborhood that has a road leading into the wilderness.  This road continues to follow a stream as it approaches Miboro Lake <span class='ja'>御母衣湖</span>,  Actually, right as that streams connects with the lake, you've arrived in the very southern tip of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.</p><p>Today, I drove to this neighborhood, and took the road into the forest.  After 10 minutes of driving, the pavement ends and turns into a rocky "dirt" road.  Still traversable, but at a much slower rate.  </p><p>As I continued through the forest, I actually came across some kind of neighborhood.  A house on stilts stood near this turn-off.  Looking at the map (36.081985, 137.002227), the road trails off but rejoined the main road not that much further, so it seemed like a "great" idea.  So, I decided to drive through this neighborhood.</p><p>The roads were actually paved, but were also totally covered by dried leafs, pine needles, some fallen branches, some fallen rocks, and some fallen trees.  Several times, I exited my car to clear the road for my car.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" /></p><p>I found 4 houses packed within this neighborhood.  Each house was on stilts, built in the middle of the forest.  There were no cars around, so I couldn't tell if anyone actually lived in them.  I would guess not.  At least not anyone of our society.  Bums or squatters could have been inside, but there's no way they could live without assistance from the outside world.  There were no gardens, or any livelihood at all.  Just an old house.</p><p>I did not pry.</p><p>However, Google Maps lied, and the roads that were certain to bring me back to the main road did not exist.  I turned my car around, and went back the way I came.</p><p>With that done, I continued on my way to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, and met my first obstruction: a big red gate.  The gates were at this point: 36.101633, 137.001209.  From the main road, these gates were about 23 minutes in.  Some other cars were already parked there, and an ashed fire pit was next to the white van.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" /></p><p>Past the gate was something I was very curious about.  On Google Maps, at point: 36.114263, 136.997079, the road is cut off as it hits a connecting stream.  On the other side of the stream, Maps marks a "walking only" road, which continues onward to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.  There's gotta be a bridge there, I thought.  Or some easy way to get across.</p><p>However, if the bridge was out, and I could walk across, Google Maps says it's about a 12 kilometer walk to where I considered a downtown area of Morimo.  Maps says that's a 2 hr 42 min hike, one way.  From my current position, I'm walking anyway.  But now there's an addition 2 kilometers to this possible bridge, which will add another 20-25 minutes.</p><p>Even though I needed to walk, I was still curious about the bridge, and walking that distance doesn't bother me.  So, I parked my car, grabbed my camera, ID, and water bottle, moved around the gate, and continued to walk down the road.  After 27 minutes, I reached that point on the map (36.114263, 136.997079), and HOLY SHIT!  The bridge actually exists!  Ha ha ha, I knew it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" /></p><p>But now I had a decision to make.  It's about 3:40pm.  I figured I could cover the 12k in about 2 hours at most, since it's a little more than half a half marathon length (23.1km).  That would get me back to my car around 8pm, I think, which is past sunset, and an absolutely bad idea.</p><p>I dunno… I couldn't simply stop, though.  So, I stupidly decided to continue.  I'll give myself until 5pm, then turn around.  Well, I didn't even last until 4pm when I came across an immovable barrier at point (36.119619, 136.988925), and immediately turned around.</p><p>As I turned the corner at that point, there was <b>a brown bear</b> in the middle of the road.</p><p>When I saw it, I thought it was a giant hyena, or some kind of wild dog.  It was big, though.  I'd say it was as big as I am.  It was facing directly at me, and it clearly and immediately saw me the instant I saw it.  My footsteps were making enough noise that it probably heard me coming.  I immediately recognized this situation as DANGER.  Without even thinking, I did a 180, and walked back the direction I came.  This all happened within a second.  The creature came into view, my brain said NOPE, and I am now walking back to my car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" /></p><p>I walked with the same attitude I had before seeing it to make it think I wasn't afraid or something.  And I was surveying the ground for anything I could use as a possible weapon if thing started stalking after me.  Also, I was still trying to figure out what I had just seen, and the likelihood of whether or not it would come after me, and if I were actually capable of defending myself.  Which was doubtful.  If that thing started chasing and attacking me, I'd be beaten down pretty quickly.  </p><p>And then I started thinking of that girl who was attacked by a bear.  And while the bear was eating her alive, she called her mom crying and panically explained the situation as it happened.  This one: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html">Daily Mail… sorry :(</a></p><p>After a few minutes of walking, and looking over my shoulder every couple of seconds, I figured it was far enough away, and that I could start running now.  I checked the time as well, so I could pinpoint this location later.  It was 3:56pm.</p><p>I made it back to Google's invisible bridge at 4:07pm.  Still no <b>bear</b> behind me.  And I made it back to my car at 4:28pm.  Still no bear.  Safe!</p><p>Again, I thought it was some kind of dog or hyena or something.  It had a long face, and body more like a dog or hyena.  Not a bear.  Or at least, the "bear" body image that always comes to mind.  Bears always seem so puffy.</p><p>Once at home, I started searching on Google to figure out what I had seen.  Apparently, Japanese wolves are extinct, and any wild dogs are no longer than 100cm (or 1 yard).  I searched for other wildlife in central Japan, and didn't find anything that fit the description in my head.  I searched for Japanese bears, and the following image is similar to the type of animal I saw:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" /></p><p>(This image was taken from <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387" title="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387">digitaljournal.com</a>)</p><p>It's pretty close.  It's hard to trust my memory since I only saw the thing for an instant, and even though I turned around, my brain was constantly fixated on that brief visual encounter.  Any details could be slightly skewed.  I remember that it's face was dark, and it's body was brown, somewhat light brown.  Though, it could've been in the sun, which made it appear more light.  Again, it had a thin slender long face.</p><p>It's still really early in the year, so it's slender features make sense.  Bears don't get their full "puffy" figures until the end of the year.</p><p>According to some other articles, most bears shouldn't attack humans, but HELL NO, I'm not going to put that to the test.  As much as I would like to return to this path with a full day and a mountain bike, coming across another bear is way too damn risky.</p><p>Also, brown bears are on the list of endangered species.  So, even if I do encounter another bear, and if that bear attacks me, and if I'm able to defend myself, and kill it, I'll have to pay some enormous fine, and probably go to jail.  There are stories about that ALL the time despite being self defense.</p><p>I think my next attempt in the wilderness of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span> will be under a more official capacity, and in a car.</p><p><br/>Anyway, the road to Morimo through Shokawa was quite beautiful. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kamioka Gattan Go!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kamioka-gattan-go">Kamioka Gattan Go!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 26, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The northeast most town in Hida City, is Kamioka <span class='ja'>神岡</span>.  It currently has about 10,000 people, but there used to be a lot more.  15 years ago, there were 30,000 residents.  Many of those people were employed in the various zinc mines throughout the town and region.</p><p>And then in 2003 (I think) the zinc mine were closed.  Apparently zinc was no longer as useful as it once was, and the companies sold, closed, or abandoned the mines in the area.  Almost all the staff was cut, and residents began leaving the town and moving elsewhere for work.</p><p>With the mass exodus of residents, it no longer made sense to keep the Kamioka rail line open, so on December 1st, 2006, the rail line was closed, and abandoned.</p><p>It's still abandoned today, and is a rather prominent and visible symbol of Kamioka's urban decay.</p><p>Today, these railways have a unique present to contrast their flourishing past.</p><div class='title'><b>Gattan Go!</b></div><p>These days, you can ride the rails yourself on a bicycle contraption.  A few years after the railway closed, the NPO Kamioka-town network NPO<span class='ja'>法人神岡町づくりネットワーク</span> opened the Gattan Go! service!  2 or more people can reserve one of these railway bicycles and journey along Kamioka's railway for about 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> to 1500<span class='ja'>円</span> per person.</p><p>This past weekend, a few ALTs and I reserved a 4 person bicycle, and traveled on the old Kamioka railway. :)</p><p>The railway course is about 3km to the end, and another 3km back.  It starts from the old Hida Onsen Station and continues to the Kamioka Mining Station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8304.webp" /></p><p>Here's the old Hida Onsen Station, or <span class='ja'>旧奥飛騨温泉口駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>おくひだ</span> <span class='ja'>おんせん</span> <span class='ja'>ぐち</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>).  It's now the central station for Gattan Go!  Inside there's a whole collection of trains, and some old photos of the line before it was decommissioned.  There's a Cafe outside, and a few other fun things.</p><p>We arrived a little early, so we looked at the photo spread of previous railway riders, and photos of the railway in different seasons.  It wasn't before too long that riders began returning from the time slot before us.  Almost 10 groups continued to show up around the bend, and arrive at the station.</p><p>At 4:30, the "foreman" had everyone in our time slot move into the briefing room.  He went through all the rules.  No getting off the bikes.  No stopping.  Always wear a helmet.  Blah, blah, blah…  You could still take photos, but you had to do so while staying on the bike.  Not a problem.</p><p>Luckily, our American group was the final group to leave the station, so we didn't have to worry about keeping a pace for everyone behind us.  We all hopped on the bike, and shoved off.</p><p>And it was a beautiful downhill ride. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8312.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8312.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8312.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8321.webp" /></p><p>The first station we went past is the Kamioka Oohashi (or Big Bridge) Station <span class='ja'>旧神岡大橋駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>かみおか</span> <span class='ja'>おおはし</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>), which is easy to identify with the Mushroom Public Bathroom next to the exit.  The station building was torn down, and removed.  The entrance gate is totally wide open, so anyone could easy walk to the platform, then take a look around the railway.</p><p>After continuing along further, we entered the first of two major tunnels on the route.  The first tunnel goes directly underneath the Kamioka elementary school.  And even though it's absolutely pitch black inside, it's straight, so, you can always see the entrance and exit.</p><p>Upon exited the tunnel, you reach the main Kamioka Station <span class='ja'>旧飛騨神岡駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>ひだ</span> <span class='ja'>かみおか</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>), which is elevated over the west end of town.  The former Kamioka station building is now a hair salon.  I don't know if you can actually access the station platform anymore.  I think you have to go through the inside of the building, and it was closed when I checked.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8346.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8347.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8350.webp" /></p><p>After we passed through Kamioka Station, we entered the second tunnel of the route, and this one is much longer than the first.  The "elementary school" tunnel is about 600m, I think?  This tunnel, the "Otsu Shrine" tunnel, is a bit longer at almost 1 kilometer.  And it curves in the middle, so there's a point where it's absolutely pitch black and you can't see either entrance or exit.  </p><p>It's just you (and your team) peddling into the darkness with no actual aim.</p><p>It's a bit creepy…</p><p>But, before we reached the light of the end of the tunnel, and were suddenly bathed in the light and heat of the day.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8355.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8361.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8369.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8369.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8369.webp" /></p><p>And after another 500m we go to the end of the line, the Kamioka Mining Station <span class='ja'>旧神岡鉱山前駅</span> (<span class='ja'>きゅう</span> <span class='ja'>かみおか</span> <span class='ja'>こうざん</span> <span class='ja'>まえ</span> <span class='ja'>えき</span>).  At this point, an attendant stopped everyone and turned the bikes around for the return journey.  We got to take a break, drink some water, and relax for a little while.</p><p>Before too long, we're back on the bike, and returning to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch.webp" /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8390_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8406.webp" /></p><p>Going from the Onsen Station to the Mining Station is pretty easy because the route is generally downhill.  It still feels really flat, though.  The return route is a fucking monster.  There were so many parts on the route where we kept peddling as much as we could, and we were still slowing down, and dragging.  I don't know if it was the bike we had, or if we're just that out of shape, but it was an actual workout to climb the tracks back to central.</p><p>We finally returned to the Onsen Station at 5:35.  A good 5 minutes late. :)  Good thing we were scheduled the last time slot of the day, and were the final group to depart.</p><p>Exhausted, and beat, we returned to our cars, and drove to a local yakiniku place for some delicious dinner.</p><p>Overall, it was a pretty fantastic and unique experience.  All of these old stations are pretty prominent in Kamioka, and after seeing them for the first time, I really wanted to get a better view.  Riding the bikes along these tracks was a great way to see everything up close, and take part of the history that was once the Kamioka railway.</p><p>As we finally departed Kamioka for the night, the tiny little castle shone beautifully in the darkening sky.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140525_kamioka_gattan/IMG_8459.webp" /></p><p>Another way to experience the old railways is on youtube.  There's a few videos that people recorded from back in the day of the train traveling from the current Kamioka Inotani Station <span class='ja'>神岡猪谷駅</span> all the way to the Hida Onsen Station.</p><p>This video was recorded in 1991: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpoF8ytO5OY</a></p><p>And this one is quite a bit more recent: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SYVI5abGtI</a></p><p>In both videos, you can clearly see a whole lot of tanker cars parked at the Onsen and Mining stations, which carried all the zinc and whatever else they extracted from the Kamioka mines.</p><p>That first video is really helpful because it lists all the stations of the now abandoned line between the Inotani Station and the Onsen station:</p><p><span class='ja'>猪谷</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>茂住</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>漆山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡鉱山</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>神岡大橋</span> <span class='ja'>ー</span> <span class='ja'>飛騨温泉</span></p><p>There's just 3 more stations outside of the central Kamioka area that are decommissioned: Hida Nakayama <span class='ja'>飛騨中山</span>, Mozumi <span class='ja'>茂住</span>, and Urushiyama <span class='ja'>漆山</span>.  From the parts of the rail line we weren't able to ride on, there are some really beautiful bridges, and tunnels that are very very long.  Especially between the Mining station and the Urushiyama Station <span class='ja'>漆山駅</span>.  I think this requires some more exploring in the future. :)</p><div class='title'><b><i>Update</i></b></div><p>Near the end of summer vacation, I went to these abandoned rail stations: <a href="/old/v7/kamioka-railway" title="/kamioka-railway">September 1st</a><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/takayama/7">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/takayama/5">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
