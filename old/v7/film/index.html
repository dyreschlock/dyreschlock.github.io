I instantly fell in love with this film when I saw it for the first time 7 years ago. I had been living in a foreign country for almost 5 years at that point teaching English, so I felt like it spoke to me directly.</p><p>Ever since I saw this film, I wanted to tell my students about it, and I had the chance the next week at my junior high school. <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Here's that post</a>. Since starting high school, I wanted to use it again in a much larger capacity. And I finally accomplished that this year.</p><p>After watching the film, we discussed the overall story and ideas before focusing on the theory of "switching brains" when using different languages.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story</b></div><p>The film begins with Louise (played by Amy Adams) narrating life to her daughter. The joy of her birth to the pain of her unexpected premature death. A person's life is often defined by moments outside of their control.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As Louise arrives at her university to teach a class about language, life is interrupted by alien spacecraft appearing in 12 locations in different countries throughout the world. There is no announcement from the spaceships, but every 18 hours, a chamber is opened allowing people to enter and have contact with the aliens.</p><p>During the chaos, Louise is contacted by U.S. Army Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) asking for her help to translate a message from the aliens. Impossible from just a recording, she, Weber, and Physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner) travel to Montana to the spaceship. They meet the aliens, but ultimately have no physical commonality to bridge communication. The aliens sound more like animals to us rather than sentient beings. (End of Part 1 in class)</p><p>Louise hits a breakthrough when she uses a whiteboard to write our language and show it to the aliens. Having a visual representation of our language allows the aliens to understand and reciprocate with their written language. This also allows Louise to have a tangible and concrete connection from their language to ours, given her a starting point to begin a rough method of translation and understanding.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Louise and Ian live at the army camp and spend every waking minute working on a method of translating the alien language. Every time the alien craft opens, Louse and Ian enter, and do their best to communicate with the aliens. From the written sentences, they build vocabulary and grammar, and they also build a device that can replicate the alien sentences and show them to the aliens.</p><p>Weeks have passed. They are finally near the point of being able to ask them, "What is the purpose of your visit?" They ask the question and get a response which translates to "Offer Weapon." This response creates conflict between Louise's team and the military execs who never fully trusted the aliens.

Looking through an English dictionary will give you plenty of words that roughly mean the same thing with small subtle differences. For anyone who has never thought about it before, these differences are often hard to identify, too. Like, what's the difference between <i>talk</i> and <i>speak</i>, or <i>hear</i> and <i>listen</i>? Any English speakers can tell you that these words have different meanings and uses, but can you clearly explain why they're different?</p><p>In addition, these subtle differences are being translated into another language and back. The words of a language carry more than just their meaning. The meanings are often derived from the lineage of the country's culture, and their usage is determined from the society that came from that culture. When the society and culture of two languages are completely separate with completely separate pasts and values, you lose a lot in translation and need more context.</p><p>This spoke to me directly being an American teaching English in Japan. English and Japanese are two of the most distant languages on Earth. At the base level, our writing, alphabet, grammar, and vocabulary are totally different. But, going up one level, our languages are also separated by different pasts and cultures which have created words used in completely different settings with different weights. To go from one language to the other requires more knowledge than just a dictionary.</p><p>Now, multiply this idea by another dimension to try and make contact with an alien species whose planet, biology, and even perception of reality are completely foreign to us.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Language from Culture</b></div><p>Let's look at two specific sentences in Japanese and English.</p><p><pre>I watch TV at home.<br/><span class='ja'>私は家でテレビを見ます。</span></pre></p><p>The order of English grammar has the subject, verb, and predicate of the sentence in that order. The Japanese sentence starts with the subject, but it ends with the verb. All the further details of the sentence are given before closing with the action.</p><p>Overall, I think English is a very <b>direct</b> language. With any sentence, we immediately state the information of <b>who</b> does <b>what</b>. Any other information that builds context to that situation is given after. That information is of secondary importance. Most European languages follows this same pattern, too.</p><p>Throughout history, European nations have focused on outward expansion and conquering. Greeks and Romans, then English, Spanish, and Portuguese through the world, then Americans in North America. Through our history of conflict and war, we have more aggressive and direct personalities, which is reflected in our direct language.</p><p>The Japanese language is the near opposite. Grammatically, the action is stated last. Their sentences care more about the details of the situation before deciding on the action. Because of this, Japanese is often described as an <b>indirect</b> language.</p><p>This also comes from history. Japan is a small island, and it didn't take long for all available space to be taken. Villages and settlements of people had nowhere to expand. If someone was exiled from a village, they couldn't make their own village. They would have to be accepted by another village, but that village would be suspicious of why they were exiled in the first place.</p><p>People needed a way to work together and not cause conflict. Direct language is often harsh, so their communication became soft and less direct, creating a more gentle and nice society. The Japanese language we have today came from these early ideals.</p><p>In both cases, our histories and culture are reflected in the language we use today. This is also true with the alien's language in the film.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Immersion / "Switching Brains"</b></div><p>Louise is often able to read the alien sentences without using their translation device. Knowing about the small subtle differences in language, every small variation in the alien sentences brings up questions about why. Why is this different? What does this mean? How does this compare to a previous sentence with the same mark? Every day, she asks these questions to herself as she studies their language and refines their translations.</p><p>This immersion also brings about stress. She doesn't get a lot of sleep, so she often daydreams about her daughter. Ian notices this, and asks her about her dream. "When you dream, are you able to dream in their language?"</p><p>This overall immersion is the center of Arrival's story.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ian mentions that when you immerse yourself in a foreign language, you're able to rewire your brain to think in that language. People usually refer to this as "switching brains." When someone truly learns a language, they live it. They think in that language and can respond naturally in that language without ever using or thinking about their native language.</p><p>In addition, as people think and speak that foreign language, their personality can change to fit the culture of that language. As an example, I tend to speak softer when using Japanese and louder when using English.</p><p>Throughout the film, as Louise uses the alien language, and thinks in the alien language, she has also slowly adapted to the culture of the aliens without realizing it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Time</b></div><p>An alien sentence has no beginning and end, and it's written all at once without any order. This is completely different than any language on Earth. All of our sentences have a specific order. The components of the sentences might have a different order, but there's always a beginning and end, and language is also spoken in that same order.</p><p>The alien language becomes a visual representation for their perception of reality because their perception of time also has no beginning or end. An alien views their entire life all at once. As they live in their present, they also live in their past and their future. They know all of the events that will happen in their life as they live them simultaneously.</p><p>As Louise studied the language, she slowly gained this perception through the daydreams of her daughter, who is not born yet.

Usually when people mention the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, there are referring to Linguistic Relativity. This is what Ian Donnelly does in the film. </p><p><b>Linguistic Relativity</b> means that when you learn and immerse yourself in a new language, you can also learn and change to the thought process of that language. When people "switch brains" to use a foreign language, they're also thinking like the people from that country and can view the world and situations in the same way. A person's thinking can change <u>relative</u> to the situation.</p><p><b>Linguistic Determinism</b> is the opposite. A person's thought process and view of the world is <u>determined</u> by their native language, or primary language. They can still learn new languages, but their thoughts and actions will always be influenced by their native language and culture.</p><div class='title'><b>Essay Topic 2</b></div><p>Japanese students spend a long time learning English in school. Their first classes are in elementary school, and become more numerous through junior high and senior high school. Even so, there's still a gap between our languages that prevents general students from becoming totally fluent. Many of the students still stick to the fundamentals of Japanese culture. As such, students don't have a clear linguistic foundation to truly answer whether Linguistic Relativity or Linguistic Determinism is more correct because they've never been able to immerse themselves in a different language or culture. </p><p>But, school is an overwhelming part of their lives, especially at my school. Students who take my writing course have classes for 12 hours each weekday, and another 6 or 8 hours on Saturdays. All of their time is spent studying and doing work for school. So, instead of language, what about different school subjects? Students who are often good at math are often not good at humanities, such as English or Japanese. The reverse is true, too. So, students answer the following question for the current essay:</p><p><div><b>Which is more correct: the idea of Cognitive Relativity or Cognitive Determinism?</b></div></p><p>Now, the Hypothesis states that different school subjects have different ways of thinking. For example, in math class, questions only have one answer and have a logically way of finding that answer. A student learns about formulas and methods of deriving that answer. For language class, the method of thinking is totally different. Language requires thinking that is far more fluid. There isn't a single way of answering a question, and answers can sometimes be long or short depending on the person.</p><p>So for <b>Cognitive Relativity</b>, when students focus and immerse themselves in various subjects, they are able to change their thinking to match the thought process of subject. And for <b>Cognitive Determinism</b>, students have a best subject or a favorite subject, and because they feel most confident in that subject, it ultimately determines how they think. When studying their weak subjects, they want to use the thought process of their strong subjects.</p><p>So, is it possibly for people to "switch their brains" when studying?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Essay Writing</b></div><p>The essay follows the 4-paragraph structure of having an Introduction, Body, and Conclusion. The <b>Introduction</b> introduces the film, its story, and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. It finishes by posing the above question <u>only</u>. The question is not answered first; it's answered last, in the conclusion.</p><p>The two paragraphs in the <b>Body</b>, which typically provide reasons for the answer, look at both sides of the argument. One paragraph focuses on <b>Cognitive Relatively</b> and how the student can change their thinking when focusing on different subjects. The other paragraph focuses on <b>Cognitive Determinism</b> and how it's difficult for students to focus on or understand subjects they aren't good at.</p><p>In the <b>Conclusion</b>, having looked at both sides of the question, students make a decision on which is more correct. They show why their opinion is true and why the opposite is false. The essay is concluded with a positive statement about the future. What good things will happen in the future if people understood your idea?</p><p>Here's the overall essay structure: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f__nTSmGOkpSRFfPuwdenluPgW5GQXMR/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f__nTSmGOkpSRFfPuwdenluPgW5GQXMR/view">gdrive/Arrival - Essay Structure.pdf</a></p><p>Because the class is taught once a week, the movie and explanation could take a month. Each paragraph also takes a month. There's also summer vacation, which is another month. Students write their paragraphs in their notebook and I check them for errors in their contents, like weak or missing explanations. Paragraphs are only finished when I've marked them with an "okay." With all paragraphs complete, students will type their paragraph in a Google Document and create an APA-style report, which follows <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fe0TK5KawBZIWQMZhKq836d0NekSl5h0/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fe0TK5KawBZIWQMZhKq836d0NekSl5h0/view?usp=drive_link">this format</a>. </p><p>All in all, class takes about 7 or 8 months. That seems like a long time to write a 3-4 page essay, but Japanese students have never written anything like this before. Many of them will never write something like this again because they'll focus on something else in university. </p><p>Because of all the work they put into this essay, I print them out and put them in rail files, just like an American University. I'm proud of all the work they've done, so I want them to be proud of it, too, and have something to keep and hold from their experience.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here are some examples of student work, with the cover page removed: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fewLzExX3HbqIFMPrzO6WbyAuTlS5bxn/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fewLzExX3HbqIFMPrzO6WbyAuTlS5bxn/view?usp=drive_link">1</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fkj5YhLVRNNmgCWkMP0S3_bHaRbCtWHJ/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fkj5YhLVRNNmgCWkMP0S3_bHaRbCtWHJ/view?usp=drive_link">2</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fks3eYxoHfL610cXayajQMmKpZqgd5UI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fks3eYxoHfL610cXayajQMmKpZqgd5UI/view?usp=drive_link">3</a></p><div class='title'><b>Debate</b></div><p>With enough time remaining before finals, students can use their essays in a Japanese English debate style format. The class is divided into two teams based on how they're answered the question in their essay. Relativity v. Determinism.</p><p>In teams, they discuss their essays and come up with the 3 best reasons for why their opinion is correct. These 3 reasons are spoken by group members as their <b>Opening Statement</b>. Each team gives their opening statement, and the other team takes notes of the opening statement for the next part. (I also write them on the board and online for students to review.)</p><p>Next is the <b>Attack</b>. After receiving the other team's 3 best points, teams come back together and discuss why the opposing team's reasons are not true. Each best point should have a team member attacking it. After discussion, each team will give their Attack speeches, and the other teams will take notes. (I write these down, too.)</p><p>Next is the <b>Defense</b>, which works a lot like the Attack. After receiving the opposing team's attack, teams discuss why that attack was weak or incorrect and reinforce their best points. The Defense does not reinforce their own attacks. After discussion, once again, each team will have its members deliver the Defense speech.</p><p>In this debate format, there's a final speech called the <b>Summary Speech</b>. Teams would give a speech stating their best points, why the best points of the opposing team were wrong, how the opposing team didn't correctly defend their points, and how their team correctly defending their own points. It's a bit much for students to do all of this for the first time, so I do the summary for them as a way of concluding the class.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Evaluation</b></div><p>Overall, students are evaluated on their progress of writing the essay in their notebooks and meeting deadlines. The final report is harshly graded by any mistakes in print, and also being turned in on-time. By the end, everything should be perfect, so any mistakes are made through carelessness of typing of putting together their report. My class's overall grade this year was 95%, so it all worked out. Only one student got a B, which brought down the average.</p><p>Overall, I've had this film on my mind for 8 years since its release, but I think I can finally put it down after this last year of explaining it, reading about it, and writing about it again and again.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Emperor and The Imperial Palace 皇居" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/emperor-and-the-imperial-palace">Emperor and The Imperial Palace 皇居</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This was announced to the nation on August 15th, 1945, seventy-nine years ago. In the following days, officers of the United States military came to Japan, and oversaw the occupation which would rebuild Japan.</p><p>In these first few days, the American public wanted immediately and swift revenge for Pearl Harbor and Japan's involvement in the war. It was easy to place a target on the figurehead of Japan, Emperor Hirohito. To the typical American, the Emperor was like a king, and a king commands its armies to attack. So, surely Emperor Hirohito commanded Japan's army and navy to attack Pearl Harbor and enter the war.</p><p>As Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to lead the occupation, one of his first assignments was given to General Bonner Fellers. This assignment was to determine the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the war. Did he give the command to attack?

After arriving in Tokyo, various members of the Japanese military are arrested, and Fellers oversees the operation understanding how these officers value sacrifice in the wake of defeat.</p><p>The arrested officers are interrogated and seemingly uncooperative.

Fellers (and Matthew Fox's acting) clearly shows a love and respect for Japan, but he is constantly beat down, turned away, and disrespected by its people. He understands the damned future Japan would have without an Emperor, so he continues to fight for the answers despite the constant problems. </p><p>This feeling of frustration is the initial reason why this film stayed with me. I immediately identified with these feelings having lived here for a few years when seeing it for the first time. This feeling of working towards the same goal as others, but being pushed aside because I'm a perceived outsider, thus being perceived as an opponent or someone that wouldn't understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Honne and Tatemae <span class='ja'>本音と建前</span></b></div><p>After watching the film recently with my Japanese language students, I had forgotten that it spent some time explaining Japanese culture. One of the key points of the film was a flashback between Fellers and his fictional girlfriend's uncle, General Kajima. The uncle explains <b>Honne</b> and <b>Tatemae</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp"></a></p><p><b>Tatemae</b> is the way that things appear. The uncle explains to Fellers that when you look at Japan (in 1930s/40s), you see the most advanced and westernized country in all of Asia. <b>Honne</b> is the way they really are. Underneath this westernized surface is the true heartbeat of Japan, which runs on the ancient warrior code of loyalty and obedience. From this explanation that Fellers learned before the war, he understands that without the Emperor as a symbol to guide the public, Japan would fall into chaos.</p><p>This concept of Honne and Tatemae is ever present in modern Japan. They consider and cherish group harmony over everything else. They do this because on the surface conflict will create rifts between individuals and eventually break that harmony. So, they often contribute and conform to the group to avoid social strife. This is why everyone perceives Japanese people as super nice and accommodating.</p><p>That's not to say Japanese don't complain. When they do complain, they complain to their own social circles about something outside of it. It's often a way to bring people in their circle together. And if they complain more outwardly (like on Twitter), it's as an individual completely detached from their circles.</p><p>Maybe this sounds obvious and not really foreign to America, but it's something that foreign people who come to Japan often struggle with, especially when a Japanese person says one thing, but then does the opposite. The classic example is being invited to someone's home. They'll say, "You should come over to my house." They'll often do this as way to be nice and create harmony, but usually they expect you to decline, something like, "Oh, I'd love to some day." They don't want you to say, "Ok, when?"</p><div class='title'><b>Group Harmony formed from Ancient History</b></div><p>I don't remember if the subject was Honne and Tatemae, but one of my college professors once mentioned that the culture of group harmony and being nice was born from being such a small country with limited resources. </p><p>Japan has very clear natural outer borders, and plenty of mountains creating internal borders, too. Space for creating towns with agriculture was limited to few areas. Self-sustaining communities didn't have a lot of extra food, so if you stole from your neighbors or created problems, you would be banished from the town. Other towns and settlements also had limited resources, so they wouldn't just accept an outsider. And even if you proved your worth, they would still be wary of accepting you completely.</p><p>As such, this created the culture of group harmony above self interests. And, this is perhaps how the idea of Honne and Tatemae was formed.</p><p>Compare this to Western Europe and modern-day Americans. Our civilizations have always been formed from expanding our borders into uncharted areas. Greeks and Romans established their cities and expanded to conquer new ones. Americans broke away from Europe and expanded and "conquered" North America. </p><p>In America in the Wild West, if we stole from our neighbor and pissed off people, it wouldn't matter if we were banished. We could easily pick a direction and find new fertile land to start a new farm. People were constantly traveling to new places, so there was always new work available, and people dealt with problems head on.</p><div class='title'><b>Direct and Indirect Language</b></div><p>You could also say that the insular culture of Japan and expansive culture of America and Europe influenced both Japanese and English languages.</p><p>In general, English is a very direct language compared to Japanese, which is built into our grammar. Our sentences always begin with the subject followed by the verb.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.</code></p><p>We always want to know <code>who</code> is doing <code>what</code> when we talk. All the other details of the sentence follow afterwards, when, why, where, how often, with whom, etc.</p><p>Japanese starts with the subject, too, although it's often not needed if the subject of conversation is clear. All the other details are expressed first before concluding the sentence with the verb.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は</span> <span class='ja'>毎日</span> <span class='ja'>学校に</span> <span class='ja'>歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>You could say that a speaker wants to create a full picture of a situation first before completing and ending their thought. Comparing to English, we get the most important information said immediately, and the listener can then decide on the importance of the later details.</p><p>Going back to the earlier example of inviting someone...  In English, if you wanted to refuse someone's invitation, it's perfectly fine to just say no. "Hey, would you like to come over this weekend?" "Sorry, I can't." You wouldn't necessarily need to provide any context. In Japanese, though, outright refusing an invitation with such a direct response could be considered rude. "<span class='ja'>すみません、ちょっと。。</span>" "This weekend is not good for me." "I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement." You want to make a nice soft rejection sandwich.</p><p>The idea of culture or cognition influencing language or language influencing culture or cognition is the central focus in another one of my favorite movies: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.</p><p>Anyways... back to Emperor.</p><div class='title'><b>Dai-Ichi Life Building <span class='ja'>第一生命</span></b></div><p>As Douglas MacArthur and Bonner Fellers arrived in Tokyo, their offices were set up in the Dai-Ichi Life building, across the moat from the Imperial Palace grounds.

That same tree shows up in the same location behind Fellers (Matthew Fox), although the depth of field is pulled WAY in.</p><p>In reality, I couldn't find any information that said Fellers actually entered the Palace grounds for an interview. Also, would it have been appropriate to have entered through this gate? A <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5326.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5326.webp">nearby plaque</a> states the the Sei-mon gate is only used for official diplomatic use by the Emperor, State guests, and ambassadors. Crossing through it is part of ceremony. The other two northern gates are for workers and guests. But, this was 80 years ago, post-war, and technically he had official approval from MacArthur making Fellers and extension of MacArthur whom the Japanese government viewed as the highest order.</p><div class='title'><b>Accuracy v. Story Telling</b></div><p>Overall, Emperor takes a lot of liberties with history in order to tell its story. Some of the smaller ones have been covered already, but the biggest inaccuracy is the love story between Fellers and Shimada Aya. Their story is completely fictional as Fellers was already married to Dorothy Dysart in 1925. They stayed married with 3 children until Feller's death in 1973.</p><p>The overall love story was most likely added to make the story relatable to general audience. Do people really want another boring historical drama based on facts? If Fellers has "love" for Japan, we gotta show that love somehow. Love for a woman is the easiest way to do this. Plus, people like a good tragic love story. Let's do that.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Critics hated this part of the story because it was so cliche. They also felt that the film focused on their love story too much when they had a wealth of history to draw story from.</p><p>But, for someone that knows nothing of the subject matter, I think the movie does well portraying the events in the film and introducing the audience to these events that were pivotal in created modern Japan. It also does well introducing people to some parts of Japanese culture they probably aren't familiar with. So many war movies focus on heroes in battle and show the horror of war. Very very few films focus on creating peace through reconciliation rather than fighting.</p><p>Emperor is a fantastic under appreciated film.</p><div class='title'><b>Imperial Palace <span class='ja'>皇居</span></b></div><p>After showing the palace guards MacArthur's approval, Fellers enters the Palace and interviews Sekiya. Through researching these locations, I noticed that the Imperial Palace offered tours. Unfortunately, these tours are only outside the palace buildings. But, they're still within the palace grounds.</p><p>You could make reservations, but the majority of people just show up. They allow the first 300 people who show up an hour before the tour to join.

I was the second person in line starting at 8:00am. The other dude said he arrived around 7:30am.</p><p>My friends showed up around 8:45am with around 120 people in the line? So, ultimately, I didn't have to be so afraid of missing this chance. But, it was alright. Around 9:30am, they allowed tour members to enter the Kikyo-mon Gate and wait at the visitor center for orientation. They explained the route of the tour, and had pamphlets available. Tour guides were available in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Although, you could also scan a QR code to listen to all the details yourself. A small gift shop was also located in the visitor center, so you can buy random stuff with the imperial seal on it.

Perhaps both a semi-wide shot and a zoomed-in close up. You might need a camera with a strong zoom lens. Then, put your friend or partner on the tour. Have them wait around until the tour clears the bridge so they're the last person off the bridge. As they exit, face the camera for a couple good shots.</p><p>It would take a bit of preparation and patience, but it could be worth it. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Tour</b></div><p>Overall, the tour was fine. Sharing the tour with 300+ people means barely being able to hear the tour guide over constant talking. Everyone was taking the same photos, too, so not particularly unique. Occasionally, someone would step on something forbidden and get yelled at. Once or twice, it seemed like someone important was in a car that drove by.</p><p>The Imperial Palace reminds me a lot of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Both are the center pieces of ancient government in their cities, but they aren't represented by a massive multi-storied castle like Himeiji or Matsumoto. Though, I suppose the Emperor would want to be shown as modest. The Emperor of Japan isn't known for flaunting wealth and status over the citizens of their country.</p><p>I suppose the East Palace Gardens are meant to show off the beauty of the palace. Those are also within the palace grounds, but are freely open to the public most days. We skipped that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ultimately, I think the view of Fushimi-yagura with the Sei-mon Gate and bridges together ends up the most scenic area of the palace, which is probably why the used it for the film. If you have time, I think the tour is worthwhile, but if you only have a few days in Tokyo and time is short, you could take a look around the outside and be satisfied enough. :)</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lights Out" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lights-out">Lights Out</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Films that end up working really well for class aren't necessarily the ones that you'd expect, nor are ones you'd really like on a personal level.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Lights Out is PG-13, which makes the film pretty tame by horror standards. It also makes use of constant jump-scares and startles to accomplish its job of spooking the audience, a device that really undermines the weight of a truly scary moment. Overall, the acting isn't bad, but there are some goofy moments. The script is the same way. On my own, I probably would've skipped to end, halfway though.</p><p>But, many of these problems end up working pretty well in class. The acting is good enough to make each scene believable and understandable for students. The script pushes the story along and there aren't any glaring plot holes or problems. The jump-scares turn the movie into a game for students as they try to make their friends jump at the wrong moments. The PG-13 rating works, too, as I'm not showing gore to students.</p><div class='title'><b>Monster</b></div><p>The film has some unique ideas, too, bringing its monster to life and showing its limitations in a very understandable way.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As we learn later in the film, <b>Diana</b> was a patient in a mental hospital over 30 years ago. She suffered from a rare skin condition which burns her skin when exposed to light. The doctors tried an experimental procedure by blasting light rays at her (good idea), which incinerated her skin and body, reducing her to ash.</p><p>Her spirit still remained within the mind and body of a young girl she possessed at the hospital. Now, Diana only has a physical presence in the dark and shadows. When exposed to light, she disappears. But, she's still there.</p><p>They do some fun things with this. A character turns off the lights in a room and she appears in the shadows confusing the person. She disappears and reappears in sync with a neon sign at night as a character realizes someone is there. Spoilers, but my favorite use of this effect is at the end when police officers try shooting her. The muzzle flash from the gun is enough to make her disappear and the bullet goes right through her.</p><div class='title'><b>Commitment</b></div><p>The closest thing to a theme the film has is the idea of commitment and abandonment.</p><p><b>Rebecca</b> is the main character, played by Teresa Palmer. She is dating, not-dating her boyfriend, not-boyfriend <b>Bret</b>, played by Alexander DiPersia. The film starts with them in her apartment at night. Bret wants to stay for the night and he wants their relationship to move forward, but Rebecca pushes him out.

Her mother fights back because Rebecca ran away after her father left and wouldn't support her. Rebecca also thinks that with the death of Martin's father in the opening of the film, Martin will suffer the same way as she did as a child.</p><p>She takes Martin, and they leave their mother at home, crying.

Students get copies of the script with missing words and sentences. While watching the scenes, they try to catch the words, and write them into the script. But, these scenes lead us to performance tests.</p><p>Performance Tests are done in pairs of students. For this first scene, one student is Becca and one student is Bret. These tests aren't just about remembering the lines and saying them. They must express themselves using the feelings of the characters through their words, gestures, eye contact, and movements.</p><p>The scene itself doesn't have any overwhelming gestures and movements expressing their feelings. It's almost all internal. Becca feels that she's doing the right thing by taking Martin away from her mother, and she feels hurt that Bret doesn't support her. Bret is clearly expressing his views on her actions and maybe suggesting that there's a better way.</p><p>"You should leave now," Becca says to end their conversation. Bret leaves as Becca stares straight, not looking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Check the <a href="/courses/lights-out" title="/courses/lights-out">Course Page</a> for grading criteria.</p><div class='title'><b>Next Performance</b></div><p>Over night, Diana comes to Becca's apartment and attacks her.

Its ideas of language learning and development significant struck me because deal with the differences of language and culture on a daily basis in my life and my work living in a foreign country.</p><p>I wrote about these ideas before, and how they inspired me to talk about them to my junior high school classes at the time. You can read them here: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival thoughts from February 2017</a>.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2017-02-27-20h44m21s410.webp" /></p><p>This year, once again, I'm using this film in my classes to talk about language and learning. My high school class will watch the whole film, and try to understand how the idea of environment and thinking determines the language that society speaks.</p><p>The purpose of the assignment is to understand the ideas the film discusses and not focus so much on the direct translation of what is said. Therefore, I needed Japanese subtitles for the film. English subtitles are pretty easy to find online, but almost every other language is a mixed-bag of low quality machine generated garbage. Japanese subtitles even moreso because of how distant it is from English.</p><p>So, I created a subtitle file that has both English and Japanese, timed perfectly with each other, and each line of dialogue having complete sentences and meaning side-by-side.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CO-YSG_3XooTjyWdDMuX3qAOSNbClRJ/view">drive/ Arrival.2016.1080p.BluRay.x264-[YTS.AG].EnJpDual.ass</a></p><p>I didn't completely translate it myself. I found some Japanese subtitles already created. But, it had several errors and several timings were wrong. All of those problems have been fixed and timed perfectly with the English script.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival/vlcsnap-2023-10-12-09h54m55s977.webp" /></p><p>The subtitles are in ASS format because SRT does not support dual languages. ASS overwrites size and color, so you'll need to modify the file if you want to change any of that. Although, the size is specifically set for some long sentences to fit perfectly, so I would recommend not enlarging them.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dune" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dune">Dune</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 2, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dune is like a dream. The film is told with subtle movements, occasionally abstract visuals, and ambient overwhelming music that guides you forward through the story. There are a few action sequences, but they serve more as a bullet point to the overall story being told.</p><p>It is directed by Denis Villenueve, who also directed Arrival and Blade Runner 2049, two of my absolute favorite films of the last few years. The motion picture score is done by Hans Zimmer, who wrote the music of Blade Runner 2049 and many Christopher Nolan films. While his Nolan scores are very similar, the music of Dune sets itself apart to build a dreamlike state.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-17h59m05s319_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Story of Dune</b></div><p>The story of Dune begins its focus on Paul Atreides, son of Duke Leto Atreides and heir to their House. House Atreides has become strong in both political and military power within the houses of the known universe, so the Emperor decides to install them as fief of Arrakis, Dune, deposing House Harkonen. House Harkonen have a long hatred of the Atreides, and the Emperor uses this opportunity to push the Harkonens to wipeout House Atreides.</p><p>Paul is the son of Lady Jessica, a devout member of the Bene Gesserit, a secret order of women who train their bodies and minds to obtain superhuman abilities seen as magic to outsiders. Over centuries, they have carefully steered bloodlines of the powerful Houses of the universe to birth a human with the most powerful mental abilities ever seen. They believe this person would be able to control the known universe and bring everlasting peace. Lady Jessica gave birth to Paul in defiance of the order, giving him the seeds of this power. </p><p>Arrakis is the most politically important planet in the universe. The surface is covered in desert, and within the sands is a substance called spice. Spice is a powerful hallucinogen that will unlock a person's mind to its full capabilities. Genetically engineered and breed humans of the Spacing Guild use its power to unlock intergalactic space travel allowing humans to travel across galaxies. It is the most important and priceless substance in the universe. Those who control Arrakis harvest the spice and sell it within the universe's market, giving them immense wealth.</p><p>Prior to Paul's arrival on Arrakis, he has dreams showing his possible futures. On Arrakis, these dreams lead him to understanding the culture of native Arrakins known as Fremen. Spice opens and unlocks his mind to more dreams powerful and predictive. As his House is attacked and destroyed by the Harkonens, he and his mother are forced in the desert where the spice surrounds him. They find the Fremen and are accepted into their city.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h51m32s110_t.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Meaning of Dune</b></div><p>Dune 2021 is only Part 1 of a long long story that lasts thousands of years. It's doubtful that this movie series will actually make it that far, though. I think Villeneuve has said he only plans on adapting Paul's story, and not continuing the story of his children which continue into millennia. There is such a huge time gap, and it's somewhat disconnected from the purpose of the story, anyway.</p><p>Overall, the meaning and purpose of Dune is to show the consequences of faith and charismatic leadership.</p><p>The Bene Gesserit have seeded prophecy across the universe. Over generations, simple rumors and tales of a promised warrior destined to save their people from evil has turned into religion and faith. These religions consume planets and create populations of devote followers. All under the guise of the Bene Gesserit projecting themselves as deities.</p><p>The Arrakins and Fremen see Paul arrive on Dune and they see this prophet. Paul's interest and obsession of Arrakis as well as his mental conditioning allows him to quickly adapt and understand their culture. Arrakins confuse this as prophecy. All they have ever known is oppression and with the emergence of hope, they cling to it and force themselves and Paul into it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h56m02s574_t.webp" /></p><p>Spoilers, but this will be the center-piece of Dune Part 2. Continuing with further spoilers, ultimately, this holy crusade is inevitable and worlds worth of people and civilizations die as a result. That'll be Dune Part 3, which I hope to god they are able to make.</p><div class='title'><b>The Weight of Responsibility</b></div><p>Something Dune Part 1 does exceedingly well is show how Paul takes reluctant responsibility. There have been many stories of reluctant heroes, and they always whine about not wanting to do what they have to do. Paul states at the beginning that he does not want to lead.</p><p>With the death of his father, he is now Duke Atreides. He doesn't try to ignore his potential political power as head of his House. He thinks of ways of how to use it to turn the situation into his favor. He accepts his responsibility.</p><p>In the final act of the film, a Fremen warrior forces him into combat where the victor is determined by the death of the other. Paul easily outmatches him, but attempts to find a middle ground having never actually killed before. While other stories would have the hero give up or whine about it, Paul understands that he must kill. And so he does.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h57m43s178_t.webp" /></p><p>This death weighs on him. Yes, it's his first kill, but it's also the first direct casualty on his path forward. A path that he is forced to take and he will not back down from. He confirms this by saying that his road leads into the desert, not off world. He takes responsibility for what he must do, but also feels the weight of it.</p><div class='title'><b>The Design of Dune</b></div><p>While the story subtly builds, the design and music become the most dynamic parts of the film. The technology and structures of Dune are never explained in the film, so we're presented with vehicles and tools that appear to work like magic, their shapes often abstract. Many shots in the film show their immense scale. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h00m35s403_t.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h10m22s833_t.webp" /></p><p>The size of a single person cannot even be measured against these enormous objects. However, their reach and power extends far beyond their size.</p><p>Every person in Dune is descent from humans. Over millennia of genetic engineering, conditioning, and life on distant separate planets have turned many human sub-specie into something alien. Their design make them feel alien, too, unlike other science fiction works.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h01m46s188_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h01m46s188_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h01m46s188_t.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h04m06s574_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h04m06s574_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h04m06s574_t.webp" /></p><p>Visually, I think Dune is stunning.

Prior to the film's release, Hans Zimmer released <b>The Dune Sketchbook</b>, which featured music from the movie but presented them in a meandering build, like he was trying to find the sound from his ideas, like an artist uses a sketchbook. As such, some tracks are very even and don't really work together as a complete album.</p><p>A few weeks later, <b>Dune The Motion Picture Soundtrack</b> was released. This album had 22 tracks of score that was directly included in the film. No extras or changes like the Sketchbook. However, tracks that were extended in the Sketchbook were not included in the Soundtrack. </p><p>After the movie was released, I combined both albums together to create a more complete musical journey analogous to the build of the film. Some sketchbook tracks didn't work as they were too uneven, so I put Moon Over Caladan first, and removed Song of the Sisters. If you did include Sone of the Sisters, it would go after The One, but I think it breaks up the movement from the Gom Jabbar to Leaving Caladan. It also has redundant sounds from Bene Gesserit.</p><p>Here is my arranged tracklisting combining both albums.</p><table class="tracklisting"><tr><td class="number">1.</td><td class="title">Moon Over Caladan</td><td class="notes">The Dune Sketchbook — Track 6</td></tr><tr><td class="number">2.</td><td class="title"> Dream of Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">3.</td><td class="title"> Herald of the Change </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">4.</td><td class="title">I See You in My Dreams</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 2 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">5.</td><td class="title"> Bene Gesserit </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">6.</td><td class="title"> Gom Jabbar </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">7.</td><td class="title"> The One </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">—</td><td> Song of the Sisters </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 1 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">8.</td><td class="title">Paul's Dream</td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 5 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">9.</td><td class="title"> Leaving Caladan </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 6 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">10.</td><td class="title"> House Atreides </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 3 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">11.</td><td class="title"> Arrakeen </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">12.</td><td class="title"> Ripples in the Sand </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">13.</td><td class="title"> The Shortening of the Way </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 4 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">14.</td><td class="title"> Visions of Chani </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 9 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">15.</td><td class="title"> Night on Arrakis </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 10 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">16.</td><td class="title"> Armada </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 11 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">17.</td><td class="title"> Burning Palms </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 12 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">18.</td><td class="title"> Stranded </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 13 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">19.</td><td class="title"> Blood for Blood </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 14 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">20.</td><td class="title"> The Fall </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 15 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">21.</td><td class="title"> Holy War </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 16 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">22.</td><td class="title"> Sanctuary </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 17 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">23.</td><td class="title"> Premonition </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 18 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">24.</td><td class="title"> Ornithopter </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 19 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">25.</td><td class="title"> Sandstorm </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 20 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">26.</td><td class="title"> Shai-hulud </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 7 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">27.</td><td class="title"> Stillsuits </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 21 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">28.</td><td class="title"> Mind Killer </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 8 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">29.</td><td class="title"> My Road Leads into the Desert </td><td class="notes"> Dune Soundtrack — Track 22 </td></tr><tr><td class="number">30.</td><td class="title"> Grains of Sand </td><td class="notes"> The Dune Sketchbook — Track 9 </td></tr></table><p>A third album was released to accompany an art book, <b>The Art and Soul of Dune</b>. All of these tracks are ambient versions of music already included in the previous two albums. It's meant as a background accompaniment as you read and view the content of the book. Overall, because they're too ambient and usually redundant, they don't really fit into my arrangement.</p><div class='title'><b>The Lore of Dune</b></div><p>Dune has always been a story and world that many people have considered impossible to adapt (yet this is the third adaptation). After watching the 1984 film and 2000 television mini-series, it seems like it's pretty easy to adapt. Although, both productions are severely flawed. Also, I've never read the book, so I don't know what I'm talking about.</p><p>Apparently the books are incredibly dense with lore that would completely slow down and obscure any movie or TV show. Watching videos on YouTubes and reading about Dune online, completes the picture for me as Dune 2021 skips over A LOT of stuff.</p><p>Prior to watching to watching Dune 2021 in theaters, I didn't know anything about the story or lore of Dune. What I had seen before, I had completely forgotten. But, I was still able to understand character motivations and what everyone was doing. The story in Dune 2021 is presented well enough that you don't need encyclopedic knowledge of the source material. On the reverse side, if you have this encyclopedic knowledge, I think it only enhances what is going on.</p><p>You don't need to know that humans have completely rejected computers and robots, and that people have been engineered, trained, and conditioned into biological thinking computers, called <I>mentats</I>. That's what this guy is, by the way.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h21m51s854_t.webp" /></p><p>The movie doesn't tell you that Paul has also been trained as a mentat, which gives him the ability to learn about Arrakis and the Fremen incredibly quickly.</p><p>Everything you need to know about the overall lore of Dune is hinted at or mentioned briefly. Despite not giving you enough information, the movie respects the viewer enough to make those connections in the future, or review the source material to confirm your connections.</p><div class='title'><b>The Future of Dune</b></div><p>The end of Dune Part 1 is the most jarring part of the film. There's no real ending to the film at all. It just stops. I suppose this was alluded to at the beginning when the full title of the film "Dune Part 1" was revealed. It makes sense as this is a single part of an overall story, but it's still jarring. Dune Part 2 will continue directly where Part 1 ends. And I expect Dune Part 3 will be the conclusion of Paul Atreides story. </p><p>Denis Villeneuve has professed in interviews that he is a lifelong fan of Dune, and it has always been his dream to create a series of motion pictures that perfectly capture and encapsulate the story of Paul Atreides. I imagine that we will get a complete trilogy of Paul's story. But, the further story of his children may or may not be told.</p><p>I imagine that Villeneuve will probably move on to something else after three Dune films, but the greedy studio will push ahead with Children of Dune. I suppose that is our problem in the future to deal with.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dune_1/vlcsnap-2021-10-24-18h59m27s676_t.webp" /></p><p>I eagerly anticipate what will come in the future.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Edge of Tomorrow" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/edge-of-tomorrow">Edge of Tomorrow</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Ultimately, its low marketing budget and audience's saturation of mindless sci-fi action led to its poor box office returns, labeling it a bomb. But, this film is very underrated and under-appreciated, and it's a shame.</p><p>The overall story focuses on a single decisive battle between humanity against an invaded alien horde conquering most of Europe. Loss of this battle will result in the loss of the planet and life on Earth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h31m28s139_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tom Cruise is the star of the film, which both helps and hurts the film. One year prior, Tom Cruise starred in Oblivion, which wasn't that great. I think the reception of that film hurt this one quite a bit because people didn't want to see another stinker. At the time, I think Tom Cruise was seen as very humorless and self-serious because of viral clips online. But, his ideas created a lot of the humor and light-hearted situations in this film.</p><div class='title'><b>William Cage</b></div><p>Tom Cruise portrays William Cage, the head of an advertising firm forced to join humanity's army because of his ROTC training in college. He is a coward and does marketing in the guise of journalism for the army to sway humanity's trust into their war efforts. To avoid battle, at the beginning of the film, he tries to blackmail the leading general of the frontline to avoid going to combat. He's arrested and thrown into the army with the new recruits.</p><p>While training with the new recruits, he doesn't know how to operate his weapons, he tries to run away from battle, and tries to convince others to get him out. In the battle, he squadmates are killed by alien enemies, known as Mimics, while he avoids getting hurt. As a final act, before the enemy kills him, he grabs a claymore mine and sacrifices himself as he blows away the enemy towering over him. Dead.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-18h45m08s877_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cage awakes the previous morning, alive. The sergeant alive. His squad alive. He relives the same day again as it happened before. Once again, he's thrown into battle.

Her victory was the first time humanity had hope at actually defeating the enemy, so she became an symbol for the war effort.</p><p>Cage first meets Rita in battle on his first day, but she is immediately killed by incoming fire. So, on Cage's second day, he tries to save her, but he is killed.

The goal of this class is for students to become more familiar with listening to and speaking native English with correct feelings and expressions. The majority of the class focuses on listening. Students will get a script with various words missing from the dialogue. While listening and watching the scene, they'll fill in the blanks with what's missing. We'll also go through the meaning so students can keep up with the story.</p><p>These listening activities lead to Performance Tests. Rather than doing a final Listening Test for the unit, students will make pairs and perform a scene from the film. Students will not only memorize and say the correct dialogue, but must act the scene with correct expression and feelings with their voice, face, eyes, and body.</p><p>The first performance test is when Cage meets Rita on the battlefield after days of trying to save her. From his actions, she realizes and understands Cage's situation. She throws down her weapon, and exclaims, "Find me when you wake up." Cage confused by the response replies, "What?" Rita, one more time clearly orders, "Come find me when you wake up," and they're both killed by an explosion.</p><p>Because the dialogue is so short, students exchange roles. My grading mainly focuses on the student performing as Rita. Cage's response is important to support Rita's dialogue, but ultimately it's Rita's dialogue that is key to this scene. Students must make a distinction between how the dialogue is said first compared to the second time when it is so clear, without any misunderstanding.</p><p>Again, check the <a href="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow" title="/courses/edge-of-tomorrow">course page</a> for the full performance criteria, as well as worksheets.</p><div class='title'><b>Defeating the Mimics</b></div><p>Following orders, Cage ditches his squad during training to find Rita during her training. He tells her about what's happening, and she understands. She tells him that she used to have the power to reset time, and she used to win the battle at Verdun. She lost the battle when she was wounded and a medic transfused her blood.</p><p>Both of them go to meet Dr. Carter, played by Noah Taylor, a scientist who had previous helped Rita during the Battle of Verdun and understands how the Mimics operate. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h03m04s598_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Mimics operate as a single entity. The normal orange enemies are the Drones. They operate as an unthinking appendage of the horde. Killing them has no real effect. The larger blue enemies are the Alphas. These act as the enemy's eyes, ears, and nerves. When killed, an alpha sends a signal to the brain, which is called the Omega. When the Omega receives this signal, it restarts the day and corrects its course to victory.</p><p>On the first day, Cage killed an Alpha, but Cage was covered in the Alpha's blood. By absorbing the Alpha's blood, he also absorbed the Omega's power of resetting the day. When Cage dies, the Omega resets the day, and everything starts again.</p><p>To win the war, the Omega must be killed. Cage and Rita train together to make Cage mentally strong enough to kill the Mimics. Each day, Carter searches for the location of the Omega. As Carter gets closer to finding the Omega, Cage and Rita work on a strategy for plowing through the battlefield and reaching the location of the Omega.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h24m32s658_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Second Performance</b></div><p>After days and days of dying and little progress each day, Cage and Rita make it to a farmhouse miles inland from the battle.

The war is over.</p><p>Cage's dying body sinks to the smoldering core, and absorbs its blood.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-20h06m28s306_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Cage awakes, days before the final battle, in the helicopter leading him to the army command from the beginning of the film. With the enemy destroyed and inert, the war is over and the battle is no longer necessary. All of his squad members are alive having never entered battle. Rita, too. The film ends with Cage meeting Rita at the base.</p><div class='title'><b>Morals</b></div><p>There are several morals to be learned from the film that I like to imbue on students. The first moral or lesson is the importance of repetition and continuous efforts towards your goal. Winning the entire war seemed absolutely impossible at the beginning of the film, but it was through Cage's reluctant yet continuous efforts that he gained the confidence and knowledge needed to win.</p><p>Additionally, he was not successful on his first attempt or even his fiftieth attempt. Cage constantly experienced failure and learned from his failures every day to progress further and further to eventually achieve victory. These efforts ultimately rewarded him with the ability to know what to do in an unknown situation when he no longer had the ability to reset the day at the end.</p><p>Also, through all of his daily failures, he showed his bravery. In the beginning, he was a coward who would do anything to run away from battle and danger. But, even on his first day, he showed bravery by killing himself to destroy the Alpha. That small showing of bravery gave him this power, and each day he showed more bravery trying to save his squad mates, and save Rita, too.</p><p>One of the key quotes in the film is <b>"Battle is the Great Redeemer."</b> Battle shows a person who they truly are as they shed whatever person they were in society. Cage was ultimately victorious because, at heart, he was courageous and brave. When pushed to the ultimate limit, what kind of person are you, really?</p><p>All morals are important for life, and the film shows this through Cage's journey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/edge_of_tomorrow/vlcsnap-2021-10-04-19h51m58s178_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Original Script Ending</b></div><p>The finished film we received has a pretty happy ending overall, and doesn't necessarily play by its rules at the end. The whole film Cage always goes back to the base. But now, just to wrap everything up in a nice bow, he goes back to before he dishonored himself with the general, escaping punishment. His overall sacrifice ended up rewarding him with a happy ending.</p><p>The original script was not so kind. Leading to the final battle, it seemed like the Omega knew they were coming. One of Cage's squad mates even yells this out, "They know we're coming, man!" This is because, in the original script, in this battle previously, they had killed an Alpha. Killing an Alpha resets the day, but anyone outside of the Omega living that day wouldn't know it. </p><p>The Omega knows they are coming, and kills them all off one by one. The Mimics take over the Earth, and humanity is lost.</p><p>Tom Cruise and the production crew did not like this ending for several reasons. Thematically, it didn't really fit with the direction of the story towards the end. It didn't make sense for Cage to learn everything and grow, just to be killed in the end. Also, it wouldn't balance the overall feelings of the film. There are some comedic moments, but everything is so tense. There needs to be some relief. And, we've seen everyone die over and over again throughout the film that seeing more death wouldn't really have the weight to it.</p><p>I think they made the right choice.</p><div class='title'><b>Novel Differences and Ending</b></div><p>Edge of Tomorrow is adapted from a Japanese "light" novel entitled, <b>All You Need Is Kill</b>, by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. It has since been adapted to a manga, too. There are some key differences in the story that lead to a different ending than both movie versions. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/edge_of_tomorrow/all-you-need-is-kill-full_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The biggest overall difference in the story which leads to many other story differences is that there's a fourth Mimic type. In addition to Drones, Alphas, and the Omega, there are also <b>Antennas</b>. For every Alpha, there is an Antenna, and the Antennas receive the signals sent from the Alpha to trigger the Omega to restart the day. For Rita and Cage to destroy the Omega, they must first destroy all of the Antennas, and then the Omega.</p><p>In the end, Cage and Rita (actually his name isn't Cage in this, but it doesn't matter) eventually destroy every Antenna and land the final blow on the Omega. But, the day resets. Even killing all the Antenna didn't work. This was because an Antenna still existed.</p><p>Much like Edge of Tomorrow, Rita had previously gained the time power from fighting in Verdun. But, when she lost the power, she didn't lose it completely. She became an Antenna and Cage is her Alpha. All Antenna must be killed. So, after killing all other Antenna, Cage and Rita face each other, and Cage delivers the final blow. He then destroys the Omega, ending the war.</p><p>Out of the three endings, I like this one the best. Rita can finally make her sacrifice that she decided on earlier. She's able to join everyone who died with her at Verdun, and the rest of the world is able to survive the Mimic invasion.</p><div class='title'><b>Legacy</b></div><p>Even with these three endings, people online have come up with lots of other ideas for endings. Also, recently (2024), there have been talks with Tom Cruise and Warner Bros to make a possibly sequel. With such a happy ending, there is still room to have more time shenanigans. So, how will they continue the story? What could they do?</p><p>Concluding class, I ask students to come up with a premise for the sequel.</p><p>One of the more creative endings from fans was Cage still retaining the time power from the Omega. After living his life with Rita, Cage finally dies of old age. But then, he wakes up back at the beginning of the final battle only to live his life again. The film could revolve around Cage becoming a bit of a demigod with the time power warping him. Ultimately, Cage has to figure out how to truly die.</p><p>Overall, <b>Edge of Tomorrow</b> is an incredible film. It's one of my strongest classes that revolve around a film. There's so much good in the film. This post is pretty long, and I never even talked about <b>Bill Paxton's</b> incredible performance as Master Sergeant Ferill. </p><p>I already spoiled the whole movie, but if you've made it this far without seeing it, you've gotta see it.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Happy Death Day" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/happy-death-day">Happy Death Day</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 25, 2019 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Happy Death Day is a rare film that blends slasher horror, mystery, and comedy into a well-acted fun film that feels pretty standard or forgettable at first, but stays with you as a fun party movie or hangout movie.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h24m15s829_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Jessica Rothe</b> portrays Teresa Gelbman, or Tree, as she awakes in an unknown dorm room after a night of heavy drinking and partying. Carter, played by <b>Israel Broussard</b>, brought her here last night, and helps her out before she storms out of the building. Throughout the day, she continues to mean and rude to others, until she is ultimately murdered at night by someone in black with a Baby mask of the school's mascot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h35m46s813_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Teresa wakes up in the morning again, the same dorm room with Carter. She continues throughout the day as everything had happened before. By the end of the day, she changes her actions to avoid the situation that led to her death. But, she's murdered again in a different way by the same person.</p><p>Thus, the mystery and suspense continues in sometimes unexpected ways as Teresa stumbles into various death scenarios to ultimately find her killer.</p><div class='title'><b>High School Expression Class</b></div><p>Since 2019, I've been using this film in my 1st year Expression classes. This was actually the first film I decided to use, too. Despite being a horror film, it is PG-13. There's no blood or nudity, so it's a very school friendly film, besides the idea of suicide. Here are the full <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course contents</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h46m59s371_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Jessica Rothe is also really great in the film. She puts in all of her efforts in each of her scenes to bring out feelings of tension and mystery. Her acting is very expressive which makes it easy for students to understand her thoughts and feelings without necessarily understanding what is said. Broussard does a pretty good job with this, too, and complements Rothe together as Tree and Carter.</p><p>Another reason that I really like the film is the overall journey Teresa takes from beginning to end. Throughout her adventure, she's able to examine her life and understand how terrible she's been to others. By the end, she's changed into a better person.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-21h05m44s571_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the class ends, I mention to students that people often go through life working on one thing to the next without truly examining their life. It's important to think about the kind of person you really want to be, and think about what you can do for yourself and others around you to accomplish your goals and their goals, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Class Contents</b></div><p>You can view the whole list of course contents on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. After watching portions of the film, I have questions for students to answer about the contents. Or, we'll watch a particular scene again and again for listening. For questions, we'll watch the film with English subtitles. For listening, there are no subtitles. Sections of listening are often followed by double-checking the meaning of the dialogue.</p><p>The main fun of the course are the performance tests. Two students will make a pair and perform dialogue together. The full grading criteria is on the <a href="/courses/happy-death-day" title="/courses/happy-death-day">course page</a>. Grading for the performance test is based on the correctness of the spoken dialogue, the expressiveness, and also cooperation between both members because acting isn't something done alone.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-19h55m30s970_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first performance scene is about 25 minutes in the film between Tree and Lori. Tree has already been killed twice, so she confesses to Lori about what's going on and how she feels. Lori doesn't believe her. In the scene, one student is Tree, and one student is Lori. While performing the dialogue, they should correctly show these emotions through their voice, body movements, and facial movements.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h34m12s401_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The second performance test is way more intense. After dying 5 or 6 times, Tree is sent to hospital. The killer is there, too, but Tree escapes in Gregory's car. She's then pulled over and arrested on an empty highway. She thought she had gotten away, but the killer catches up with her and confronts her in the back of the police car. Through frustration, fear, and confusion, she snaps at the killer. "What do you want? Why are you doing this? Who are you?"</p><p>This is the performance. One student stands over the other, and Teresa says these words with passion and emotion. Then, they switch roles. I think it's easy for students to understand her frustration and fear, but students should really try to push their voices to match the emotion. Not too loud, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h54m17s824_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final performance is the opposite. After realizing her terrible behavior and how she has treated her father, Teresa finally meets him at the restaurant and apologizes. She holds his hands, and whole heartedly says, "I'm sorry" and "I love you."</p><p>In a pair, one student is Teresa and the other is the father. They hold hands, and one student expresses these words to the other. This isn't so easy to do. Eye Contact is important. Also, students should try to think of their own parents to correctly express their feelings. Pairs with friends or same gender is usually best for this.</p><div class='title'><b>The Ending and Sequel</b></div><p>Maybe it's not too difficult to figure out the identity of killer. Halfway through the class, I have students write down their thoughts of killer and write out two reasons why they think so. Some of them already have the right idea.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/happy_death_day/vlcsnap-2019-09-20-20h30m02s211_t.webp" /></a></p><p><i>Spoilers</i>, it's her roommate, Lori. I think their motive makes sense, and the opportunities for her to commit the murders makes sense. Some people online aren't so convinced and complain about it, but the movie doesn't take itself so seriously that everything has to make total sense.</p><p>There is an alternate ending where Gregory's wife, Stephanie, is the killer. I think her motive makes more sense, but her opportunities do not. Perhaps Stephanie and Lori working together would be best.</p><p>Either way, I feel like Happy Death Day never really got its chance to shine. Nobody really talks about this movie enough.</p><p>There is a sequel, <b>Happy Death Day 2U</b>, but the hard turn from horror into science fiction and a further lean into comedy, which is often too slapstick, probably turned off its audience. A third movie to complete the trilogy is set up at the end, but it was never given the green light. 2U came out in 2019, so the pandemic also helped killed the three-qual.</p><p>Both movies together are pretty fun, and definitely recommended.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Schlock" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/schlock">Schlock</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was 30 minutes long, and only showed movie trailers.  Mostly trailers for new movies, but some old ones, too.</p><p>One such episode featured a movie called Schlock<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhsR0hnyFVY</a></p><p>It was one of the most ridiculous, bizarre, hilarious-not-hilarious, trying-too-hard things I'd ever seen at that point.  Over the next few years, I searched around pawn stores, video stores, and old rental stores trying to find a copy of it on VHS, but it seemed like no one even heard of it.<br/>The name was pretty unique, so I used it as my screen name for AOL and everything else since.</p><p>In October 2001, it was finally released on DVD, and on my birthday that year, I was finally able to see it.  I had a bunch of people over to my dorm room, both friends from MN and college.</p><p>It didn't necessarily live up to my expectations, but I wasn't disappointed.  In fact, there were some pretty great moments in the film.  I don't really think any of my friends had quite the reactions I did.</p><p>For the last 17 years, the Schlock DVD had become quite scarce.  I think 10 years ago, the DVDs were going for the same price they are now, $150.</p><p>But now, once again in my birthday month, Schlock has been released again, now on Bluray, and in a rather nice package.  The booklet had a story about how John Landis scrapped together what he had to make it.  There's a reversible cover.  The movie is a 4k restoration.  There's a few commentary tracks.  New interviews.  Old TV spots, and other things.  It's the complete Schlock package.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/181030_schlock/IMG_7363_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's a week late, but now I have a new version of Schlock near my birthday, and new people to show this awful movie to.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Blade Runner 2049" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/blade-runner-2049">Blade Runner 2049</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 11, 2018 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Blade Runner 2049 was a very overwhelming film when I saw it the first time.  A lot of that came from the sound, music, and visuals.</p><p>The sound and music are very loud and unnerving.  It helps describe the enormity of the future and density of the city.  Much of the music drips of wet industry.  Loud sprawling flanges in wide shots.  Silence and subtle tones in movement.  The technology of the future feels organic and grown out of past that incorporated the technology into itself, rather than began anew.</p><p>The art design compliments the music well.  The future iterates on the future shown 30 years ago in the original Blade Runner.  Displays are blocky monitors rather than flashy holograms.  Communication is done through these displays, rather than a smartphone-like device that keeps constant communication between people.  The future also feels organic and lived-in.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner</b></div><p>The premise of Blade Runner is that a corporation has developed technology to essentially manufacture people.  Replicants are not mechanical robots or cyborgs or something like that.  They are a completely organic manufactured person.  Designed to be less emotional and strong, they are mainly used off-world as a physical workforce or soldiers or whatever dirty-work humans don’t want to do.</p><p>In the first film, replicants are Nexus-6 models made by the Tyrell Corporation and are illegal to bring to earth.  Blade Runners are a section of the police force to capture or take out rogue replicants that somehow get to earth.  The main plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard, a blade runner, as he tracks down 4 rogue Nexus-6 models that have come to Los Angeles.  One significant aspect of the Nexus-6 model is their 4 year lifespan, which was used as a security deterrent if they were ever lost or escaped.  </p><p>The secondary plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard’s relationship with Rachael, who is a prototype Nexus-7 model.  She was given memories and believes herself to be human.  The memories define her as a person, and as such cannot be easily detected as a replicant.  They’ve removed the lifespan limit as well.  The film also famously toys with the idea of whether or not Deckard himself is a Nexus-7 model, too.</p><p>As a result of the events of Blade Runner, the Nexus-6 models were deemed too unstable or uncontrollable for continued use, and Nexus-7 models never went to manufacturing and their designs lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Replicants in Blade Runner 2049</b></div><p>Nexus-8 models were quickly developed by the Tyrell Corporation and sent to market.  Models had registration numbers imprinted on their eyes, and records of all models were kept in a central database.  Replicants were easy to tell apart from humans.  But the public rejected them because of how violent and problematic the Nexus-6 models were.  Many models were hunted down and killed in the streets on Earth.  This led to the events described in the short film, Blackout 2022.  Two replicants successfully destroy the database and detonate an EMP above Los Angeles to erase all records of Nexus-8 models.</p><p>From that point on, replicants became strictly illegal.  All surviving Nexus-6 models died naturally.  Nexus-8 models went into hiding.  The Tyrell Corporation went out of business.</p><p>Over the next decade, the infrastructure of Earth begins to deteriorate with the loss of the replicant workforce.  There are not enough people to sustain the ecosystem.  Niander Wallace of the Wallace Corporation buys the Tyrell Corporation and begins developing the Nexus-9 model of replicants.  These models are have the same feature of the Nexus-8 models, but designed to be absolutely loyal.</p><p>In the short film, Nexus Dawn 2036, Niander Wallace brings his new Nexus-9 model before congress, states his claim that humanity needs replicants and that the replicant-ban be revoked, and then demonstrates their obedience.  Congress moves to revoke the ban, allowing Wallace to mass-produce Nexus-9 replicants and help rebuild the Earth’s environment.</p><p>In Blade Runner 2049, the main character is a Nexus-9 replicant, KD6-3.7, or "K" for short, played by Ryan Gosling.  He works for the LAPD as a Blade Runner tracking down remaining Nexus-8 models.</p><div class='title'><b>Cells Interlinked</b></div><p>To verify K’s operational stability, he is subject to a baseline recalibration test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h24m36s688.webp" /></p><p>The test asks him a series of questions followed by a word of phrase he is meant to repeat.  The replicant is not meant to think or respond to the question, only the subsequent phrase.</p><p>One of my favorite parts of the film is how K’s obedience gradually and subtly erodes over time.  Much like the test, within his police work, he is meant to avoid or deflect questions while getting answers.  Within his investigation and daily life, every question is a test.  In the beginning, he doesn’t waver.  Sapper asks him questions.  He ignored them.  Luv asks him questions.  He deflects.</p><p>Besides answering to his boss, played by Robin Wright, it’s only when Mackenzie Davis asks him a question, "What’s this?"  "A tree," that he responds directly to someone else’s question.  The first failure of the baseline test.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h56m20s593.webp" /></p><p>Later, he speaks with Robin Wright about the case and she asks him a direct question of the case, "What do these numbers mean?" or "Do these numbers mean anything to you?"  He replies, "No."  A lie.</p><p>As K continues to investigate the whereabouts of a replicant born into this world, rather than manufactured, and as he starts to believe that he is that child, he starts to question his obedience and loyalty.  In following scenes, his stern emotionless face begins to crack under the weight of his feelings.  Through his blank face, we can feel his sadness, frustration, and confusion.</p><p>Blade Runner 2049 follows K’s transformation from a mindless "robot" into someone fighting for himself and others and what he believes is the right course of action.</p><div class='title'><b>Imagery</b></div><p>Because the movie centers on K and his lack of emotion, so many scenes feel sterile and emotionally distant even though they are gorgeous.</p><p>I went through the film and picked out many images that shows the beauty of Blade Runner 2049’s art direction in set design, costume design, and visuals.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-11-15h13m00s018.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-15h39m23s386.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-18h53m40s177.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/blade_runner/vlcsnap-2018-02-18-22h10m46s956.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Denis Villeneuve</b></div><p>So, Blade Runner 2049 was definitely my favorite film of 2017.  It was directed by Denis Villeneuve, who directed my favorite film of 2016, too, <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.  Both movies were continuations and adaptations of previous works, but had a voice of their own, presented with a tense atmospheric soundtrack and beautiful visuals that engaged me completely.  I haven’t really seen any of his other films, but I’m definitely going to pay attention to whatever he does next.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Arrival" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/arrival">Arrival</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And through learning the language, her thought process changes, her perception of time begins to change, and she’s able to view parts of her future. Because she’s able to understand and process their language, she’s able to think like them and perceive time like them.</p><p>This is the central plot of the movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Human Examples</b></div><p>Let’s go back to our previous sentence, and compare it with some other languages.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.<br/>Je marche à l'école tous les jours.<br/>Yo camino a la escuela todos los dias.<br/>Ich gehe taglich zur Schule.</code></p><p>There’s English, French, Spanish, and German.  Each has its own sound and ring, but the basic sentence structure is the same.  I walk.  Je marche.  Yo camino.  Ich gehe.</p><p>The very first thing we care about in the sentence is "who" followed immediately by "what is he/she/it doing."  After that, everything else is details.</p><p>I think this is because our culture, personalities, and attitudes tend to be very direct.  Or we tend to favor people and ideas that are very direct.  If we can quickly and succinctly communicate the who/what and it’s action, we can understand the idea faster and fuller.</p><p>So, how does this compare with Japanese.</p><p><code><span class='ja'>私は毎日学校に歩いて行きます。</span></code></p><p>First is the subject (<span class='ja'>私</span> <i>watashi</i> or I), but the verb is the very last thing in the sentence (<span class='ja'>行きます</span> <i>ikimasu</i> go).  All of the other details are explained before the actual actions.  I think this is because Japanese language and culture tends to be indirect a lot of the time.</p><p>The Japanese teacher in class went on to give some examples of indirectness in Japanese, such as refusing an invitation.  In English, when refusing an invitation, we typically say something like, "Sorry, I can’t" or "I’m busy," and then maybe followed by a reason.  The refusal can be softer, but typically the first thing we say is very direct, "I can’t."</p><p>In Japanese, such directness could be considered rude or harsh, so the polite way to refuse is to be more indirect.  "Sorry.  On that day, I’ll be out of town"  or "Sorry, I already have another engagement on that day."  There’s no real reason to say "I can’t" because it’s implied, and because of that those harsh words are never said.</p><div class='title'><b>Switching Brains</b></div><p>As long as I’ve been learning Japanese, people have always mentioned the idea that they’re able to "switch their brain" when fully immersed in Japanese.  They claim they think in Japanese and speaking Japanese becomes more natural to them.  Sometimes they need to stop for a second to switch from talking in one language to the other.  </p><p>This idea is the foundation behind the plot of <b>Arrival</b>.  Louise can change switch her brain when communicating in the alien language, and then be able to perceive her current and future memories at a single time.</p><p>This has never been the case for me.  Over these last 4 years of living here, and 15 years since first learning Japanese, I’ve really just maintained a single mode of thought.  My thought process always tends to translate and interpret the incoming Japanese into something I can understand.  Outgoing, too, has a quick translation from English to Japanese.</p><p>Though, this single mode of thought has changed and been molded over time by all the language and culture I’ve absorbed and learned by living here.  For certain kinds of grammar and vocabulary, I can say them pretty fast.  It just feels more instinctual rather than a complete switch.  Through practice, I feel like I’ve simply trained my brain rather than developed something completely separate.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/film/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (23)
