The Writer's Guild of America's Contract ended on Halloween and without fair wages and proper benefits to renew their contract, they strike! Which means if this is not resolved in a timely matter, all our favorite shows will see some major hiatus.</p><p>As the article states, Late night shows will be the first to suffer and won't be seen tonight.  Sitcoms and Dramas, such as The Office, 30 Rock, and Heroes have roughly 5 unaired episodes at their disposal, which will keep the shows "new" until the end of November.</p><p>For Lost, lostpedia says that they are in the middle of filming episode 4 of season 4, but with plans to air the show without hiatus, we may see Lost season 4 a bit later than February next year.</p><p>Honestly though, this isn't so bad.  It'll give us a chance to wake up for our television coma, just as we did in the summer months.  We can go outside and enjoy the winter when TV runs out of TV at the end of November.  Plenty of time to start renting TV shows out on DVD.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688">Ain't it cool news</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Office tonight" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-office-tonight">The Office tonight</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 1, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Has Tonight's episode of NBC's smash hit The Office begun a story arc that will encompass the rest of the season and into the next.?  Now that they jumped the shark at the end of season 3, I was really wonder what they were going to do with the show..</p><div class='title'><b>Recap</b></div><p>Last season, everyone finally got what they wanted when after 3 season of tickling our assholes, Jim finally made a move to date Pam.  This story arc really began in Season 2 when Jim's feelings  surfaced episode after episode of awkwardness.  At the end Season 2, he finally told her about his love before she married Roy.</p><p>Jim saw this as his last opportunity to profess his feelings before taking a job in New York to get away from these feelings.  Season 3 began rather awkward focusing on Jim in the New York and the regular cast back in the Scranton branch.  Pam had called off the wedding and began searching for what she wanted.  While at the New York branch, Jim started dating fellow co-worker Karen..</p><p>Eventually these two branches became one and bits of drama began to ensue..  Now that Pam was free, it took all season for Jim to realize what he wanted was there, and that Karen was out of desperation.</p><p>6 weeks in, Karen has come back into the show and we find that she's a general manager of her own branch of Dunder Miflin.</p><div class='title'><b>Business Side of things</b></div><p>There are two points of business at work for this show..  There really is no overall story anymore with Jim and Pam together.  They tried to do something with Dwight and Angela, but their characters are as captivating as Jim and Pam.  The same with Michael and Jan.  These romances are more comical than real..  they have their moments, but not enough to carry the show.</p><p>At the same time, NBC's Thursday night line-up has a flat-tire at 8.30pm.  Scrubs is a funny show, but once you've seen a bunch of episodes, you've seen it all.  Except for story elements, you could watch a new episode and swear you've seen it before..  Scrubs will end in May 2008, so what the hell are they going to do to replace it?</p><p>News Article: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619">NBC developing The Office 2</a></p><p>It looks like The Office will be trailing The Office next fall in place of the Scrubs time slot..</p><div class='title'><b>Speculation?</b></div><p>With tonight's episode with Karen managing the Uttica branch of Dunder Miflin..  Is this the beginning of The Office 2?  Will this season start to tear apart itself after season 3 began stitching the cast back together at Scranton?</p><p>This doesn't sound like a particularly great idea..  The Office really works because of its great cast..  finding another cast as balanced and hilarious will not be easy..  I think it would have a LONG way to go without feeling like a complete ripoff.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Heroes Speculation" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/heroes-speculation">Heroes Speculation</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 30, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At the end of last night's episode Hero, the plot for the whole season seemed to emerge.  Especially with the trailer for the next episode.  Peter makes his way to Canada, finds stuff in the helix marked apartment and moves into the future with the irish girl.  They find themselves in downtown New York (against a green screen), where the streets are deserted and full of trash..  A slightly different apocolyptic vision than Hiro saw last season..</p><p>Hiro went into the future twice in season 1.  The first time was a glimpse of New York right before "the bomb" went off.  The second time was a few years after that with New York in ruins and the public going ape-shit after mutants.</p><p>The future that Peter has traveled to shows that by stopping "the bomb" last season, they did INDEED change the future.  I guess we already knew that, though..  The date and time of "the bomb's" explosion had already passed from what it should have been.</p><p>Peter picks up a piece of paper that reads "Evacution, June 2008", which puts them near the date of the final episode of Season 2.  The trailer goes on to say that 93% of the population was killed by a virus.. Most likely, the very virus Mohinder and Bob were talking about earlier to reverse mutants back into normal humans.  Looks like, in the future, Mohinder has failed in suspressing the company from making a virus/vacine..</p><p>It seems like they're following the same pattern from last season.  Catching a glimspe into the future reveals a catastrophic event only they can stop.  Save the cheerleader, Save the world..  what's the tagline going to be this time?  Stop the company, Save the world?  Stop parker's father, save the world?</p><p>I wonder when the first hiatus is....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freaks and Geeks further thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">Freaks and Geeks further thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 28, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After purchasing the Freaks and Geeks box set on Friday, I've really binged on the show.  Between Friday and Saturday morning, I watched the first 3 of the DVDs, totaling 9 episodes, an hour each.  Saturday night, I watched the next 2 DVDs by myself, and now I'm down to one remaining.</p><p>The more you get into this show, the formula really begins to set in.  I think the best way to describe this show is a mix between an after-school special, That 70s Show, and the Wonder years.  Most of the geeky jokes in the movie are really time centric with taking place in 1980.  A star wars reference here..  a star trek reference there..  Dallas, Welcome back Cotter..  It's the same formula that That 70s Show did until it began focusing on the characters.</p><p>This show has really begun to depress me, so I'm not really sure why I decided to binge on another six episodes..  I guess I couldn't stay away..  I think I'm going to lock up those final 3 episodes to watch them later on in the future.  How fitting that these final 3 episodes were never aired until ABC family picked up the syndication rights..</p><p>My old Madison roommates are somewhat on the same mind, but with Knocked Up, inside of Freaks and Geeks.  One of them relates to that movie with the same disdain because that was a life he almost lead.  The same feelings of entrapment and solid future were those he couldn't handle.</p><div class='title'><b>Suburbia</b></div><p>Freaks and Geeks really reminds me of the first Richard Linklater movie I saw..  Suburbia.  The first time I saw this movie, I was in awe with its realism.  Much like Freaks and Geeks, It really stuck with me for the next couple of days.</p><p>I've only seen it once, so I'm somewhat hazy on what point in time it takes place.  It was the last night in early September before all these high school friends went to college, the army, and another had a record deal.  This was the last day of their lives as citizen of their suburban town before they ventured into the world.  I think the year was 1985, or something like that.</p><p>Since it was their last night, they went through a wide range of emotions..  celebration, excitement, fear, loss..  pre-mature homesickness..  Their venture into the unknown..  A world outside theiir own.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>I saw this movie when I was a sophomore or junior in high school, so I viewed it as the same sort of fears I was supposed to have once I finished high school..  except I had no clue what the hell I was going to do at the time.</p><p>I was somewhat excited for this moment to happen for me..  To be at that point of no return with my high school friends, say goodbye for the final time and really feel for each other..  That never came for me..  Really, It was only until the end of last year and leaving Japan that I had that moment..  A conversation that ended on the tone that I would never see you again and I'm glad I met you...</p><p>That moment was real..  The moment was heartfelt..  With all my other friends in Japan..  I just turn on my computer and they're all on Instant Messenger..  but with that one person and that one moment.  It was the edge of the universe..</p><div class='title'><b>Scanner Darkly</b></div><p>Out of all other Linklater's movies, Scanner Darkly is the only other one that scratches at my emotions on some level.  There's only a few scenes that convey that slice of life feel, but I see myself in them none-the-less.  I think I'll leave it at that though...</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Now that I've seen Freaks and Geeks, I must see Undeclared.  I must see Judd Apatow's second building block of his cast of social rejects..  but, I really don't want to buy it.  I love Freaks and Geeks, but I probably could have gotten away with just borrowing it from someone..  I'll probably watch it again with someone who hasn't seen it, but never on my own.</p><p>There are a bunch of other TV shows I'd like to see too, like My So Called Life (as recommended by Erika), Californication, Weeds, Carnivale...  I'd also like to pick up where I left off with Six Feet Under (even though, Matt says the rest is dull).</p><p>Soooo....  maybe I'll start up a netflix account.  After comparing Blockbuster online versus Netflix, I think I'll definitely go with Netflix.  If Blockbuster had a video game service mixed in with DVDs, then there'd be no contest, but they don't.  And with their prices exactly the same, It really comes down to selection and with more Television shows, Anime, and obscure foreign movies Netflix has Blockbuster beat. Also, If I miss an episode of Heroes, I can watch it from netflix.com rather than nbc's crappy browser player.</p><p>I wonder how long it would take to get Undeclared disc 1 if I signed up now....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Freaks and Geeks" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks">Freaks and Geeks</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 27, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, I picked up the boxset of Freaks and Geeks, which contains all 18 episodes of the short-lived series.  I've so many things about this show and after watching Knocked Up and Superbad, I was really excited for it.  We watched about 6 or 7 episodes last night, and watched the remainder of the third disc this morning.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I really thought this show was going to be much more of a comedy than a drama.  I figured it was more on the lines of Undeclared, but I was way off.  I also thought each episode was going to be 30 minutes, but I was off on that too.  There's a lot more to this show than I expected which really through me back..</p><p>Freaks and Geeks is about freaks and geeks..  Set in 1980, it centers on Sam Weir, a freshmen high school who fails into the geek category of the show.  And centers on Lindsey Weir who is a junior or senior at the same high school.  She rejects her 'braininess' and wants to hang out with the 'cool' kids.. the 'freaks' category, which would be burnouts.</p><p>This show is incredible.  It is incredibly real and way too accurate that it's almost too much for me.  Freaks and Geeks fills me with so much sentiment, nostalgia, and memories of my own life in high school.  Good times, Bad times..  It's not like watching Back to the Future for the first time in 10 years and thinking back to the first time you saw this masterpiece..  It's living your life again..  too many social cares..  rejection..  affliation..  acceptance..  It's like watching a home movie of your life at age 14.</p><p>This slice of life is too big for me to handle..  It's really not a case of whether I like this show or not..  I feel like this show is me..  It's too good..  which is why it was cancelled. :/</p><p>I'll probably watch the rest of it tonight and tomorrow.</p><div class='title'><b>Judd Appatow</b></div><p>After Freaks and Geeks was cancelled, Judd Apatow (co-creator) went with a more comedic approach to the 'Freaks and Geeks' feel..  Undeclared was his next show, which featured 'Freaks and Geeks' in college.  Jocks became Frat boys..  Cheerleaders became Sorority girls..  but the social outcasts, where still outcasts.</p><p>It premiered on Fox, which probably doomed the show from the start.  It also only lasted one season.  I only remember seeing part of an episode, but I don't really remember it.  From what I remember, this is way more lighthearted than Freaks and Geeks.</p><p>Apparently, Judd Apatow has three other unaired television series that seem similar.  "Life on Parole", "North Hollywood", and "Sick in the Head".  Pilots were created for these three series, but they were very aired.</p><p>I guess the average TV viewer and Judd Apatow don't mix.  It's a damn shame though..  As far as popularity though, Apatow really struck it rich in the movies..  He hung with Will Ferril for a bit, and produced Anchorman, Kicking & Screaming (will ferril's crappy soccer movie), and Talladega Nights.</p><p>But his real talent lies in bringing slices of life into the theater..  He still comes back to the 'Freaks and Geeks' social groups, and made 3 movies in different points in time.  At the age 40 timeline, there's 40 year old virgin.  At the age 23-25 timeline, there's knocked up.  And at the age 18 timeline, there's Superbad.  You may not be the main characters in these movies, but chances are there's a character you relate to.</p><p>Another interesting fact is that Seth Rogen is in all 5 of Apatow's "slice of life" dramedies, and also several other actors and actresses as well.  Judd Apatow really doesn't give much direction when working with his talents, he produces these movies highlighting his talent's natural persona and let's them go loose.</p><div class='title'><b>Six Degrees of Separation</b></div><p>Besides Seth Rogen, Apatow reuses a lot of the talent that has been in his properties, and even the talent themselves have appeared in other films and TV together..  maybe its because when someone makes a geeky or burnout movie, these guys are the best candidates?  maybe its coincidence..?  fate..?  or perhaps they just like each ^_^.</p><p>I made <a href="/pages/apatow.html" title="/pages/apatow.html">a page</a> with all these social links.  Thank you, IMDB.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Journeyman, new on NBC" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/journeyman-new-on-nbc">Journeyman, new on NBC</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Headed back from the conference on Monday Night, I sat next to a fellow on the bus that was an avid Heroes fan. In fact, I had completely forgot that Heroes was on that night being immersed in all things Adobe. After we shared opinions on the show, he asked how I liked the show that trailed afterward, <b>Journeyman</b>.</p><p>I had completely written off this show. I wasn't interested at all, but what did peek my interest when he described it as "Quantum Leap done right".. Now that's a bold statement. Quantum Leap is one of those classic Sci Fi shows that everyone can enjoy, so adding a derogatory statement to push your show... well, that's something a fan would take issue with.</p><p>Anyways, since it trails Heroes and this guy seemed to think it was pretty bad ass, I thought I'd give it a chance. So, as I caught up with Heroes today, I decided to catch myself up with Journeyman as well.</p><div class='title'><b>What is it?</b></div><p>Journeyman follows Dan Vassar, a San Franciscan journalistic with a decent life, a great wife Katie, a son Nate. He also has a brother, Jack Vassar, who's a police detective. Part of Dan's past is revealed right away.. apparently his ex-fiance, Livia, had died in a plane crash 9 years ago.</p><p>Dan finds himself flipping back and forth through time without reason. One day, he's taking a cab ride and suddenly finds himself back in time 20 years. He flips back and forth a couple times with a common thread between each jump.. a man named Neil Stratos (or something like that). One a jump is complete, he's brought back to his current time a day or two after his disappearance.</p><p>These jumps are not explained what-so-ever. One second he's walking along the street and Dan's head begins to pound. The headache triggers something that shoots him back in time and there you have it.</p><p>So far each episode has centered on a single person that Dan did not know prior and that he must help for the good of humanity. Sounds like the exact plot of Quantum Leap, eh?</p><p>Throughout these time jumps, he runs into little pieces of his past. He accidentally meets the past version of this ex-fiance a couple times, but then he runs into the present version of Livia. It seems that Livia is also a time-traveler.. she doesn't know what's going on either, but she has some tips for Dan. She is kinda Scott Bakula's Dean Stockwell for the moment.</p><div class='title'><b>Modern Quantum Leap</b></div><p>It certainly has the concept of Quantum Leap down, but much has changed. This time-traveling craziness really screws up his marriage, his job. This isn't Science trying to fix the past for the good of humanity, this is a typical normal guy that finds himself mixed up in this time travel business. He has just as many questions as the viewer does.</p><p>It has a very dramatized modern feel to it compared to the kooky Sci Fi bender of the early 90s. But the rules are a bit different. As stated above, he's accidentally flying through time, so he has to pick up a couple time-traveling survival tips.. like using a cellular phone from the mid-90s, not using our current US currency (like those new $20 bills), and so forth.</p><p>Also, unlike Quantum Leap, Dan does not switch places with a patron of the past. He disappears from one time and appears in the other. Compensation of matter is not even discussed in the show, but it's only been two episodes. The big mystery at the moment is both why is and how does Dan travel through time.</p><div class='title'><b>Faulty</b></div><p>This show would be fine except it's not really that great. Journeyman is a drama, before it's a sci fi show. I'm sure that follows from its creator Kevin Falls, known for the West Wing. Since it's a drama, it takes itself very seriously and provides very subtle humor, rather than more blatant stuff like in Heroes.</p><p>Journeyman doesn't compensate for this at all.. The writers try to make things interesting by making his wife, his brother, and his boss all pissed off at him for disappearing. Well sure, I'd be pissed off if my husband disappeared for 2 days without warning, but it doesn't make for good TV.</p><p>Dan really isn't all that funny either. You'd think the stuff would try to take the light-side of accidental time travel and what not, but NO.. Dan is a very stern stoic fellow that will do what needs to be done. Not that interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Worth watching?</b></div><p>I dunno.. After watching the first two episodes, I thought the show was somewhat interesting, but if they want to stay on the air, they will need to move the plotline of the show very quickly or else people will just stop watching. Overall, I'm not itching to see episode 3, but I will. I'll continue to invest my time in the show, but I don't see it paying off.</p><p>Who knows though.. surprises are good ^_^ Maybe he'll go back in time to stop his show from being canceled.</p><p>This is not Quantum Leap done right, Quantum Leap is Quantum Leap done right.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tear Jerkers" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tear-jerkers">Tear Jerkers</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

A movie that can be engaging, can be captivating, and overall you emotionally invest yourself in from the start.  Whether, you love the characters, love the environment, love the music or any other part of it, you are brought into the world with such force that you tune out everything else.  This movie (or game) becomes part of you.</p><p>With such beauty it brings itself to the absolute climax and you are there riding along side it..  You are there with the characters, with the scene as it unfolds.  and BAM.. it hits you.  That feeling of absolute beauty.  So much beauty fills you.. overflows through you..  so much so, that can't help but shed a tear.</p><p>Pure Happiness ^_^</p><p>That's how I feel every time I watch <b>Princess Mononoke</b>.  That's how I feel when Ashitaka and San return the head to the Dear God, he revives himself, and then falls to his death..  At that split moment, when all the destruction, all the hate, and all the war is whisked away into the air..  The peaceful, raped, and bare land lays still..  until the buds of life begin to grow.  The brown scorched hills begin to breathe green from its soil, as the piano solo starts..</p><p>:sniff:..  it's so beautiful..</p><p>It's hard to hold back your emotions when you realize that life does move on..  With all the sadness, anger, and horror, life will always prevail.</p><p>Oddly enough, wasn't it a decade ago when it first came out in theaters?  :looks it up: .. nope, I'm wrong.  It came out in October 1999 in US theaters.  Heh, that was a good movie date..  I went with both Michelle and Lindsey (co-workers at Toys R Us) to Plymouth Manns theater the day it came out.  However, it did release in Japanese theaters in July of 1997.</p><p>Hopefully, whomever holds the North American rights will release a Blu-ray version of Mononoke in the near future.</p><p>Anyways, aside from <b>Princess Mononoke</b>, there is one other movie that captivates me with so much emotion..  and that is <b>Garden State</b>.  I should really buy myself a copy of that movie.  That's the one with Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.  I think there may have been others, but i cannot recall.</p><p>Excellent movies..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Recent Movies" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/recent-movies">Recent Movies</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This summer has been pretty kickass for movies.  In fact, I don't think there's been a summer where I've gone out and seen so many movies.  Transformers, The Simpsons, Superpad, Bourne Ultimatum, Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix, Spiderman 3, Live Free or Die Hard..  All of them entertaining, and some pretty good.</p><p>There are two other movies I've seen this summer which are also pretty good, but not as widely talked about as these big Blockbusters..</p><p><b>The Invasion</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>This past weekend, when I was back home in Minneapolis my little brother and I caught The Invasion, starring Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  The Invasion is about an alien invasion on earth based off of the novel Body Snatchers, and somewhat of a remake of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Nicole Kidman is a now divorced single mom who is loosely dating Daniel Craig, when the invasion begins.  They try to survive, all while solving the key to defeating the aliens.</p><p>The Invasion is the most passive alien invasion I have ever witnessed in film.  These aliens are micro-organisms which infect humans by mutating nerve cells.  Once the individual falls asleep, the organisms take advantage of our involuntary glandular sweating to transform us from who we were, into their completely controlled slaves.  We're still who we are.. we're just controlled by them.</p><p>The first hour of the movie is their subtle take-over of humanity.  Once the main characters figure out what's going on, it's too late and it becomes a race for survival.  Nicole Kidman's son is immune to their advances and Nicole Kidman must retrieve him and bring him to the resistance to develop a cure.  But, she's been infected and must keep herself from falling asleep and turning into a slave.</p><p>The Invasion is very intense.  It's a lot like a zombie movie..  the fear of being discovered while hiding from the zombies.  the intense action of running away from zombies.  The Invasion ends strong, but begins very weak.  It's not the best movie in the world, but for some reason..  it really sticks with me.  Probably because i really like Daniel Craig and Nicole Kidman.  Plus, some the zombie/aliens are quite creepy and spooky.. like that little Asian kid.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion:</em></b> Anywho, catch it out, if you're so inclined.  It's not half bad..</p><p><b>Stardust</b> <em>Spoilers</em></p><p>Stardust is a fantasy fairy-tale written by Neil Gaiman.  I saw this about a week ago down in Rockford with Erika and Stephen.</p><p>Stardust's main hero is a boy named Tristan and his story of becoming a man.  He lives in a little english town called Wall, which is bordered by a wall that humans must never pass through.  Beyond the wall lies the fairy-tale kingdom of Stormhold, where, this very day, the King lie on his death bed.  Stormhold has a tradition that only a solitary living heir may ascend the throne..  which is a problem since 4 sons still live.  As the king, played by Peter O'Toole, draws his finally breath..  the one to ascend the throne will turn his now diamond pendent back into a Ruby.</p><p>Ok, I'm going to stop right here and not give away the entire movie.  Suffice to say, a star falls to earth which Tristan wishes to capture for his "true love".  But the witch wished to possess this star for immortality.  The ruby knocked the star out of the sky, so the Star has the Pendant on her.  Everyone is after the Star, which Tristan finds first.</p><p>This movie is quite a gem.  It features several all-star actors, Peter O'Toole, Michele Pfeiffer, Claire Daines, Robert De Niro, and Ian McKellen..</p><p>Stardust reminds me a lot of Princess Bride.  It's completely ridiculous and never takes itself seriously, but still retains a serious plot and presents a wonderful tale of love and adventure.  There were times I smacked myself on the head because it was so dumb, but also warmed my heart at the cutesy scenes.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think it'll reach the cult star power that Princess Bride has these days, but it might if the proper crowd gets a hold of it.</p><p><b><em>Non-spoiler opinion: </em></b> Definitely check it out. ^_^  Great date movie.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 21, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dexter is a television program on Showtime.  Dexter, played by Michael C. Hall of Six Feet Under fame, is a serial killer.  His victims happen to be other serial killer and murderers.  This is the way he balances out his serial killer need for bloodshed while performing acts of good.  A vigilante at night, but a forensics officer during the day, solving crimes and misdeeds of bloodshed and foreplay.  One job helps facilitate the other.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 1</b></div><p>However, Dexter's word is turned upside down with the emergence of a true rival.  A serial killer with true value of cleanliness, precision, and love towards his killing methods.  This killer leaves hints for Dexter.  Plays with Dexter.  Looks for a friend in Dexter.  and Dexter finds a playmate in him.</p><p>Dexter is a wonderfully crafted, suspenseful show that will leave you wanting more and more.  I was first recommended to watch this show when I returned from Japan and visited Platteville for the first time.  Matt, Dave, Jamie and Tony were all in agreement that I needed to see this..  but I was busy dealing with the depression of being back in the states.  Luckily, when I visited Justin in North Carolina he was of the same opinion, sat me down with Showtime on Demand, and let me be.</p><p>Season 1 just came out today on DVD, and I definitely recommend this show to those who haven't seen it.  Unlike those arrogantly priced HBO series, Showtime has priced Dexter Season 1 at $40 MSRP..  but you can pick it up all 12 episodes of season 1 for $30 at Best Buy this week.</p><div class='title'><b>Showtime v. HBO</b></div><p>Showtime is really pushing the public towards this show, it seems.  Now that HBO is basically dead, and half a million subscribers canceled their service because Sopranos is now done, Showtime sees this as its chance to pull in as many of that audience as possible.  Dexter is a strong strong show.</p><p>Hell, we almost switched over to Showtime from HBO because of the Sopranos and Dexter, but ended up just quitting HBO.  Sorry, but John from Cincinnati is ass.</p><p>These real high profile pay-channel TV programs really start off strong, for the most part.  Sopranos Season 1 and 2 were amazing, but then began to wither in Season 3.  Six Feet Under Seasons 1 and 2 were equally amazing, but again.. lost all steam in Season 3.  Deadwood didn't keep it's amazing quality past Season 1.  Season 2 killed it.  And Now John from Cincinnati can't even start up strong.</p><p>Season 1 of Dexter was quit well done, despite a couple stereotypical drama-like plot devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Season 2</b></div><p>Episodes 1 and 2 of Dexter Season 2 have been "leaked" on the Internet.  I just finished watching them and this show really raised the bar.  I can't wait for episode 3...  which'll be in the second week of October :/</p><p>I use the term "leaked" loosely because if I were Showtime, I would send out the first episode or two to generate even more buzz on the show.  I mean, I want to see Season 2 now more than ever thanks to that 2 hour teaser.  It makes decent sense.</p><p>The first two episodes work very well with each other and tie up most of the stuff brought up in this episodes.</p><div class='title'><b>Anywho..</b></div><p>Definitely great stuff..  But, Rent or Netflix Dexter Season 1 today.  ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Fall Season" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-fall-season">The Fall Season</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 12, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The summer is a great time of the year.  It's nice outside and the general media actual promotes the activity of going outside by not airing anything good on TV (except for the Sopranos finale).  I've had a great time, actually..  Disc golfing, relaxing, spelunking.  But as the summer begins its downward spiral post-climax, it's also great to look forward to TV again.  and why not?  TV is actually starting to get good again, in general.  When does everything begin?  Let's see here...</p><p>Monday, <b>September 24th</b> - NBC - <b>Heroes</b> Season 2 Premiere<br/>Thursday, <b>September 27th</b> - NBC - <b>The Office</b> Season 4 Premiere<br/>Sunday, <b>September 30th</b> - SHO - <b>Dexter</b> Season 2 Permiere<br/>Thursday, <b>October 4th</b> - NBC - <b>30 Rock</b> Season 2 Premiere</p><p>All four of these shows have their previous season DVD box set releasing in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>August 21st - Dexter Season 1<br/>August 28th - Heroes Season 1<br/>September 4th - The Office Season 3<br/>September 4th - 30 Rock Season 1</p><p>The Dexter box-set is crazy cheap on Amazon, so i pre-ordered that one, but I think i'll pass on the other box sets. Unfortunately, both <b>LOST</b> and <b>Sarah Connor Chronicles</b> begin airing in Feb 2008, so the waits continues :/</p><p>__</p><p>In other completely un-related news, I cut my hair a little bit on Thursday.  I sliced off a whole 3 or 4 inches on my general length.  I must say, it feels quite nice.  You'd think shortening my hair a mere 8 or 10% wouldn't make much of a difference, but it feels more manageable.  That's probably more a result of having even ends, though.</p><p>It feels good.  I should have trimmed my hair a while ago.  The last time sheers had touched my auburn locks was well over 4 years ago..  maybe closer to 5, actually.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/film/6">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/film/4">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
