It feels rather weird though..  this whole Season kinda felt like not much has happened (up until the last 4 episodes), but the show has come a long way since last year.  We know many of the Others, have seen all the Dharma stations, and know what happened to the Dharma Initiative.  We also know who's been getting busy with each other on the Island, and Locke has become a badass again.</p><p>And what the hell is up with Mikhail..  he gets the shit kicked out of him every single episode he's on, and has even died twice, but still comes out okay the next episode.  I think the writers took a page out of South Park for this guy.  Maybe the name Mikhail is the Russian equivalent of Kenny.</p><p>Anywho, Now that all of my TV shows have completed until Fall, it's time to go outside and frolic in the bask of Summer.  Or (something i'll probably do) watch all the episodes of Lost again from the very beginning by showing them to new people.</p><div class='title'><b>In the News</b></div><p>As stated yesterday, only 3 seasons remain with 16 episodes each.  The next episode of Lost will air in February of 2008, though.  The tiny 4 month Season 4 should end around this time next year.  So the timeline of episodes is probably something like this:</p><p>Season 4: Feb 2008 - May 2008<br/>Season 5: Feb 2009 - May 2009<br/>Season 6: Feb 2010 - May 2010</p><p>Also: I will buy <a href="http://abctvstore.seenon.com/detail.php?p=18265&v=lost" title="http://abctvstore.seenon.com/detail.php?p=18265&v=lost">these</a> once they have all eight stations included.

| May 22, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last night, was the ending of Heroes Vol. 1 and I'm not really sure how i feel about the ending.</p><p>One can't simply watch Heroes and not compare it to Lost, being it the other prime time networked Sci-Fi show.  Lost does a lot of things that really keep me watching, but others constantly complain about.  Lost is all about compounding mystery and never really giving the audience any specific closure.  The writers allow the audience to build up theories and speculate about the show's direction, so the mystery will always be there.  Specifically with the way they end a Season.  Each season constantly builds up to a massive climax where the audience isn't given enough information to solve a mystery, but ends in such a way where the first 4 or 5 episodes of the next season undoubtedly will.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b><br/>For example, at the end of Season 1, no mystery was really solved, but there was closure on the current events.  Sayid and Charlie dispelled the Other's incoming attack, while Jack, Locke, Kate, and Hurley blew open the Hatch and while Sawyer, Jin and Michael were blown into the Ocean.  The biggest mystery of Season 1 became the main focus of Season 2: The Hatch.  The first 3 or 4 episodes finally gave the audience what they wanted throughout Season 1 and the rest of the Season compounded the mystery.</em></p><p><em>The same happened with the end of Season 2.  Well, i suppose one very large mystery was solved at that time: "What would happen if the counter went past 0?"  Also, we learned why/how the plane crashed on the Island.  Season 2 was kinda at odds with itself, since it juggled two mysteries at once.  The ending of season 2 gave closure to Hatch, while climaxing on the Others.  I suppose another mystery solved was the identity of Henry Gale.</em></p><p><em>Anyways, the point is that the Season 2 ender setup Season 3 to give the audience what the wanted with the Others.  Even though, they spread out the answers across the entire Season.</em></p><p><em>The same will true with tomorrow night's Season 3 finale.  All current events will be resolved, and a 'larger' mystery will show itself to be the focus of Season 4.  What could it be?  I think Jacob or something involving Jacob will be the focus of Season 4, while half-way through the Season, 'The Rescue' will start showing its face and probably be the focus of Season 5, with Season 6 something to do with Dharma.</em></p><p><em>If I were to name the seasons, I would name season 1: the crash, season 2: the hatch, and season 3: the others.  perhaps season 4 will be 'the island', season 5: the rescue, and so on.</em></p><p>Anyways, the reason I bring up Lost is that the Season ender gives the audience something to look forward to.  It ends on a cliffhanger that makes the audience squirm.  Heroes did not do that last night, in my opinion.  The whole season led up to Peter and Sylar fighting and the writers gave them exactly that.  The battle to save the world and enough of the aftermath to bring the audience back down from their high.  Volume 1 is closed.</p><p>The only cliffhanger the audience was given was the first 5 minutes of Volume 2, with Hiro back in time when the eclipse happened.  That's not what i care about at the moment.  I cared about Sylar fighting Peter, and stopping the bomb..  but all that is done with now.  I can't get attached to a story element in Season 2 when i've only been given 5 minutes of it.</p><p>The ending also eluded to Sylar being alive, and I'm sure Peter is still alive as well.  If Season 2 focuses on this, it'll just be Season 1 all over again.</p><p>So, yes..  I don't really know how i feel about it, because on one hand: i was given exactly what i wanted, but on the other: now what do i look forward to.  Lost gets it in this department..  even though, so many people complain about it.</p><p>So that's how i feel about that.  I can't wait for the finale of Lost tomorrow. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>In the News</b></div><p>Lost will be a total of 6 Seasons with the remaining 3 seasons only 16 episodes each, as opposed to 24 episodes.  Each episode will air consecutively.</p><p>Heroes will be back with 24 episodes, and a companion 6 episode series entitled Origins.  Each episode of Origins will focus on a single New character that might be brought into the main show.</p><p>In an interview with the creator of Heroes, he states that he wanted to make the cast of each Season as independent from each other as possible.  Originally, he was planning on killing off almost all of the current cast, with only 2 or 3 continuing characters into Season 2.  Season 2 would feature an almost entirely new cast.  He changed his mind after the audience really responded to the current set of characters.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, it makes sense to give that much closure to Season 1.  Then you can begin anew.</p><p>(sorry.. i don't have sources, at the moment, for these 3 tidbits)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost - Purgatory" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-purgatory">Lost - Purgatory</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 3, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><em>Lost Spoilers ahead</em></p><p>Last night's episode of Lost put a solid structure on one of those internet theories about the Island.  This theory states pretty much exactly what has been said in the last two episodes that "all the 'survivors' of 815 actually died in the crash and the island is Purgatory."  Naomi confirms this by saying that in the real world they found Oceanic flight 815 at the bottom of the ocean, in tact, with all passengers in tact and very dead.  Locke's father also says the same thing.</p><p>Lets examine everyone else's back story of how they got to the island.  Naomi's helicopter just crashed in the sea, Desmond was thrown overboard in a violent storm, Juliet drank some unknown substance given to her, Locke's father was smashed into a median, Danielle's research ship crashed on the island.  Perhaps they did all die, and this is the gateway to the afterlife.  Perhaps their actions on this island will determine where they spend enternity.  The island follows a similar construct to life, but with a few changes.  If you die on the island, do you go to hell or heaven?  Is the island itself Heaven, considering the others are a group of "good" people.  Since Ben is their leader, does that make him God, or Jesus?  Or is the Island hell, as Locke's father puts it, which would make Ben Satan or some devil?</p><p>I guess this explains why the others kidnap certain people.  They are separate the bad ones from the good ones..  The heaven candidates from the hell candidates.</p><p>Does this make the big bad black cloud of smoke the Reaper? Does that make the sonic fence the divide between heaven and hell?<br/>The whole thing with the babies also promotes this theory.  Life cannot be conceived on the Island, because everyone is already dead.  I guess the writers believe that Life begin at conception.  This is why Claire's baby is fine, and why all the other mothers die before the baby is born.</p><p>However, this whole "island = purgatory/afterlife" debate has a couple holes in it.  What about Michael?  If this is the afterlife, where did Ben send Michael?  To be reborn?  To heaven?  Or to wake up from purgatory back in the real world?  What about Ethan?  If he can leave the island to the real world and recruit people like Juliet, what does that make him?  An angel?</p><p>How do the numbers play into this theory?</p><p>The end of the season should be interesting.. even though this concept is very Twilight Zone-esq.  The really hasn't been a lot of build up, but it seems like the other's incoming attack on the survivor's camp with be the climax.  Along with whatever Jack knows.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to McFarlane Lost Toys" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mcfarlane-lost-toys">McFarlane Lost Toys</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 29, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>i was browsing 4chan today and came across several threads about tonight's episode of LOST.  One the posts was some comment about how they brought back all the characters that have died into all the flashbacks, but the photo for the post was a figure of Artz.  It looked like any 'ol crappy action figure, but it was still a LOST figure.  How awesome would it be to get a Jack figure and have him yelling at the Locke figure for a couple seasons or two..  Kickass awesome, that's how awesome.</p><p>I hopped on google and typed in 'lost figures' and what i found was far more than i bargained for.  Apparently McFarlane Toys picked up the rights for LOST figures.  Collecting McFarlane Toys had been one of my favorite hobbies back in high school and art college..  allow me to elaborate:</p><div class='title'><b>Back in the day...</b></div><p>I think i've always been a collector at heart.  I started off on baseball cards and garbage pal kids cards, like most kids growing up in the 80s.  I didn't really have a ton of money, so cards were really the perfect fit.  I could easily spare $1 or 2 after school to hit my local Ben Franklin (now turned into John's Variety and Pets).  Collecting cards really began the whole aspiration to completing something.  Acquiring an entire set of a specific item of this world.  Striving for completion.  Finishing what you started, and searching wide and far to accomplish your goal.  etc, etc, etc.</p><p>With collecting anything, you began to acquire a lot of excess that you don't really care about.  You usually become caught in the moment that you gloss over the fact that most things are a waste of money.  Oh well.. I'm American and this is how our country works.</p><p>Anyways, in high school i began working at Toys R Us, and lemme tell you.  Giving a kid an income at store that sells things intended for short-term entertainment value will start eating away at said income, unless they have a strong will, very good tastes, sensibility towards money or simply realize that toys are really a huge waste of money that companies make a huge premium because they are cheap pieces of crap.  Thankfully, at the time, i was in the mindset that toys are cheap pieces of crap.</p><p>However, that changed when i ran across my first glimpse of McFarlane figures.</p><div class='title'><b>Todd's Toys / McFarlane Toys</b></div><p>We had a few aisles of action figures at Toys R Us: mostly 7c and 8c though.  Most action figures are cheap pieces of crap.  They were army figures that stood straight and stoic, horribly painted, and solid colored accessories.  They were wrestling figures that all had the same body, slightly changed outfits by color or paint jobs only, and faces that looked nothing like the actual wrestler.  They were movie figures that also looked nothing like the actual actor, had no consistency of size between different movie franchises, and usually came with so many extra accessories that were never actually featured in the movie.</p><p>In a neatly straighten, plastic garden sea of mediocrity, McFarlane toys blew everything out of the water.  The first figures i laid eyes on were Spawn series 6 and 7.  These figures looked beautiful.  Faces actually had discernible features, clothing actually looked soft and flowing like real clothing, the color used represented earth tones normally found in actual human clothing.  It looked like someone ACTUALLY spent time and care making these figures, rather than just pumping out something for kids to buy.</p><p>The beauty of the figures were only matched by the medium.  You had Alien Spawn with a dark dimly painted body, wrapped in tentacles.  The Freak had actual hair, a famished physique, and baggy pants.  Each figure in this set looked drastically different than the next.  Each figure had a different posture, different build, different color, different head.</p><p>I fell in love ^_^</p><p>As new series came out, each figure became darker looking, darker colored, and more dramatic poses.  When the Spawn movie was released in the theaters, i caught the 'making of' special on the Sci Fi channel.  Todd talked about the movie, and in the last segment he talked about the figures.  During this time, he went through the process of creating his figures, and his vision of what his figures should be.</p><p>He said that he would tell his assistants that once they finished painting a figure and they think they had it just right, throw it on the ground.  "Kick it around in the dust and dirt and completely soil your paint job...  Then it'll look exactly how i want it."  He want on to explain, "These figures are representative of some happy love story environment..  These are characters in a dark, dirty world with corruption, sleaze, and villainy.  They should not only look the part, but feel it."  This is the love that goes into McFarlane Toys.</p><div class='title'><b>Coming of Age..</b></div><p>Todd really loves his toys.  He brought his comic book (Spawn) to life within his figures, and made them in his own vision.  In 1997 and 1998, He began to branch out and do this with other properties as well.  He branched to video games with his Metal Gear Solid figures, movies with Austin Powers and his Movie Maniacs series, and into music with The Beatles Yellow Submarine and Kiss.  He began making figures of his favorite franchises in the way he wanted them to look.</p><p>This move was business genius.  His figures know grabbed the attention of a much wider audience and was able to boost sales considerably.  Though, i like to think he was still making figures for himself.  This next move was proof of that.</p><p>In the year 2000, his figures branched into another one of his favorite hobbies: Baseball and other sports.  After buying Mark Mcguire's final homerun baseball of that season, he released his Baseball, Hockey and Football figures.  Again, he began making the figures he wanted, while making yet another genius business move.  Sales climbed exponentially, as he continued to release more figures.  I mean, who the hell wouldn't want a beautifully action posed 6 inch figure of their favorite sports star.</p><p>This was about the time i quit Toys R Us, i moved out of state to Wisconsin when i wanted a new start at college, rather than finishing art school.  Since i was no longer in direct contact with McFarlane figures, and didn't have that first contact with a new shipment of figures, I began to loose touch.  I checked spawn.com every now and then, but i really didn't have a community of spawn figure collectors to talk with or gain knowledge from..  so touch was lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Collecting the figures.</b></div><p>When it came to actually buying figures, a figure had to meet 1 of 2 criteria: rare or awesome.  I usually picked up the rare figure in each new series unless i just didn't like it, but whenever i came across a figure that looked awesome, i picked up that one as well, despite rarity...  hell, that's the reason you buy action figures in the first place.</p><p>McFarlane figures were always distributed to be collected.  Most figure series had 6 figures and came in a case of 12, which generally contained 2 or 3 of each common figure, and then one figure of the series intentionally distributed to be rare.  There will always be one figure that comes 1 per case, and usually it's the most scantly clad female figure of the group, or the most kickass figure of the group.</p><p>To further the collectability scheme, each series generally had 'first edition' figures.  These were figures first off the production line.  They were inspected and sometimes changed slightly, to fix errors or just improve upon.  Then the actual production of the figures commenced.  At Toys R Us we usually got a case or two of these first edition figures.  Months after the line had been in the market, McFarlane would go back and repaint this series in all new colors, and then release them again.  Generally, any given series of McFarlane figures had at least 3 separate versions of a single figure.</p><p>First editions usually don't go for too much more than regular editions.  Some of the time they are seriously flawed, which is why they were changed.  This is especially the case with one of my favorite figures: Manga Spawn from Spawn series 10.  Manga Spawn has a chain that goes from one hip bone to the other.  The first editions had a plastic chain, with huge chain links.  It looked gawd awful.  The regular version featured a metallic chain like a necklace, with tiny links and a gold shimmer.</p><p>The rare figures are always worth more, and can sometimes be next to impossible to find for an older series.  When McFarlane got the rights to the Matrix Reloaded/Revolution toys.  Each case of 20 figures, contained only one of 2 twins.  Prices for these figures immediately shut up to $35 each, and continued to climb.  They are pretty cheap these days, though.  $20 each on ebay, right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Through the dormant years</b></div><p>These past years, i've rarely glanced at spawn.com to see what has come out.  Honestly, my primary collecting efforts have turned to video games.  But whenever i find myself at a Toys R Us, i make sure to check out their figures.  Toys R Us has the best assortment of McFarlane Toys, and if you visit one less traveled, you can usually find the rare figures easily.</p><p>I have 4 personal favorites that i've collected over the years, in order of release: <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802">Manga Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793">Mandarin Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138">Wings of Redemption Spawn</a>, and <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519">Gunslinger Spawn</a>.  I would gladly take photos, if i actually had them here with me, but they are at home, displayed on my other shelves.</p><p>One of my favorite figures he has made that i do not own is <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844">Armchair Morpheus</a> from Matrix figure series 2.  Though, it looks pretty cheap on ebay. Also, i missed out on <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658">Mandarin Spawn 2</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>Anyways, Back to Today, McFarlane has the rights to produce figures of LOST and they look amazing.  Series 1 of the LOST figures came out November 2006, and feature Charlie, Locke, Jack, Kate, Shannon, and Hurley as regular figures, plus the deluxe boxset of the Hatch.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318</a></p><p>Like all McFarlane figures, they look simply amazing.  Of course, these photos are of the original sculpture by Todd McFarlane, and are then used to create the mold.  The final figures are based off this mold, so the most dynamic curves will smooth out a tad, and the paint job will be just a little more efficient too.</p><p>Out of series 1, the Locke figure is striking, but i think the best figure is definitely Charlie.  I would actually open that one in put it on my desk, window sill, or shelf.  I might open up the Locke figure, depending on how it actually looks.  They actually come in boxes, so the can be resealed rather easily without damaging the packaging.  huzzah.  I bet Shannon's figure is the rare one of the set.  Though, they should've made a figure of her getting shot.  I think that would've been more meaningful.</p><p>Upon further inspection, series 2 of LOST figures are released in July 2007.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346</a></p><p>Jin's figure is pretty awesome, but overall rather bland.  The other figures are the same..  What's up with the Sun figure, though?  Is that really the most representative pose for her from LOST?  hmmm..  i suppose that was the episode where she was finally able to be free from Jin's suppression.</p><p>ahh... sweet sweet consumerism.  hmm.  After all this reminiscing i forgot all about those crappy LOST figures.</p><p><b>Edit:</b> Whooo.. i picked up The Hatch Playset at Toys R Us yesterday.  It was clearanced down to $15, so i could not say No.  I was rather surprised that $15 was the same price as the individual figures though.  Quite Pricey.  They were completely sold out of the Locke figure, had plenty of Charlie figures, and equal amounts of the other figures.  It would seem rarity is based on popularity this time, unless Locke is the intentionally rare figure of the set.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 300" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/300">300</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, my roommates and i all had premiere tickets for the new action-packed Frank Miller comic-book adaptation, <em>300</em> in fitchburg's Imax theater.  300 is about 300 spartans against the invasion of the Persian empire.</p><p>Visually this movie is absolutely stunning.  Few movies have such a rich quality of picture that literally any screen shot is a vivid photo suitable for framing.  It does borrow some special effects from Sin City, where eyes and other light elements of silhouettes are illuminated..  Such as the Persian soldier's eyes as they crept over the hills.</p><p>300 is one of those movies where i have certain expectations coming into the film.  Ya know, i've seen trailers and heard about the story, and all this stuff.  I hype myself up, and when i exit the theaters.. i feel disappointed.  Like the movie totally missed the mark for me.  This is happened with a couple other movies, such as Matrix Reloaded and Scanner Darkly.</p><p>Afterwards, i get home... go to bed..  Throughout the night and the next day, i keep thinking about it more and more, and start appreciating the movie for what it is.. not what i thought or someone else thought it was supposed to be.  You can't judge some romance movie because it didn't have enough action, or comedy because it didn't have enough serious moments..  I don't really know what i was expecting 300 to be, but it stands on its own.</p><p>The movie is pretty much all action and sex and action.  Battles are waged constantly, and the battle scenes are brutally raw and bloody.  I don't think i've ever seen a movie with so much blood, yet not really consider it to be gore.  Blood flies everywhere during most scenes, but it is shed in such a violent and deliberate way..  The blood is almost a living form within the shots.</p><p>As a whole, much like the battle scenes, 300 is terrifically raw.  Half naked muscle man, stumping across the battle field, beating, and stabbing and thrusting spears into each other, yelling at the top of your lungs.  Not to mention other scenes, with naked women telling the future, and seducing the gimp, and being naked.</p><p>This movie screams Man.  It's almost as manly as ripping off your chest hair, or smashing your head into the hood of a car, or other manly feats as scene on that Snicker's superbowl commercial.  It makes you want to join in the action, and scream your head off..  "SPARTANS!" in all of your awesome glory.  Pick up a spear and join the fight.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to War of the Worlds" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/war-of-the-worlds">War of the Worlds</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday we watched one of my favorite movies..  <b>War of the Worlds</b>.  Man i love this movie.  That 2005 Friday evening was a very magic evening.  Nature truly applauded the release with a lightning storm of its own.  That summer i went to the theaters a total of 3 times to see it.  Later on, i downloaded it from the internet and watched it quite a bit more.</p><p>I hadn't seen it in a while, so i needed my fix.  War of the Worlds falls into the same category as other great films like Matrix Reloaded, where the movie itself is very shallow.  It won't win any awards, but there are many aspects of the movie that are rich in substance.</p><p>I really seem to like these movies.  They appeal to my manic adrenaline side, but still offer more than that outside of the film.  I think that's why i don't really like Crank all that much.  There's really nothing there..</p><p>One of the things i noticed about War of the Worlds were the death machine designs compared to the alien design.  The aliens themselves, are 3 legged creatures with 3 fingers on each hand.  They can also walk on walls, which suggests the tip of their fingers have suction cups or something like that.  Their torso's are quite small compared to their leg span.  They have tiny little arms, and their heads fan out kinda like a spoiler.</p><p>The death machines can be described in the exact same way.  3-legged machines with tiny bodies.  Small little arm instruments on that body with a fanned out head..  So these alien death machines are actually alien mecha, machines built in their creator's own image.  Much like how anime such as Gundam model their massive machine after the human body.  It interesting to see a alien race so bent on vengence and rage would adopt one of our most arrogant traits.  It's quite... human.</p><p>When i was in Japan, #five and i got onto this subject somehow and he was telling me about an article some guy wrote about the movie.  It dealt with the time periods in which these movies were made.  For the original War of the Worlds books and movies, it was always about the aliens coming to air.  Flying their air ships from the sky, and zapping all the humans.  All those remakes came at a time when war was waged between countries.  The threat was always external.  Fear of invasion.</p><p>In the new War of the Worlds, the aliens were always here.  Underneath us..  biding their time.  They didn't come from the outside.  This parallels the wars that are waged today.  The war with terrorism.  The threat isn't external: it is internal.</p><p>This really makes the 2005 War of the Worlds an <em>adaption</em>, not a remake. ^_^</p><p>____</p><p>Anywho, this movie is all manor of kick ass, so if you haven't seen it you must.  I was rather surprised that one of my roommates hadn't even heard of it..  That was actually the real reason behind watching it.</p><p>A while ago, i developed the War of the Worlds drinking game which is both simple and works quite well.  All you have to do is take a drink when:</p><p>1) Someone asks an unanswered question.</p><p>That's it.  It worked quite well on Niehaus the first night he decided to drink.  I've got pictures hidden around this site if you're interested ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Crank" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/crank">Crank</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 4, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>yesterday, i finally got the privilege of watching one of the fall lineups grandest movies: <b>Crank</b>.  Crank stars action-star Jason Statham as a double-crossed hitman.  He's been poisoned and must keep his adrenaline up, or else his heart stops.  The first time i heard of such a movie i thought it was one of the greatest movie concepts i had ever heard.  Over-the-top Action after over-the-top action after over-the-top action.</p><p>And that's exactly what this movie is.  Statham just beats the shit out of so many people, it's ridiculous.  Almost every scene he is in has some element of violence or drugs which fuels the over all adrenaline rush of the movie.  There's a few scenes where he's going through the hospital looking for epinephrine, and randomly pushing over patients for no reason..</p><p>This movie has a sense of humor in that way, but it also knows when it's being retarded.  The first action sequence of the movie features Statham driving through a mall, which is COMPLETE RIPOFF of Blues Brothers, which we just so happened to watch the other day.  The writers knew they were ripping it off, and made sure the audience knew this by adding in the line from Statham, "there sure are a lot shops in this mall."</p><p>It's also rather funny how there is no sense of boundaries at all.  Statham does drug after drug after drug, steals police cars, breaks things.  It's like they put everything bad that some irrate mother would complain about, they put it in and flaunted it.  It's kinda like Grand Theft Auto the movie, but not a movie about the story of GTA, just when you go around killing people and stealing cars for no reason.</p><p>This movie has everything i could've hoped for, but i find difficulty liking it.  It's so fricken Spike TV...  but that's what makes the movie so kickass.  Action, Action, Action for those with no attention span.  this attitude lends itself so well to the movie, since the main characters can't stop at all to figure out what's going on.  He's gotta get revenge before he dies, and if he stops....  Game Over.</p><p>The movie also has no shame when it comes to product placement. Need Adrenaline? Red Bull, Rockstar, and plenty other energy drinks and in there.  You could also say Cocaine, Pot and Nasal Spray fall under the category of product placement too.</p><p>Anywho... i suppose if you haven't seen Crank, you should definately give it a go.  Especially if you think over-the-top action movies are hilarious because the movie does go out of its way several times for a gimmick.  But as for owning it?..  eh..  maybe for the purposes of showing it to others.</p><p>Unfortunately i haven't seen either Transporter movies, so i can't really compare it to those.  For some reason, i have the feeling they are pretty similar to this.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to V for Vendetta" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/v-for-vendetta">V for Vendetta</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Film classes need to put down there pencils and pile into the theaters right this very moment in order to learn and feel what it is to make a movie.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers have done it again.</p><p>I think we have ourselves a movie of the year here. Is there any of other movie that could really compare to the magnitude of V for Vendetta. This movie is beyond powerful. It's as if the Wachowski Brothers harnessed pure energy at a neutronic level and simply shaped it into film.</p><p>is it possible for the Wachowski Brothers to actually make a bad movie? i mean, really? It's like asking if an Italian could make a bad pizza.</p><p>People need to give these guys more money because they honestly deserve it. I just emailed them my bank account numbers. You should too!</p><div class='title'><b>V for Violence</b></div><p>This is where the film clearly shines as the main character using his Matrix style moves to kill people. Slow motion is used to detail the knives as the glisfully float through the air into their victims.</p><p>It's a form of art really.</p><p>The Wachowski Brothers must have some sort of extra sensory vision in order to visualize the impact of each individual knife and then clearly transfer this thought process into film.</p><p>It's like the Wachowski Brothers are god except there are two of them. Oh man, what if they really were god. Who knows how are universe would have been shaped and created if the Wachowski Brothers made it. Two half gods are better than one?</p><div class='title'><b>V for.. Five?</b></div><p>V is not actually for Vendetta, it's for the roman numeral Five. He named himself this as his was in the fifth room of this detention facility. #Five you have a kindred spirit.</p><p>beyond that, five is a very powerful number. It's the third smallest prime number. It's the only prime number to end in the digit 5. It takes place in the fibonacci sequence.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of sides in a Pentagon. What could this mean? The whole movie is about government rule and such. Perhaps the Wachowski Brothers are trying to tell us something with our own government in this movie.</p><p>5 also refers to the amount of points in a Star and 5 Stars refers to the rating system most movies are judged upon.</p><div class='title'><b>V for Victory</b></div><p>This film is positively amazing and i would see it over and over again if i had the time.</p><p>19 1/2 thumbs up.  all the way.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Equilibrium" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/equilibrium">Equilibrium</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I got to Batman Begins somehow, and from there went to Christian Bale to check out his movies.  Besides the movie listing, there was a picture of him from the movie Equilibrium, a movie that i have never heard of, so i checked it out.</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/Equilibrium_DVD.webp" /></p><p>The description compared it to the Matrix and Brave New World, says that it was a futuristic thriller where society is the enemy.  This sounded pretty good, so i went out to Best Buy and picked up a copy.</p><p>Bad Move.</p><p>While Equilibrium sounds pretty good on the surface, i was quite disappointed with the results.  All the promo's on the DVD jacket stated that it's gun fighting techniques were top-notch, however in execution, the were too over-the-top, set to horrible background music, and just looked goofy.  This movie prides itself on it's gun fighting, but there's not enough of it, and it's awkward in execution.</p><p>The story of Equilibrium is set in the future, when society has developed a drug to supress emotions in humans, since emotions are what triggers conflict, war, etc.  Society has a team of police that hunt down anyone not taking the drug, and they also destroy anything that has to do with emotion.  The future is completely black and white.  Sounds pretty pretentious.</p><p>What was really disappointing was the acting.  or perhaps it was acted so well, that Christian Bale perfectly executed the dull process of a emotion-less tool into a senseful human.  Christian Bale himself is pretty emotionless in his acting in the first place..  perhaps he wasn't the best choice.</p><p>Christian Bale is an interesting fellow, though.  I hardly EVER hear about him at all, yet he has a little cult following known as Bale-heads.  He's extremely buff yet acts in B movies, aside from Batman Begins.  American Psycho was the only other movie i remember him being in that i have actually seen, and ever then i didn't ever know his name.</p><p>anyways..  the story was par, i'd say.  there were too many plot twists at the end that made it unbelievable, not that the story wasn't pretty far-fetched in the first place.</p><p>I really should have rented this movie if i wanted to see it..  oops.  It puzzled me why there wasn't a copy at any of the used movie stores i went to, and i have come to the conclusion that no one bought the movie in the first place..  They must have rented it instead.</p><p>Though i still kinda like Christian Bale, i think i'll check out <b>The Machinist</b> next.  apparently, in preparation for the movie he lost 63 pounds to fit the role, and then after shooting he gained it back for the Buffed up Bruce Wayne.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Ring impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ring-impressions">The Ring impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 28, 2002 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Artist Interpretation? or Hollywood at its worst?</p><p>The Ring is an excellent delve into a Horrific Mystery. Fear and anxiety plague the main character, Rachael, as she finds out what madness she has come across. The scenes of her investigation are excellent pieces of art. A red leafed tree, across the landscape of endless fields. As the sun sets behind the tree, it appears as if on fire. The redness of the leaves burn through the sun, reddening its shadows.</p><p>As time grows deeper into the film, the trauma and disorientation felt by Rachael is shown through the degration of colors. Once a vibrant woman of color, now the film shows her in an unsaturated state along with the rest of the scene. As the darkness becomes her, the film becomes dirtier, and the mystery develops onward.</p><p>But let's face the reality of the movie. Despite all the beautifully shown imagery and wonderful plotline of events, this movie is a remake. A remake of the original Japanese movie directed by Hideo Nakata, which was a film interpretation from a line of novels writen by Keiji Suzuki.</p><p>My first reaction to this movie praised its originality, but Hollywood fuckin' ripped off the original artist of all his visions and made it their own. In fact, one of the head producers of Dreamworks said, "We were frightened and mesmerized by it, and immediately decided we were going to remake this movie."</p><p>What audacity do we have as americans to think once we find some obscure piece of art that we must make it own just because we saw it first. Almost all of us think this way. I must own it. It must be mine. Such selfish uncreative feelings.</p><p>And besides that, the Japanese film spun its own amount of sequels and prequels and side stories. The Japanese cashed in on the product as well. Is there nothing original in this world that doesn't end with big money? It never stops.</p><p>And besides all this uncreativity, the new version of The Ring rarely has any good acting. The lead role does a fine job, but all the other characters are below par. The first 30 minutes of the film is straight out of any late 90s horror film. The dialogue and scenes feel taken almost directly from Scream. The whole phone ringing, and false alarms. How predictable can you get??</p><p>I was going to say this movie was quite amazing, but after finding how far the roots admittingly go, there's not an original idea in this movie at all.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/film/7">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/film/5">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
