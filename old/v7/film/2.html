In the documentary, they evade police and security officials to set up several cameras hidden in the woods, underwater, and up on the nearby cliffs.  Spoilers!  In the end, they are able to capture the footage they want, and use the footage against those denying this thing happens.</p><p>I think it's a pretty powerful movie.  I've never quite been able to enjoy zoos or aquariums quite in the same way after seeing this movie.  It exposes the cruel environments many of the animals are held in, and why it's so damaging to them.</p><div class='title'><b>The Name</b></div><p>Why is this called The Cove?  The dolphin slaughter takes place in a very convenient natural inset away from the beach, and main road of the town.

All other hiking paths that have clear vantage points can be controlled as well.  The sea can also be easily controlled as the area is constantly used by fisherman, and the town's establishment.  Everyone knows everyone, so if any unidentified boats approach the area, they are easily spotted, and monitored.</p><div class='title'><b>The Actual Cove</b></div><p>Here is the actual place.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5823_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5823_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5823_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5823_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5823_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The cove is located on the side of road just a few hundreds meters down the road from the whale museum.  There's a small police station across from the cove overlooking the area.  The beach itself is completely open, and you can walk down to the rocks.</p><p>The gathering and killing of dolphins doesn't happen until September, so the area was deserted.

I went to the north of the cove, and climbed up those trails.  These lead behind the whale museum.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5877_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5877_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5877_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5877_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5877_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As the path reached the cliffs above the cove, the edges were roped off with trespassing signs.  "Keep out!  Unauthorized access is prohibited!"  The ropes and signs lined the entire length of the trail once it got high enough, trying to prevent anyone from getting a good vantage point on the cove beneath.</p><p>I continued up the trail, which lead to an open park area.  From here, I went through the exit on the other side.  This trail went down the cliffs on the ocean side.  From there I could travel back along the coast and peer at the cove.  But, I was met with another gate.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5896.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5896.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5896_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5896_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5896_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Still not really feeling ambitious, I turned around.  In the park area, there was another trail that led up above the trees.  Back in the day, this was probably a location for a lighthouse, or some kind of observation building for the area.</p><p>From here, you could see a lot of the beautiful ocean, and the rocky shards piercing its surface and into the sky.  Much of Taiji's beaches were filled with these sharp rocks, which can provide some natural shelter and obstacles for fish and other sea creatures against the fishing boats.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Unfortunately, the trees and forests obscured a decent view of the cove.</p><p>I descended and returned to the street.

Just some ropes and tarps.</p><p>After that, I basically gave up.  I could've went around to the other sides of trails, but I figured I would continue running into more gates, and turn around.  Thinking about it now, I probably should've tried coming up from the south and gotten above the cove, or come around the other side.  I probably should've tried going over one of these gates to see how far I could get, but I didn't feel like being a foreigner <span class='ja'>外人</span>.</p><div class='title'><b>Killing at The Cove</b></div><p>In the film, they are able to put their cameras in perfect locations, and film the killing.

After the lack of direction nor interesting characters in Season 5, we were mostly turned off from the series.  But we picked it up, watched it, and glad we did. :)</p><div class='title'><b><em>Spoilers!</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Season Arcs</b></div><p>I think the reason Season 6 pretty well is that we have an actual fleshed out character as a villain with clear motivation, and actually does plenty of murder throughout the Season.  Seasons 1 and 4 did this perfectly and stand as the best two seasons of the show.  Seasons 2, 3, and 5 strayed away from this and fall very flat as a consequence.</p><p>I think that Season 2 had a pretty tight focus, but the villain was basically Dexter.  Unless you count Lyla, but she wasn't a serial killer at all.  She's just a crazy bitch, which was more of a manifestation of Dexter's dark side.  I think that the suspense of Dexter being caught makes up for the lack of a strong villain, but there still isn't a whole lot of murder going on.</p><p>Season 3 is the absolute worse.  We do have a serial murderer, but he has no character at all.  They never wrote him that way.  He's just a dude who skins people.  Who is he?  I dunno.  Jimmy Smitts as the Season's actual villain, but he's not really a serial killer.  He's just a controlling asshole, and the whole season focuses on that.  Who cares?  Get to the killing.</p><p>Season 4 felt incredibly fresh after the horror of Season 3.  Dexter is out killing again, and his kills actually show his character, and he grows.  I wrote about all that while the season first aired: <a href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4" title="/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">October 20th, 2009</a>.  But we have a clear villain, who does a lot of murder.  Dexter learns from the clues and tracks him down, while the police are closing in as well.  And there's an epic showdown.</p><p>With the story they had laid out for Season 5, I think it was doomed for failure.  They had to deal with the aftermath of Season 4, while still spinning their own plot.  Well, they couldn't just focus on grief the entire season, so they needed to throw a villain in their, too, somehow.  And maybe a love plot, too?  Whatever...  This season focused more on Season 4, rather than itself, and suffered because of it.</p><p>With Season 6, they were able to start fresh.  A brand new villain, with a clear motive, and their story focused on throughout the season.  It was fantastic.</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>I think they learned from Season 4 a little too much.  If you end with a massive cliffhanger, you instantly pull in the audience and make them care far more than the normally would.  I'm guessing that Season 5 Episode 1 had the highest amount of ratings of any single Dexter episode thanks to the ending of Season 4.  And I expect Season 7 Episode 1 to pull in some serious ratings as well.</p><p>Currently, Dexter is signed on through Season 8.  I expect them to actually finish off the show at Season 8, but who knows what'll happen.</p><p>Also, I expect Season 7 to be somewhat similar to Season 5, but perhaps with a Season 2 edge.  It won't be as sappy, or mistake ridden as Season 5 because Dexter isn't some vulnerable lost sheep.  But the writers still have to deal with the aftermath.  In Season 5, they wrote out almost everything that had to do with Rita, Aster, and Cody, and just moved forward.</p><p>I don't think they can ignore Deb, but I wouldn't put it past them to write her as understanding and accepting.  Which is the complete opposite of what she would actually do.  They have a chance to actually end on a high note, and write an interesting drama filled plot between these two characters, but I fully expect them to fuck it up.</p><p>Who knows...  In any case, I'm fully invested in this show again thanks to Season 6. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 13 Assassins (2010)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/13-assassins-2010">13 Assassins (2010)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's a remake of a classic 1960s film of the same name, and by famed director Takashi Miike, who has also done Osaka Tough Guys, Ichi the Killer, Audition, and many many more.  It seems like the guy does 3 or 4 movies a year.</p><p>The setting is in the mid 1800s as the feudal shogunate system was beginning to fail.  Samurai were losing their social power, and the Shogun were desperately trying to keep their ultimate power, while peasants were dying from starvation.</p><p>Lord Naratsugu was son of the Shogun, and committed horrible crimes against the people he reined over.  Killing entire families for fun, disemboweling women, and leaving them to die.  There was nothing legal to be done, so samurai Shinzaemon was summoned and ordered to kill him by a rival political party, before Naratsugu can gain more political power.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>Shinzaemon recruits 12 others, mostly samurai, and forces Naratsugu into a battle as he returns home from Edo.  Shinzaemon cuts off several routes, and lures Naratsugu caravan into a small rustic town, where the battle commences.</p><p>The setup, tone, and execution is very much like Seven Samurai.  The first half of the movie is recruiting and setting up the battle, while the second half is the entire battle itself.  13 Assassins pays great homage to Seven Samurai with the added benefit of being historical significant.  In Seven Samurai, the samurai simply protect a village against bandits.  In 13 Assassins, it's common Japanese samurai taking down the Shogun's son.</p><p>The greatest part of this movie is the very end when Shinzaemon and Naratsugu are set to battle each other, and Shinzaemon stabs Naratsugu through the gut with his Katana.  Naratsugu falls to the ground in pain, and suddenly realizes that he's not a god.  He's not some divine creature born to rule mortal men.  He IS a mortal man.  And now he's dying in a ditch, like a mortal man.</p><div class='title'><b>End Spoilers</b></div><p>I haven't seen the original, but Takashi Miike's 2010 adaption of 13 Assassin's is absolutely top notch.  It's one of the best Japanese films I've seen in a while.  And people seem to agree as it has a 95% on Rotten Tomatos, and won the award for Best Film from the Japanese Academy Awards.</p><p>You guys should definitely check this out.  It's on Netflix Instant Watch right now!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Adventures in Tron" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/adventures-in-tron">Adventures in Tron</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 31, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past Thursday, I was lucky enough to grab two tickets to an early screening of 20 minutes of the upcoming <b>Tron Legacy</b> film.  Despite being billed as "Tron Night", it really was just 20 minutes of the film.  They showed 5 scenes from the first half of the movie, and finished off with an extended trailer.</p><p>I'll describe each of the scenes, but first I'll refresh everyone's memory on what happened in the first movie.  I just finished watching it a minute ago, so it's all fresh in my mind.  Then I'll get into the new movie.</p><p><b>Tron</b> </p><p>(Spoilers from Tron 1)</p><p>First off, there's <b>Kevin Flynn</b>, as played by Jeff Bridges.  He's the most notable and iconographic character in the Tron universe.  In <b>Tron</b>, Kevin Flynn is a genious video game designer working for ENCOM.  All of his work was stolen by <b>Edward Dillinger</b>, played by David Warner.  Dillinger took all the credit of Flynn's genious, and quickly rose the ranks to a top executive position.</p><p>Meanwhile, Flynn hides out in his arcade.  Many of the games produced by ENCOM line his walls.  After hours, he relentlessly hacks ENCOM's server to find definite evidence of Dilliger's misdeeds.</p><p>The fantasy world inside the computer represents programs as their human users.  Flynn's program is named CLU.  In the first couple scenes of Tron, CLU is captured by security drones and erased by <b>Master Control</b>, locking Flynn out of the ENCOM mainframe.</p><p>Master Control Program is that spinny red cylinder face guy.  MCP is an artificial intelligence set to control most of the company's assets.  When Dillinger tries to take control back from MCP, MCP backmails him into complying.</p><p>Anyways, destroying CLU also locks out <b>Alan Bradley</b>, whose program is named Tron.  Tron is a security protocol set to monitor and regulate Master Control.   There's also a girl named <b>Lora Baines</b>, who works on a laser that dematerializing objects into the mainframe.  Why?  I dunno.</p><p>So, Alan and Lora run off to Flynn's Arcade to warm him that ENCOM has found out about his hacks, and they all hatch a plan to break into the ENCOM building and hack the servers from inside.  Alan goes back to his cubical and waits for communication from Tron, while Lora escorts Flynn to her laser lab to use her computer.  Lora runs off somewhere, and Flynn starts hacking away at the mainframe to find the evidence.  Meanwhile, MCP notices that Flynn is sitting at a terminal in clear sight of the dematerializing laser, so he zaps Flynn into the Matrix.</p><p>Inside the mainframe, we're introduced to <b>Sark</b>, who is Dillinger's program.  If MCP were The Emperor, Sark who be Darth Vader.  His loyal foot soldier who does all the evil deeds without reserve.  Sark gathers up spare and discarded programs and forces them to fight each other in <b>Games</b>.</p><p>There's a little bit of religion stuffed into the plot, as MCP's method of subjugating other programs is dispelling all knowledge of Users.  Some programs believe them to exist, but it's only a legend.</p><p>Flynn is himself when he's inside the mainframe, and meets up with programs that resemble his pals in real life.  Tron resembles Alan.  Lora's program, <b>Yori</b>, resembles her.  They all journey to defeat MCP and restore peace from his tyranny.  Also, throughout the adventure, Flynn figures out he has "god-like" powers over the mainframe because he's a User.</p><p>Spoiler Alert, they defeat Sark and MCP at the end of the movie.  Flynn gets zapped back to real life, and he recovers the evidence he needs to take down Dillinger.  The last scene of the movie shows Flynn flying in on a helicopter and assuming his role as CEO of ENCOM.  HAPPY ENDING!</p><div class='title'><b>Tron Legacy Setup</b></div><p>Fast forward, 28 years later to today, and we have Tron Legacy.  Tron Night showed us 5 scenes from the finished film.  And the first one reiterated what we already know about the initial plot of the film.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 1</b></div><p>The Scene starts with <b>Samuel Flynn</b> returning to his garage home somewhere in the city.  Sam Flynn is son of Kevin Flynn, and he's 27 years old.  <b>Alan Bradley</b> enters the scene and says something like, "That was some stunt you pulled today," referring to some hijinks Sam pulled at ENCOM.  It's been 20 years since Kevin Flynn has mysteriously disappeared, and Sam is agressivly reluctant to take over ENCOM in his father's place.</p><p>Sam tells Alan to fuck off, and Alan is all like "some day you'll understand."  Before leaving, Alan mentions he received a page last night.  The last thing that Flynn said to Alan was to keep the pager at all times, and when the time comes, you'll get further instructions.  The instructions were to go to Flynn's Arcade.  Alan suggests that Sam revisit that abandoned arcade and investigate.</p><p>Next we see Sam riding to the Arcade.  He goes inside and looks around.  He finds a secret passageway behind the Tron arcade game, which leads to a secret room with computers and a dematerializing laser.  Sam starts typing away at the computer, and runs the last instruction, which zaps him into the computer.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 2</b></div><p>The preview skips ahead a little bit to the point where Sam is caught by security drones and brought to central processing with a couple other stray programs.  JUST LIKE THE FIRST MOVIE, Sam is sent to the pit and readied to be in <b>The Games</b>.  He's given his disc-thingy, and then pushed off somewhere.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 3</b></div><p>Sam finds himself in a multi-staged arena.  There's about 8 fights going on.  All are 2 player matches between programs using their discs as weapons.  Sam learns pretty quick that this is a fight to the death, when he sees a victory in another ring.  His "Oh my god what's going on" defense quickly turns into an inexperienced but calculated win as he blows away the ground underneath his opponent.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 4</b></div><p>Oh, I guess Sam has escaped with the help of a masked program.  They're driving away in an all terrain vehicle, while security drones give chase in their light cycles.  They kill a couple drones, but more continue pursuit.  They reach a cliff and go off the end of it into rough unkept terrain which light cycles cannot follow.  They've escaped!</p><p>The masked hero reveals herself to be <b>Quorra</b>, but doesn't mention her importance in the story.  The reach an outpost in the barren wasteland, and go inside.</p><div class='title'><b>Scene 5</b></div><p>Quorra brings Sam into a room to reunite him with Flynn.  After they exchange a bunch of heartfelt words, Flynn says something about what's going on, but I don't remember what it was because I had no frame of reference at the time.  I don't think it was much to go on anyways.  </p><p>Also, he calls Quorra his apprentice.  And Flynn has a custom version 1.0 Light Cycle in his room that Quorra says is still the fastest vehicle on the grid.</p><div class='title'><b>Trailer</b></div><p>Right when I thought they were going to unveil more of the overall plot, it was over.  At the end of Scene 5, it goes into the Daft Punk trailer posted to youtube earlier last week.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPFpcKm0B7U">Youtube!</a></p><p>The footage in the first half of the trailer we had already seen that night from the actual scenes, but they added some extended cuts of fight scenes and light cycle chases.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Going into the preview, I hadn't seen Tron in forever, and only knew that Flynn had disappeared in the Matrix and his son goes after him.  Plot-wise, I was hoping to find out more about why Flynn went back into the computer, and what was going on.  There was none of that.  I exited the theater having gained no knowledge of Tron Legacy at all, which was incredibly disappointing.  I really can't form a decent opinion about the movie if I have no idea where it's going.</p><p>But it's definitely pretty.  Really damn pretty.  The preview was in 3D, and I really liked how it wasn't 3D at all in real life, but was completely 3D inside the computer.  It made for a fun transition.</p><p>If you've seen any trailer, or even watch the youtube I posted above, the look of Tron Legacy is gorgeous.  I love the art direction.  All the environments have this luminescent tint outlining their structure against a black surface.  Everything is crisp and clean, like everything is made of glass.  And the 3D effects ephasize the glassy translucent look of everything.  It's marvelous.</p><p>That's really why I'm into this movie.  The first moment I saw how everything looked, I was hooked.  And that's really what Tron has been about since the beginning.  The highest praise Tron ever got was that it was really damn pretty.  "A Technological Achievement."  </p><div class='title'><b>As a movie, it was Okay, but it didn't suck.  That's really the kicker.  Tron Legacy just needs an Okay story underneath to keep itself from ruining the marvelous visuals.</b></div><p>It might need something else though...</p><div class='title'><b>Tron's Legacy</b></div><p>Tron is not an easy movie to find.  Netflix does not have it on Instant Streaming, AND it no longer offers the discs.  If you turn to Half.com and Ebay, you'll only find copies of the DVD going for much more than you'd spend on a DVD these days.  They haven't released it on Bluray, but I expect the probably will when Tron Legacy does.</p><p>I watched it by downloading a torrent, but it ended up having an Italian dub over the dialogue.  Thank God the story isn't that complicated.  I knew what was going on thanks to Wikipedia's synposis.</p><p><b>I think having detailed knowledge of what was going on in the first movie is pretty important to understanding everything in Tron Legacy.</b>  Otherwise, the visuals won't be enough to dazzle you, and the movie will fall flat.</p><p>If you haven't seen Tron since you were a kid, name 3 or 5 things you remember from the film.  These things would probably include Jeff Bridges, Light Cycles, Disc Throwing, the Big Red Spinning Head Thing, and the whole landscape inside of the computer.</p><p>You probably don't remember the part about CLU dying at the beginning.  Or why or how Flynn even got into the computer.  Or that Flynn never uses his Disc once, in fact I think he drops it halfway through the film.  Or that Tron is a security program.  Or who Alan Bradley is.</p><p>Anyways, Good Luck finding a copy of Tron to watch.  You can't even go to Blockbuster now.  Maybe Family Video might have a copy?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Finale" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-finale">Dexter Season 4 Finale</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This season has been fantastic.  Normally, once Premium Channel TV shows (HBO, Showtime) start to become stale, they don't return.  Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, and other great shows start off incredibly strong.  But after Season 2 of Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood after Season 1, they completely fall to ruin.  They either forget what made them a success or can't figure out how to hold on to it.</p><p>Once I finished watching Dexter Season 3, I thought, "This is it.  Dexter is over."  Season 3 went in random directions at times, and ignored the success of Seasons 1 and 2.  Dexter didn't kill anyone for himself.  He didn't learn anything (other than the overall lesson of the season).  It had no personality, in my opinion.</p><p>Season 4 broke this stale curse.  It wasn't some dull misdirected meaningless story.  It's own self-contained story of the Trinity killer was interesting enough.  He was the first truly horrific serial killer.  Dexter saw him as a mentor, and a friend, but Trinity's demons could not be contained.  The writers weaved him into the Dexter mythos and with it brought more than just a lesson learned.</p><div class='title'><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></div><p>Now with Rita murdered as a Trinity victim, and Deb confronting Dexter about Brian Moser, I think Dexter has run out of excuses.  It annoys me how everyone just believes Dexter when he makes up these flimsy excuses, and no one thinks anything else of it.  I guess this is what happens when you kill off Doukes, the only person to actually question Dexter about what he's doing.  </p><p>Thank god Deb has started assuming this role and actually asked Dexter about his peculiar appearance at the raid on Arthur Mitchel's house.  I hope her role in Season 5 eventually leads to realization.</p><p>With Dexter only renewed through Season 5, currently, I wonder if the writers will end Dexter.  Business-wise it would be a stupid move.  The Season 4 Finale is the most watched episode of any Showtime original series with 2.6 million viewers.  But Story-wise, it would make Dexter incredibly tight.  It would never reach the point of being stale.</p><p>When Deb actually verifies the demon inside of Dexter, where would the show go from there anyways?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4-episodes-3-and-4">Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Season 4 of Dexter has been pretty decent so far.  It doesn't have the same allure and mystery of the first season, but definitely allows the characters to show some rich emotions.  There's plenty of suspense too.  But there have been a few things in these past 2 episodes that have really shown that Dexter, as a show, is back on its game.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b></em></p><div class='title'><b>The emotionless nature of a killer</b></div><p>In the beginning of episode 3, the Trinity killer works away on his second victim.  He brings her to the top of a warehouse and forces her to jump off by her own will.  Getting her to the warehouse and bringing her to the top is pretty easy, but now he has to threaten her to kill herself.  He does so by threatening her family.  With her children in danger, she lets go of the railing and falls to her death.</p><p>Near the end of the episode, Dexter is hunting down the neighborhood vandal.  He discovers who it is, and confronts him in his garage.  Exposing the vandal's identity isn't enough for the vandal to stop ruining the neighborhood.  Dexter roughs him up a little bit, but the vandal refuses.  He has nothing to lose.  Dexter threatens the vandal's family, and the vandal changes his mind pretty quickly.</p><p>I find it interesting how both Trinity and Dexter arrive to the same persuasive tactics, when all other options have been exhausted.  Being killers, they have no emotional connection to their victim, their victim's lives, or life in general.  They will stop at nothing to get their way, and will perform any action to get it.</p><p>Though, it doesn't really sound like much, but it was a parallel occurrence in this episode that linked Trinity and Dexter.  Dexter (the show) attempts to profile what it is to be a killer.  Every killer doesn't follow the same code, but perhaps a killer's code has a general set of guidelines?</p><div class='title'><b>Solving problems</b></div><p>Dexter's "dark passenger" brings him to interesting places and follows convenient leads.  Though, many of those leads in the first two seasons were very convenient for story.  In Season 1, Dexter stalked and killed a couple who were exploiting illegal Cuban immigrants.  After capturing and subduing the couple, he actually talked with them a little bit about relationships and how to "make it work."</p><p>Dexter was having trouble figuring out how to act as a boyfriend to Rita and didn't have anyone to talk to.  The only people he really can talk to are his victims, those who see Dexter for who he really is.  Dexter has no trouble talking to them about this problems, because he's comfortable.  He knows this conversation and "friendship" has a very soon expiration date.  This happens a couple other times, especially when confronts the man who killed his mother.</p><p>In episode 4 of Season 4, Dexter (the show) returns to this problem solving technique when Dexter (the character) stalks and captures a woman who murdered her own family.  A woman who couldn't take the annoying, badgering, constant time loss of the daily grind of family life, so she "solved" it in a way most convenient for her.</p><p>Dexter has been fighting many of the same problems with married life, and "talks" about them with his victim.  Through their dialogue, he grows.  He finds out in himself that he really loves his family and that he would do anything to keep them from harm.</p><p>The release of his dark passenger always gives him clarity.  Room enough to think his way through his social problems.  Yes, killing does get in the way of his family life, but it's essential for his character growth, and for the show as well.</p><p>I don't remember this happening in Season 3 at all.</p><div class='title'><b>8 episodes remain</b></div><p>Season 4 is certainly returning to what made Dexter great.  I still think they're throwing too much suspense into the mix to distract away from the many many plot lines that no one cares about.  But Dexter and Trinity are the stars of this Season and are going strong.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter Season 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-season-4">Dexter Season 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Like Seasons 2 and 3, the first episode of the new Season of Dexter was leaked to the Internet just a few weeks before its premiere.  It's almost like it's intentional.  It definitely seemed intentional with Seasons 2 and 3.  The quality of the DivX file was superb.  The file I have of Season 4 episode 1 is pretty crappy, so I don't think it was intentional this time.  But who knows...</p><div class='title'><b>Where we've been</b></div><p>Dexter is a pretty great show.  Season 1 was an amazing introduction to Dexter.  It displayed Dexter's thoughts and reasoning.  The emergence of a rival serial killer offered mystery, and eventually unraveled into a mirror of himself, his past, and his future.</p><p>Season 2 lost the mystery, but masked it with constant suspense.  Season 2 builds on all the character development from the previous season and demonstrates how well rounded the characters and cast are.  Unfortunately, it is a shallow experience compared to the first Season.</p><p>The typecast, thin representation of the Dexter cast really shows its colors in Season 3.  Season 3 settles down the suspense and mystery and adds character plot after character plot.  Dexter starts to lose spotlight, and Debra, Angel, and Laguerta become essential characters.  I think the writers and producers have become to comfortable with their jobs after Dexter was renewed up through Season 5 given the success of Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>The acting and writing has become very much like a sitcom.  Each actor has their character and always operates in these roles.  The only person that brings any personality to their character is Michael C. Hall with Dexter, which is ironic as he plays an emotionally distanced character.  It's gotten so transparent that it's difficult to watch.</p><p>I'd stop watching the show if I wasn't so invested in these characters.  Plus, I hold hope that Dexter will eventually recapture what made Season 1 so fantastic.  But I think they've completely run Dexter's character dry for story.  Maybe that's why the other characters have become so prevalent.</p><p>Season 3 is a stain in this series and takes it further away from what made it great.  Though, after watching the first episode of Season 4 that gleaming shimmer of hope flickers in my eye.</p><div class='title'><b>New Beginnings</b></div><p>Once the news broke that <b>John Lithgow</b> was the villian in Season 4, I was immediately excited.  Finally, a REAL actor in this dying show.  Michael C. Hall is a pretty good actor, but his range is not nearly as vast as Lithgow.  I was excited to see what they had in store.  Plus, there hasn't been a serial killer villain worth his weight since Season 1.</p><p>Rudy (or whomever) was the perfect villain for Season 1.  But Season 2 and 3?  Technically both seasons had its share of minor villains that Dexter had to vex in order to come out on top.  The story was spread and became weak as a result.  Aside from John Lithgow, Season 4's focus of a single villain should make the story much tighter.</p><div class='title'><b>Or is it..?</b></div><p>Unfortunately, with all these characters and stories of their own, I feel that the serial killing aspect of the show will become less and less important.  The writers seem to care more about the supporting cast and Dexter's home life than what the show was about to begin with.</p><p>Dexter always killed people as an outward expression of dealing with his problems.  It helped him work shit out.  But now, it just seems like he would be better off if he didn't.  His problems are the result of his serial killing.  So give it up!  Dexter already proved that this is not an addiction, so why is he still killing if it's screwing things up?</p><div class='title'><b>Ramble Ramble</b></div><p>Even though I'm pretty negative about the show, I'm still optimistic that Season 4 will turn out alright.

| September 1, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Funny People is an interesting, weird and bizarre movie.  It's not necessary unlike anything Judd Apatow has done before, but it's certainly different and stand apart.</p><div class='title'><b>Slice of Life</b></div><p>Judd Apatow's strength has been his ability to translate real life on screen.  From the teenagers in Freaks and Geeks, to the freshmen in Undeclared, to the young adults in Knocked Up... from the awkward to the serious, Apatow has covered a wide range of emotions in his body of work.  So, it stands to reason that several emotions would affect the audience and hit rather close to home.</p><p>Freaks and Geeks detailed several aspects of my life, past and present, which made me painfully curious to watch.  One of my friends found Knocked Up difficult to watch as it detailed a life that would have been his.  Read all about it in these two horribly written and awkward blog posts from 2 years ago: <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks">Oct 27th 2007</a>, <a href="/old/v7/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">Oct 28th 2007</a>.</p><p>These movies and TV shows demand your attention if you've lived these lives, but can lose your attention if you haven't.  Funny People certainly didn't lose my attention, but it showcased lives that were not mine.  So, it didn't affect me the way Freaks and Geeks mirrored my soul.</p><div class='title'><b>Comedy</b></div><p>So much of a comedian's life is in this film.  Between Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler, they could put a real-life name to every character.  The experiences they've shared living together in Los Angeles and performing comedy at The Improv must've given them a wealth of stories for inspiration in a lot of the film's plot.</p><p>Seth Rogen's character, Ira Wright, is most likely based on Judd Apatow's struggle to be a successful stand up comedian.  He writes some pretty good jokes, but he's not very confident and they come out awkward.  His friends and roommates find successes in their careers, but he's left behind.  This was probably the exact setting in the mid to late 80s for Apatow and Sandler.  They probably had 3 or 4 years before Sandler was discovered in 1990 and hired in New York for Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Ira's luck changes when a famous comedian stumble's upon his act. Recognized for his writing talents, he's hired to write some jokes.  The same thing happened to Judd Apatow when Roseanne Barr caught his act in the late 80s.  I'd like to see that movie!  But, in Ira's case it is George Simmons, Adam Sandler's character.</p><p>George Simmons is a movie star, whose life has become empty with success.  He doesn't speak with his family, he has no close friends, and un-married, which doesn't describe Adam Sandler at all (from what I can tell, anyways).  George Simmons has made an onslaught of terrible embarrassing movies which define his career.  Adam Sandler has made some bad movies, but not as embarrassing as some of his colleagues, especially his pal Rob Schneider.  Though, Adam Sandler plays George Simmons as himself.  The way he talks and does comedy is all Sandler.</p><div class='title'><b>Groupies</b></div><p>An actual piece of Adam Sandler's reality placed in the film are groupies.  Now a days, Sandler has probably given up sex with random women, but after Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, he couldn't get rid of the amount of women at his doorstep.</p><p>This is shown in the film when Sandler and Seth Rogen pick up two girls at some Hollywood party.  Sandler fucks one girl. As Rogen fails with the other one, Sandler fucks her too.  He remarks on his behavior as it being easy for him, "These girls want to fulfill their fantasy to fuck a movie star, and I take advantage of that.  It doesn't matter because they always leave unsatisfied."  It's kinda like Sandler is apologizing to all the girls he took advantage of before his marriage.</p><p>I think this is true because this is the second instance Movie Star Groupies has come up between Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow.  Sandler guest starred in an episode of Undeclared where he did the exact same thing.  Though, in the context of the show, it was much more flattering for Sandler at the time. Especially since he wasn't married at the time.</p><div class='title'><b>Juxtaposition and age</b></div><p>Funny People bounces back and forth between Seth Rogen and Adam Sandler equally.  Seth Rogen experiences the beginning of a comedian's career, while Adam Sandler experiences the end, so to speak.  When Seth Rogen is thrust into the celebrity life style, he's shocked and amazed at all the perks and treats.  Adam Sandler just shrugs it off because this is his life.  He's the icon and that how he lives.</p><p>Adam Sandler begins showing his age and comments how the comedic life style is a young person's game.  If you have the talent, you will get discovered and you will thrive.  Horrible comedians don't last very long in the beginning. Comedians make almost no money doing stand up, and that life style weeds out the poor comedians pretty quickly.  You must put yourself through this hell so you can emerge victorious.</p><p>Being able to laugh at your situation is your muse.  And that ability is used quite often in Funny People, almost always at the sacrifice of good film making.</p><div class='title'><b>Technical Failure?</b></div><p>The pacing of Funny People is a horrible mess.  Serious scenes are often interrupted and almost ruined by the diversion of comedy.  For most of the movie, it's almost as if they had an outline of the plot and story, and then just filled in all the blanks while recording.</p><p>The interruptions aren't necessarily unwarranted.  A lot the abrupt comedy is presented as a coping mechanism to deal with the weight of the situation or bring the atmosphere back to something they're used to.  They are "Funny People" after all, so it makes sense that they'd deal with seriousness in a funny way.</p><p>From a technical standpoint, it makes the movie difficult to watch because it's constantly trying to be two movies at once.  There were point I thought were funny, but didn't know if I was supposed to laugh or if they were trying to be funny.  It's really confusing...</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>But overall, Funny People really stuck with me.  So much of Judd Apatow and Adam Sandler are in the film.  It's hard not to like the honesty and reality.  Adam Sandler is great in the film and the supporting cast is hilarious.</p><p>At 2 hours 15 minutes, it is a little long though.  As the film rounded the 2 hour mark, I was wondering when they were going to end it.  Is this the end?  nope..  Is this the end? nope...  They did end on a good note though. ^_^</p><p>Definitely check it out if you're a fan of the Apatow crew.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The History and Timeline of District 9" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-history-and-timeline-of-district-9">The History and Timeline of District 9</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 17, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>[<i>Hi.  This is written for people who have seen the film, District 9.  It contains several spoilers towards the end, so make sure to see the film first.  The information about South African history was taken from articles on Wikipedia.</i>]</p><div class='title'><b>British Colonization</b></div><p>After the British invaded in the 1800s and began colonizing South Africa, violence continued to climb between the colonials and the natives.  Racial violence had to stop.  In the 1890s, the British ruling party began to groundwork of what would become the Apartheid system.</p><p>It began with the Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892, which limited education.  The General Pass Regulations Bill of 1905 denied them their right to vote.  The South Africa Act of 1910 gave the British ruling power over all races of South Africa.  The Native Land Act of 1913 kept blacks from buying land outside of their "reserves".  The Natives in Urban Areas Bill of 1918 forced blacks into their own communities.  The Urban Areas Act of 1923 gave the white industry plenty of cheap labor.  The Native Administration Act of 1927 gave the British ruling over all South African affairs  The Native Land and Trust Act of 1936 which further strengthened the 1913 law.  (and) The Asiatic Land Tenure Bill of 1946 which kept the natives from selling their land to foreigners other than the British.</p><div class='title'><b>Apartheid</b></div><p>These laws became an institution beginning in 1948 known as Apartheid.  This system would further strengthen in the years to follow as further legislation was passed to refine and tighten these bills.  Segregation continued and was upheld by law.</p><p>The laws of Apartheid would prohibit marriage and sexual acts between race, require all citizens to carry and ID card with their race classification, demolish "run down" black neighborhoods, ban communism (of course), crafted a separate education system, and the Black Homeland Citizen Act of 1970 which removed black citizenship altogether!</p><p>In 1966, these laws were used in Cape Town, to forcibly remove the black population of 60,000 from District Six to Cape Flats, 25km away.</p><div class='title'><b>Protesting</b></div><p>As the laws became increasingly ridiculous, students from all races in Africa began protesting the ruling government.  The tipping point began on June 16, 1976 during the Soweto Uprising.  Students took to the streets and protested the forced tuition.  Police opened fire on the peaceful protest killing up to 600 and injuring 4000.  After that, student organizations were formed for the pure purpose of protesting Apartheid.  These organizations were formed all around the entire country.</p><p>Labor Unions began protesting with the students.  Churches joined the protests, too.  The black and native communities began to unite.</p><div class='title'><b>Civil War</b></div><p>South African security was the biggest political concern of the 1980s.  With increased violence and continuous offenses to the Apartheid System, President PW Botha declared a State of Emergency on July 20, 1985 in the most prominent areas of the country.  Under the Internal Security Act, people were put under house arrest and detained without trial.  On June 12, 1986 (4 days before the 10th Anniversary of the Soweto Uprising), the State of Emergency extended to the entire country.  In 1987, the State of Emergency was renewed up through 1989.  Over those 4 years, 30,000 people were detained, arrested, interrogated and many tortured.</p><p>In 1989, President Botha suffered a stroke and was forced to resign.  On February 13, 1989, he was succeeded by FW de Klerk.  De Klerk made moves to end the political stalemate and repeal the laws of Apartheid.</p><div class='title'><b>A New Threat?</b></div><p>1990 was the pivotal point in South African history that would demolish the Apartheid system.  However, things changed a little bit when a huge alien mothership set itself in the air directly above Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city.  It just appeared there and gave no indication of its plans.  After 3 months with no communication, the government flew to the craft, bore a hole through its hull, and discovered an alien race inside.  </p><p>They were extremely weak and malnourished.  The South African government began extracting the population of one million.  They gave them District 9.</p><p>With the discovery of a new life form to earth, the South Africa population united and quickly negotiated a resolution to the Apartheid system peacefully and successfully.  But enacted new laws to "handle" the alien population.  The Apartheid system was reborn and segregated aliens and humans.  These laws seemed to make sense given they were a completely separate life form.</p><p>The aliens seemed aimless and savage.  Many have speculated as to how they achieved the intelligence to constructor and operate the interstellar vessel that brought them to our planet.  The popular theory is that the population is mostly workers or soldiers without leadership or direction.  Those aliens in power either abandoned ship or are deceased.</p><div class='title'><b>Alive in Joburg</b></div><p>In 2005, Neill Blomkamp (director of District 9) created a documentary of life in Johannesburg.  It's available online on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837">Google Video</a> and on <a href="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg" title="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg">SpyFilms website</a>.  The film has been released by SpyFilms.</p><p>Alive in Joburg demonstrates the living conditions of District 9.  The aliens scavenge garbage piles for food.  They eat raw meat from slaughter cows.  The stench is awful.</p><div class='title'><b>Neill Blomkamp</b></div><p>Alive in Joburg was the first work created by Neill Blomkamp, and sparked the attention of Peter Jackson.  In 2007, they teamed up to create a short film entitled Crossing the Line (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q">trailer</a>).  Impressed with Blomkamp's vision and ideals, Jackson contracted Blomkamp to direct the film version of Halo, the popular Xbox game.</p><p>Constant disagreements between Microsoft and the movie studios cast doubt on Blomkamp who had never directed a full motion picture.  Though, Peter Jackson had no doubt in his mind.  Jackson and Blomkamp talked about revisiting Alive in Joburg and expanding.  In 2007 or 2008, Jackson put the Halo film on hiatus and they began to create District 9.</p><div class='title'><b>District 9</b></div><p>Next Year will mark the 20th Anniversary of the alien arrival in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The conditions of District 9 have become out of control, and the government wlll contract private arms corporation MNU to move the alien population to a location 200km away from Johannesburg labeled District 10.</p><p>Wkus var de Merwe is appointed head of the operation to extract the aliens from District 9.  He's a very lovable Michael Scott type of person.  Wikus var de Merwe is portrayed by Sharlto Copley who has almost no movie credits to his name.  District 9 is his actorial debut.  His only previous credit of note is the writer/director of the film Spoon released in 2008.</p><p>The extraction goes awry when Wikus contracts a virus from a recovered alien artifact.</p><div class='title'><b>Filming</b></div><p>Even though District 9 adopts the documentary style of Alive in Joburg, it fills in the rest of the story with traditional film portrayal.  The documentary style is vital for providing the history and information about District 9 and the events of August 8-10, 2010.  The traditional style provides the story of Wikus and his internal struggle with the virus.</p><p>The film's main focus is Apartheid.  District 9 is drenched in Apartheid commentary but it's not delivered in a history lesson (such as this post).  In fact, it's not even mentioned once!  I find that incredibly interesting.  I didn't know any about Apartheid until I read reviews after seeing the movie.</p><p>The social commentary is pretty thick, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film.  It builds tremendous sympathy for the aliens, though "white" guilt may factor, too.</p><div class='title'><b>To Be Continued...?</b></div><p>As the virus mutates and transforms Wikus into one of the aliens, he aids one of the alien pilots into recovering the fuel for the mothership.  On August 10, 2010, the pilot reboards the mothership with his shuttle pod and the mothership leaves earth.  He tells Wikus that it will take him 3 years to return to earth and promises that he will return to restore Wikus back into a human.  The remaining alien population is moved to District 10 and Wikus has completely vanished.</p><p>Will Peter Jackson and Neill Blomkamp return to Johannesburg in 2013 when the mothership is expected to return?</p><p>It seems pretty definite to me.  In 3 days, it earned $37 million in the US, making a profit of $7 million.  With an absolutely hit on their hands and an open ending with expected future events, why wouldn't they make District 10?</p><p>But it might be awhile since Neill Blomkamp has proven his cinematic prowess to the film studios, and Microsoft will probably want to get the Halo film back on track.  Will the Halo movie be put on hold again for a District 9 sequel?  Will Halo be Blomkamp's next film?  Or will they scrap both ideas for something completely new?</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>I'm pretty sure this timeline is correct.  I was paying close attention to the dates in District 9 when I saw it for the second time today.  The video feed from cameras during Wikus' capture and manhunt state Aug 10 2010.  The film mentions that the mothership has been on earth for 20 years, putting the arrival date in 1990.  1990 is also the date given in Alive in Joburg.  Wikipedia backs up this information.</p><p>However, the film synopsis on most film sites say the mothership arrived 30 years ago and the Theatrical Trailer says 28 years ago.  I don't know what the believe now.  Of course, trailers aren't created by the studio, it's created by the corporation to market the thing.</p><p>They probably just got the date wrong.  And all the film sites base their synopsis from the trailer.  Though, the commentary on the eventually rental release should be interesting as to what is actually going on here.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost in Translation" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-in-translation">Lost in Translation</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm sure I've seen Lost in Translation before today.  Lost in Translation is a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  It's about two people who aren't very happy, and then are subjected to culture shock to make it worse.  Through their culture shock and depression they meet each other. And bring each other out of it.</p><p>I could've sworn I've seen it before, but despite taking place in Japan and starring Bill Murray, it didn't make an impression on me.  Though in October 2003, I was in a different place.  Happy and in love.  Lost in Translation's heavy tones fell on my deaf ears.</p><div class='title'><b>Isolation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp"  /></p><p>When I find myself alone in Japan, there is always that looming sense of isolation.  I can ask questions and receive answers, but there is no one I can really engage in conversation.  All I have are my thoughts to bounce ideas off of.  I text, email or IM people back home, but the sound of my own voice becomes mute.  It becomes a treasure when I actually have another American (like myself) to talk to.  I thought Scarlett Johansson nailed that emotion perfectly when the film followed her around for a day.</p><p>Those scenes really are the perfect picture of a lone foreigner wandering about the daily lives of a population that is not their own.  For the most part, everyone just ignores the outsider.  Everyone is plugged into their lives, and have no business getting into others.  Children will sometimes break those boundaries, but that's only because they haven't been incorporated into society, yet.</p><p>Though, I've never experienced the agoraphobic culture shock to the point of incapacitation.  The only times it has taken anchor has been when I've truly been alone in Japan.  But, I just throw those emotions away.  My time in Japan has always been short and limited.  It would be a waste to be stuck in a tiny hotel room.</p><div class='title'><b>Language</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp"  /></p><p>Obviously, I identify far more with Scarlett Johansson's character's silent brooding wonderment, than Bill Murray's case.  Though when I'm in Japan, it's for absolutely no purpose than to wander around and look at things.  If I were there on business, as is Bill Murray's character, my culture shock probably wouldn't be as agoraphobic.  His culture shock is in the language and miss-communication.  I don't have much trouble in that department.</p><p>The scene where Bill Murray is waiting in the hospital talking with the granny is a conversation I've had many times in Japan. ^_^  Japanese people will always try to dumb down their language to what they think is simple for you, but is often what makes them even more difficult to understand.  I know sentence structure, noun forms, and what is being said, I just can't translate some of the words because my vocabulary is horrible.  Maybe I just need to ask, "What is this word?"</p><p>Though, a lot of the Japanese dialogue in the film is pretty easy to understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Moments</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp"  /></p><p>Lost in Translation ends in the same manor many moments end in Japan.  A moment is that is truly final.  A moment that can only take place in a single moment of your life and one that can never be relived.  A "Goodbye" that is goodbye forever.</p><p>Charolette and Bob Harris depart under these terms and embrace with the knowledge they will never see each other again.  Because time in Japan always comes with an expiration date.  And when it expires, that is it.  The end.  And that is where the film ends.</p><div class='title'><b>Epilogue, aka Reverse Culture Shock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp"  /></p><p>In real life, most of these moments are final, but that is not the end of the story.  The epilogue is returning to life before Japan.  Taken away from isolation and plugged back in familiarity and understanding.  For some people this is a breath of fresh air.  People to finally talk to!  People who understand me!  For me, I cherish the isolation.</p><p>Nothing bothers me in Japan.  People keep to themselves and are polite to each other.  Store clerks say thank you and go out of their way to ensure your satisfaction.  Being a foreigner, I'm a guest in their country and they treat me as such.</p><p>Back in America, Life sucks.  Everyone is unhappy because they HAVE to work today.  A single customer asking a single request is WAY TOO GODDAMN much of a hassle.  People think too much of themselves rather than the company they represent.  They think of the company paying them for their services, rather than them earning their pay for giving their services.</p><p>Everything in life returns to the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary.  Here's what I thought when I first got back after those 3.5 months studying abroad: <a href="/old/v7/home" title="/home">December 29th, 2006</a>.</p><p>Showing this side of being in Japan would have truly ruined Lost in Translation.</p><div class='title'><b>Passion!</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost in Translation fell on deaf ears because I didn't know anything about this.  I never had these moments.  I never experienced such isolation.  I never had to talk through a language barrier.  All these points resonate beautifully in the film.  So much so that I can never watch it again.  Unless it's with my friends from the Fall 2006 Class of Nagasaki Gaigokugo Daigaku.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/film/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/film">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
