| July 21, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Throughout my life, I can count a number of cultural keystones that have dramatically shaped my tastes and perceptions.  Keystones in the form of music, movies, television, video games and combinations of these forms of entertainment.</p><p>Around 1995 was when I finally heard that pulsing electronic sound that has been with me every since.  I heard it on television from MTV's Amp.  I heard it from video games in Wipeout XL.  I heard it in the movies from Hackers.  Drowning in a raging auditory ocean of Rock, Pop, Country, Oldies, this distant dynamic sound was so completely different.  Once I heard these tracks and that sound, I knew I had found music that was for me.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple years later that I discovered Sasha and other DJs that really opened my eyes and ears to the Electronic Music genre as a whole.  But for a time, I had a couple songs that were my own.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Had I seen <b>Trainspotting</b> back in my youth, it probably would've been sitting alongside those I mentioned earlier.  Trainspotting is very rich in music, character, life, satire..  There's some amazing camera shots, and scene transitions..  This movie has it all.</p><p>10 years ago, I would've watched this movie again and again, dissected every scene, put meaning to the randomness, placed myself in character's shoes..  But today, I'm just along for the ride.  Trainspotting oozes with Youth, especially seeing a young Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Johnny Lee Miller, and Kelly MacDonald run around in their low to mid 20s.</p><p>The music and the faces bring me back 10 years to the mid-ish 90s.  Young and ripe.  It's the same feeling I get whenever I pop in Hackers or listen to Atom Bomb, Papua New Guinea, Cowgirl, Halcyon.. (by Fluke, Future Sound of London, Underworld, Orbital).</p><p>I'm not sure if anyone else's brain works this way, but a specific melody or tune can bring back the most vibrant memories of my past than words or stories.  Whenever I hear Atom Bomb, I'm instantly transported back to my room at age 16ish watching Amp on MTV's around 2 in the morning.  Whenever I hear the Facility background music from Goldeneye 007, I'm instantly transported to Justin's Mom's house in Wayzata playing N64 with him around 11pm after working at Toys R Us for the night.</p><p>I guess the same works with images too, but it's not as powerful as hearing.  It's a powerful touchstone at a singular point in my life that can always be revived by that distinctive sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Anyways, I'm sure I would've loved this movie If I saw it back then.  But better late than never, I suppose. ^_^.</p><p>As mentioned before, Ewan McGregor is the main star of this movie, who has gone on to be young Obi-wan Kenobi in the Star Wars Pre-Trilogy.  Kelly MacDonald is in this movie too!  In fact, it's her very first role in a movie.  She's the wife in No Country for Old Men.  Also, Paige Marshall in Choke.</p><p>Also, Trainspotting is directed by Danny Boyle, whom you might know as the director of Slumdog Millionaire.  He also directed 28 Days Later.</p><p>It's also interesting that almost all the actors in Trainspotting are actually scottish, except for Johnny Lee Miller.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Xtro" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/xtro">Xtro</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>About a week ago, I saw one of the cheesiest, most bizarre movies I've ever seen, Xtro.  I have no idea how I came across this title.  Nor do I know how it became to exist in my Netflix queue.  But, I'm quite glad that I had the pleasure of viewing this treasure.</p><p>Xtro is ultimately about a boy.  Little Tony is scarred at a young age by the disappearance of his father, Sam.  They were out for an ordinary game of catch, when POOF!  Aliens appear from beyond the mountains and abduct Sam.  Alone, Tony grieves for his loss.  Returning home, no one believes him.  Those who don't know the truth believe that Sam had run away from his responsibilities as a father.  The aliens couldn't have picked a worse time to intervene as things hadn't really been going well at home.</p><p>3 years later, things have actually turned out better for everyone except Tony.  His mother is now with a cool hunky photographer.  They live in downtown London where all the magic happens.  Tony has a super hot babysitter who gets naked several times throughout the film.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tony has recurring nightmares of his father's abduction.  He wakes throughout the night from his own screams and whimpers.  Alas, his mother still does not believe him.  "Quite whining and shut up about that ridiculous lie.  He left us!"  She would say as she burst into his room, afterward returning to her bed with her super-fly boyfriend.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the forests outside of London the aliens return!  They appear above the trees and deposit an odd creature.  An infantile organism that begins to adapt and move across the forest bed...  it finds the smooth pavement of a nearby road, and then suddenly finds the bumper of an oncoming car.  Shocked by ramming such a weird looking animal, the automobile stops and its occupants search for the wounded being.  Of course, the alien finds them first.</p><p>Meanwhile, later, the alien finds itself upon a cabin in the woods with a lone female occupant.  You may guess what might happen next.  Bow-chicka-wow-wow...  The alien impregnates the woman and runs off.  Never to be seen in the film again.  Startled by such an event, the young woman is dazed but then feels the fetus inside her.</p><p>The fetus rapidly grows and...  here's a clip of what happens next as she gives birth...  [find it on youtube]</p><p>It's Sam!  Sam is back from outer space and ready to relive his life as Tony's father.  Of course he doesn't actually remember being abducted.</p><p>As you might expect, drama occurs, then murder, then boobs, then it gets weird.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>Ultimately, Sam's purpose for return was to retrieve Tony.  But in order for Tony to adapt to space travel, he must under go a transformation process.  Sam bestows the power to overcome adaption to space.  As the power matures inside of Tony, he gains the power to materialize his hallucinations. But ultimately, he's taken over by the power's control.</p><p>Tony's first order of business is to create a friend.  The friend that he's always wanted!  A creepy clown midget will do.  Next!  Kill all my annoying neighbors with life sized versions of my toys.  Kill my asshole step dad.  Kill that asshole elderly woman, downstairs.  Kill the hot naked babysitter for some reason.  Actually, wait a minute.  Don't kill her.  Knock her out.  Mutate her womb.  And then collect the alien eggs she produces.  Next!  Tip over the refrigerator.  Fill it with Guacamole.  And use it as an incubator for more aliens.  The perfect plan!</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam lures Mom back to the forest.  Tony appears.  And off they go to Never Never Land.  Leaving the mom a wake of bodies and loneliness on earth.</p><p>The end.</p><div class='title'><b>Bold!</b></div><p>I wish the Science Fiction movies of today had the bizarre spin of movies from the late 70s, early 80s.  Has there been a horror movie in the past 5 or 10 years that has made you cringe and yell out, "Oh my god?!"  I think Hostel has really been the only one I can think of.  And maybe Event Horizon to an extent.</p><p>Why aren't movies this bold anymore?</p><p>Actually, now that I think of it...  Asian torture films as of late have been quite brutal.  Audition was one of the most difficult films to stomach (so to speak).  That film is painful.  Maybe I should watch more of those...</p><div class='title'><b>Moog!</b></div><p>Besides the unbridled gore, wacky retro outfits and attitudes, Xtro has an amazing soundtrack.  In fitting with the late 70s, early 80s, the score is entirely composed with a Moog Synthesizer.  The Moog synth is vital in setting the tone of the movie consistent with the era in which is was produced.  A very organic sound with an outright alien tynch.  Atmospheric tone standing on the brink of technology.</p><p>Xtro is bizarre enough for me to love to begin with, but the beautiful crafted soundtrack keeps me locked in with the experience.</p><div class='title'><b>The end...?</b></div><p>The ending of the <b>Xtro</b> is left open.  There are some alternate endings on the DVD, but ultimately the alien eggs hatch and you're left to figure out what happens next.</p><p>There are two sequels following Xtro, but have absolutely nothing to do with the original movie, nor each other.  Both sequels feature military teams combating an alien menace.  Xtro 2 (released in 1990) is an Alien ripoff, and Xtro 3 (released in 1995) is a Predator ripoff.  Both films are god awful.  Neither has nudity.  Neither has grotesque horror.</p><p>Everything unique about Xtro 1 was completely generic in its sequels.  The story.  The characters.  The setting.  The action.  The circumstances.  The music.</p><p>Xtro 1 was pretty low budget, but they made up for it with imagery you'd never see anywhere else.  Xtro 2 and 3 are wannabe copies of blockbuster films that try to bring the franchise back into reality.  They are not bold, nor eye catching.  They are sad imitations that I regret ever watching.</p><p>Anyways, definitely check out <b>Xtro</b> on Netflix, but forget about the sequels.</p><p>Also, I swiped that Clip from <a href="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/" title="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/">Badmovies.org's Review of Xtro</a>.  Check out that site for more pictures, quotes, and their own review. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dexter" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dexter-2">Dexter</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dexter Discussion Spoiler Free!</b></div><p>I just finished watching Season 1 of Dexter for the second time. It's quite incredible. The suspense is perfectly controlled leading to the finale. It builds from the little bits of plot and story peppered in the beginning and gradually mounting an explosion in the end.</p><p>Season 2 really doesn't quite compare. Though, it tries to do the same thing. And has a pretty decent starting point with the aftermath of Season 1. It does a great job of building off the previous season and builds a story of its own, which also leads to a great ending. Unfortunately, the main focus is split.</p><p>Season 1 has a very clear focal point that everything centers on. There are 2 main plots that eventually weave together into one. Season 2 has a focal point, but there is too much plot. And just a little bit of story. Thankfully it's masked but consistant suspense.</p><p>Season 2 is still decent, but Season 1 is great.</p><p>Don't talk to me about Season 3.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Day The Earth Stood Still" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-day-the-earth-stood-still">The Day The Earth Stood Still</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 15, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In 1951, The Day The Earth Stood Still meant something.  The Earth was done with it's Second World War, but the aftermath left the world in conspiracy and distrust.  With the world so completely torn apart, what <em>would</em> happen if we were visited by alien life?  Alien Life clearly more powerful than us and whose intentions are unknown?</p><p>Klaatu comes to Earth to let us know that our hostile ways will not be tolerated.  The Universe has learned the consequences of aggression and war and that peace is the solution.  But Klaatu is met with opposition, restrainment, and eventually death.  Klaatu is revived and presents his ultimatum to earth.  You can fight amongst yourselves, but aggressive against other planets will result in your planet's destruction.</p><p>1951 was the perfect time for a message to mean something.  6 years prior, the Atomic Bomb detention in Hiroshima and Nagasaki showed the Earth how destructive we can be to our own people and our own planet.  At that time, everyone was scared it would occur again.</p><p>In 2008, we've arrived at a different message.  We're killing our planet.  Humanity has proven too irresponsible to exist on Earth and must be removed.  There are so few planets in the Universe that can sustain complex life.  It's been decided that the Earth cannot be lost.</p><p>This message would probably be "profound" if it wasn't already being broadcasted everywhere we look.  Being Green, Hybrid Vehicles, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.  I think we're already in consensus that we should stop trashing our planet.</p><p>In 1951, the message of the film was controversial.  Anti-Communism movements were rampant in the US.  It was us versus them.  The film broke those boundaries.  In fact, the National Film Registry has preserved the film as being "culturally, historically, and aesthetically <b>significant</b>" according to wikipedia.  The Day The Earth Stood Still meant something.</p><p>2008's The Day The Earth Stood Still is simply preaching to the choir and thus means nothing.</p><div class='title'><b>In Addition...</b></div><p>In Addition, 2008's Day the Earth Stood Still tries to be too many movies at once.  It tries to be Sci Fi and Disaster and Thriller and critique humanity at the same time.  The movie is completely split between the US Government trying to disect Gort while Keanu Klaatu runs around with Jennifer Connely learning about humanity and vading the cops.</p><p>It tried to cover way too many angles and became a gobbled mess by the end.</p><div class='title'><b>On the other hand...</b></div><p>On the other hand, though, I thought the Sci Fi elements of the movie were pretty rad.  2008 Gort is amazing.  Klaatu's spacesuit shell and healing properties were neat, too.  Though, the electricity powers were a little much.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/terminator-sarah-connor-chronicles-thoughts">Terminator: Sarah Connor Chronicles Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last month I've been sitting on the first two Blurays of the Terminator television program, Sarah Connor Chronicles.  I think the Xbox is largely to blame for that, but I finally switched back to my Playstation 3 and started watching.</p><p>Honestly, I think this show is pretty dumb.  The humor solely relies on Summer Glau acting inhuman because she's a robot.  And the show comes off as shallow because it relies too much on the action which isn't all that good because it has a Television show budget.  The humor and the action try way too hard to live up to Terminator 2.</p><p>And the unforgivable plot device used in the pilot episode completely breaks the mythos of Terminator.  YOU CANNOT travel forward in time.  Only backwards.  I'm sure fanboys were completely up in arms on the Internet after that aired.  Messing around with time is a dangerous plot device that I think Terminator skirted by only allowing backwards time travel.</p><p>Even after that travesty, I continued watching the show because...  well, I had the discs and wanted to return them to Netflix.</p><p>But some goods things have come out of the show after watching the first six episodes.  After having some time to think about it, my opinion isn't as harsh as it initially was.  I'm still on record as saying it's dumb, though, so I have my bases covered...</p><div class='title'><b>Alternative Missions</b></div><p>In each Terminator movie the plot was exactly the same.  Skynet sends back an evil terminator back in time with the mission to (effectively) kill John Connor, the future leader of the resistance.  Future John Connor, sends back a force of good, whether it be a good terminator (Arnold) or a resistance fighter (Kyle Reese) in order to save John Connor's life from the terminator.</p><p>That's pretty much the plot of the pilot episode, but afterward they run into other terminator with missions that didn't involve killing John Connor what's so ever.  In fact, they weren't really even programmed to know what John Connor looked like.  So, Connor could walk right by one and it wouldn't ever matter.  Of course, if these Terminators realized that this is John Connor, they would kill him.</p><p>Anyways, for example, one such mission was to gather Caltec (?) Alloy which is the base material for creating the Terminator Endo-skeletons.  The mission was to gather this stuff, bring it to this specific location and await further instructions.  The Terminator completely this mission and stood by the door awaiting further instructions.  His wait instructions was something like this...<br/><pre>while(door not open && not interrupted) {    wait(15000); }</pre><br/>Honestly, no one would really be coming to this specific location until after the machine war broke out.  So the Terminator would be completely standing still there for 5 straight years.  That's computer logic for ya.</p><div class='title'><b>Time Travel Semantics</b></div><p>Traveling through time in the Terminator Universe will transport to a different time, but you'll be in the exact same position on earth.  I guess that makes sense.  That's also how it works in Back to the Future and other time traveling movies.  It doesn't work that way in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure though.</p><div class='title'><b>Survival Instincts</b></div><p>In the first episode, they "destroy" the evil Terminator and travel in the future 8 years.  But, what d'ya know, the Terminator actually survived, but has been beat to shit.  The Terminator lies in pieces around the scene at which he thought he killed Sarah and John Connor, but they really went into the future.  8 years later, they appear and the Terminator gets a second wind.</p><p>This Terminator, whom they've named Cromartie, has had its head blown off and flesh completely rotted away.  So he must find his head, but still blend in with humans.  He finds his head, but must create a new skin for himself.  So he finds some scientist and gives him the formula to create the skin.  So now he has skin, but he looks like the Toxic Avenger.  So, he finds a reconstructive surgeon to make him look like an actual person.</p><p>Rather than just going directly after John Connor, Cromartie is rebuilding himself and camouflages himself to accomplish his mission.  He realizes his limitations and must adapt.  I wonder if this is what the Terminators in the future realized after some time fighting the humans.  You can't win head on.  You need to deceive to conquer.  And even then it doesn't really work all that well.<br/>____</p><p>Anyways, I'm excited to see how the first season ends.  Though, I'll probably be dissappointed.  I keep forgetting that the whole Terminator mythos is one that puts Action first, and other things second.  Hopefully, they'll keep building up the mythos with these little tidbits rather than trying to make "awesome" action sequences.</p><p>We'll see though...  The second season has already begun!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Via Domus" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus">Lost Via Domus</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><i><b>Lost Via Domus Spoliers</b></i></p><p>You'd think a television show such as Lost would be above whoring itself out to sell a couple of bucks but here are.  I'm pretty sure ABC owns the actual rights to the Lost name, or else this game probably would not have been made.  But after spending the afternoon with Lost Via Domus on Xbox, starting at Noon and finishing around 5:30pm, I'm glad it was made.</p><p>Lost Via Domus is a pretty decently put together fan fiction spanning 7 episodes taking place during Seasons 1 and 2 of Lost.  Each episode lasts about 30 to 45 minutes and centers on main character, Elliot Maslow.  Elliot finds himself on the island with no memory of the past and a mysterious man out to kill him.  Inklings of his past start to trickle back to him, when Lost characters confront him about his past.  Elliot must piece together his past in flashbacks while using this information in the present to progress further.</p><p>The writers of Lost Via Domus have a very good grasp of Lost lore.  Each Lost character confronts and deals with Elliot and his problems in a very stereotypical way for their character.  Jack doesn't believe you.  Sawyer doesn't care.  Hurley's your buddy.  Locke leads Elliot through the woods to find himself.  Michael yells Walt a couple times.</p><p>Each episode is meant to take place during the storyline of Lost, but in time breaks it and then breaks it completely wide open.  In the beginning, I was completely with Elliot fitting into Lost.  His character was out of the real story and in his own.  But eventually, Elliot starts to do things that he shouldn't be doing.  Like opening and closing blast doors from inside the hatch.  And using dynamite to blow open a secret area of the Swan hatch and neutralize the magnetic reactor.</p><p>The story does not fit into Lost, but the themes and style are pretty well put together and are very Lost.  The themes of your past eventually confront yourself on the island, and you have the choice to diverge from those themes and learn from the past, or doom yourself to repeat it.</p><p>Aside from that, the environment and graphics are absolutely beautiful though.  If you've ever wanted to walk around on the set of Lost, all you need to do is pick up this game.  You walk around the beach, the Swan hatch, the Hydra station, the Flame station.  You can even find the mediical "Staff" station and "Pearl" station to walk around to, if you can find them.  Each setting is absolutely perfect in the game, and taking pictures of various Lost props gets you achievement points.</p><p>Overall, I think Lost Via Domus is a very unique gaming anomaly.  It's an interactive fan-fiction totally made by and for Lost fans.  As a Lost fan, I can respect this product and think it succeeds at its goals.  As a gamer, the game isn't really all that bad.  It's well put together, but very simple.  If this game had a story completely of its own, I would probably like it on its own and look forward to what the team was doing next.</p><p>But, even after all these kind words, I would recommend it as a <b>rental only for Lost fans</b>.  Once you finish it, that's it.  It's just 7 episodes of fan-fiction...  nothing more.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Heath Ledger's Joker" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/heath-ledgers-joker">Heath Ledger's Joker</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Not the casting call, but Ledger's acting job,  it's Fricken incredible.</p><p>I found it really interesting that Nolan intentionally neglected to provide an back story for The Joker.  I'm sure it was the exact same case for the criminals of Gotham when Batman appeared.  One day, he just showed up and completely ruined everything for them.  One day, this day, Joker just showed up and changed the equation again.</p><p>He's not just some super villain for Batman to fight in another Batman movie..  he's a true nemesis.  He exists because Batman exists.  There's no other reason to Joker's plot or ambition.  It's just to put wrong with what is right.  To play around with society and knock it off it's tracks.</p><p>Everything else in the movie was muted compared to Joker.  Everyone else took backstage and I really didn't care about them because Joker cast such dark shadow of their acting abilities.  Why the hell does Bale talk like he's coughing as Batman anyways?  Dent completely changed character so fast after becoming Two-Face..  yeah yeah, he's two-faced, but he went to killing cops kinda fast.  Gary Oldman was fantastic as Gordon, but his character whispers all the time and doesn't stand out.</p><p>It's a truly sad affair that Heath Ledger killed himself earlier in the year with a drug overdose.  All that potential and brilliance is completely gone now, but I guess it doesn't matter.  It puts his performance completely stand-alone in the series.  Between both movies, this feels like the climax of the entire new Batman movie series.  What other super-villian could come along and mean more to the series as Joker?  Mr. Freeze?  Poison Ivy?</p><p>I think Nolan has outdone himself, and even though they are working on the next Batman movie already, how can it really compare?  This first movie looks silly compared to this thanks to the Joker.</p><p>Joker, Joker, Joker..  that's all Dark Knight really is to me.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to It's all melting around me" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me">It's all melting around me</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 15, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>In the mail today, Netflix graciously delivered <b>House of Wax</b>.  That 2006 piece of shit horror movie with Paris Hilton and a supporting actress.  I'm not really sure how it snuck itself all the way to first place in my queue, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and sat through the entire thing.  To be fair, I did have the things on 1.5x Play to make sure I only wasted an hour, rather than an hour and a half.</p><p>My expectations were pretty simple..  I knew this film was garbage.  I expected garbage.  But House of Wax still managed to disappoint me and fail my expectations.</p><p>Though it did not fail my expectations as badly as Nintendo and Sony had today.  For this week is E3, the Electronics Entertainment Expo is Los Angeles.  The event that has set itself as a milestone in game development and allows companies to show what they have accomplished and what big things they have in store for gamers in the coming fall and Christmas season.</p><p>Yesterday, Microsoft had some great announcements such as a new 60 gb Xbox 360 coming out in a couple of weeks to replace the 20gb.  The harddrive expansion should help out a bit since another announcement was that you can install full Xbox 360 games onto your harddrive for far faster loading.  EVEN bigger news was that Microsoft has teamed with Netflix to stream "Watch Instantly" titles directly to your Xbox 360 if you have a Netflix subscription and an xbox live gold subscription.</p><p>They also showed off some of there games namely <b>Gears of War 2</b> (dumb) and <b>Fable 2</b> (sweet!) and ended their conference announcing that Final Fantasy XIII will be coming to the Xbox 360 in America.  This news literally broke some corners of the internet..  namely neogaf.  Squaresoft held a Q&A session afterward where everyone wanted to know the details.</p><p>The Xbox is looking quite lucrative..  Even before the conference, Fable 2 was really the only next-gen game that interested me this Fall and with the Netflix integration and new 60gb models, I'll be in line that mid-August morning to pick one up.  Hopefully there'll be some sort of sale..</p><p>That's fine for the Xbox though, but I'm MORE interested in the game consoles I own.  I've owned a Wii for well over a year now, and in the last 3 months I haven't even touched it.  There's nothing on the Wii I want to play right now, and nothing down the pipeline either.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same is with the Playstation 3.  I bought that thing about a month ago, loved Metal Gear Solid 4 to death, and now all I do with it is play DVDs and Blurays.  There's nothing on the Playstation 3 coming down the pipeline I want that I wouldn't have a better time with on the 360.  Any multi-platform titles that has a smidgen of Online functionality, I will choose the Xbox version because I have MORE friends with Xboxes and it's MUCH easier to join games with them.  <b>Ghostbusters</b> has Online co-op?  Xbox purchase.  <b>Resident Evil 5</b> has Online Co-op?  Most likely Xbox purchase.</p><p>SO, that made me quite excited for this morning when Nintendo and Sony had their E3 press conferences and I feverishly waited for a megaton announcement to rival the Final Fantasy XIII on Xbox announcement yesterday.  In fact, I popped up the live video to listen to while I worked rather than just looking at the news pouring in from sites.</p><p>The first conference of the day was Nintendo.  They showed off a snowboarding game with the Wii Balance Board, then<b> Animal Crossing</b>, then some DS games..  Then they showed off <b>Wii Sports Resort</b> (Wii Sports 2), which I thought was pretty damn important for them.  It'll definitely sell a ton of copies since everyone knows and loves Wii Sports.  I was somewhat excited for them, but for me..  who cares?  It's just another collection of Wii mini-games to go along with all the other top-selling games on the Wii.  Then they announced <b>Wii Music</b>, which was laughable.</p><p>And that was it...  Iwata mentioned that the Zelda and Mario teams are hard at work on new Wii titles, but gave absolutely no hint as to what those titles are, nor when we know of them.  All the games shown for Wii were more crappy mini-game compliations and Animal Crossing, which is an MMO chat room furniture collection game I've already played to death on the gamecube.  Frakking bullshit.</p><p>I shrugged it off though..  my Wii is kinda broken now anyways, and my monitor only accepts digital signals, so the Wii looks like crap on it.  I've been setting my sights on HiDef gaming more recently so bring on the good news Sony!</p><p>Nearly 2 hours later, the Sony conference began and I sat listening to Jack Trenton talk and talk and talk.  <b>Yakuza 2</b> (on PS2) got a little face time in the Playstation 2 trailer, which made me happy.  That's another game coming out this fall that I've been waiting for.  Trenton unveiled PSN movie rentals which was the biggest joke after Microsoft announced its Netflix partnership the day earlier.</p><p>He also announced that they have 130 titles coming to PS2 by the end of the year...  That's a lot more than they have for the Playstation 3.  Obviously the Playstation 2 has a huge attach rate, but it's time to move on.  Focus on the Playstation 3 because the Xbox hit 5 or 6 home runs just yesterday, not to mention all the blockbuster releases last year.  Metal Gear is all you have going for you and Microsoft has shown that it doesn't need it.</p><p>An hour into the conference and they finally get to showing off the upcoming games for Playstation 3.  Sony officially announces God of War 3 (boring), they show off some other game, and unveil MAG, a 256 player war simulator.  Another fucking war game...  and that's the show.</p><p>Once again, absolutely nothing that appeals to me at all..  No immersive single player experience that will have me loving video games the way Twilight Princess, Mario Galaxy and Metal Gear Solid 4 have.  Resident Evil 5 will probably fill that bill, but Sony didn't give any face time to it.  Microsoft showed off a demo and gave a March 13th, 2009 date AND announced online co-op.</p><p>The future is grim for my interest in these two consoles in the next year.  There's still whatever game the Zelda and Mario teams are working on for the Wii (<b>Kid Icarus</b>).  And there's <b>Yakuza Kenzan</b> and <b>Yakuza 3</b> for Playstation 3, but haven't been announced for an American release.</p><p>The Xbox has Fable 2 coming out in October, and huge multi-million-dollar-deal DLC for Grand Theft Auto 4.  Probably some Mass Effect DLC once Bioware finishes Dragon Age.  There's also Galaga Legions from the creators of Pacman CE.  AND Online Co-op for Ghostbusters with friends!</p><p>I really feel that once I actually get an Xbox, my other two consoles will just sit there, against the wall.. especially the Wii.  The Playstation 3 I'll use for Blu-ray and upscaling Playstation 2 games.</p><p>There's not a whole lot of redeeming qualities..  much like House of Wax.  For a horror movie, there's NO nudity.. what the crap?!  The acting goes from bad to worse to slap-in-the-face horrible.  However, in the end, the main characters set the House of Wax on fire and frantically escape as it turns into a boiling molten pit of fire and craziness.  Also, Paris Hilton dies.  House of Wax will always have that over the Nintendo and Sony conferences.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Speed Racer is Amazing" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/speed-racer-is-amazing">Speed Racer is Amazing</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 10, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I went down to Freeport this weekend to see Speed Racer with Erika and Stephen and was blown away.  I think the Wachowski brother nailed the intensity of racing with the fast paced cuts and transitions of Anime and lit everything together with THE most brilliant and vibrant colors I've ever seen it a movie.</p><p>I think it's one of the few movies to actually bring live action elements into the cartoon world, rather bringing its characters into the real world.  I reminds me a lot of Dick Tracy and The Flintstones, rather than Batman or Spiderman.  The characters and their environment are completely in sync, rather than some goofy cartoon logic in our own world.</p><p>Critics seem to be pissed about this though saying the movie is sensory overload disconnected from reality.  That's exactly what it is.  What did you think it was going to be?  How is that fact a downfall?  Critics are killing this movie in the same way they did with Matrix Reloaded.  They expect one thing... and get something else.</p><p>Honestly, I think when the Wachowskis ground themselves in reality, the results are horrible.. like V for Vendetta.</p><p>Unfortunately, the critics get their way since Speed Racer flopped taking in only $20.2 million this weekend, a percentage compared to Iron Man's opening $100 million weekend and another $50 million this weekend.</p><p>I loved every minute of this minute and can't wait to see it again.  Next time, it'll be at the Imax.  If you hate the movie because its crazy, then you're too old.</p><p>Also, I'm disapointed in Mathew Fox.  He has absolutely no acting range and will always be known as Jack from Lost.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to 2008 Summer Movies" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/2008-summer-movies">2008 Summer Movies</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This summer is huge for movies and there are a bunch I'm particularly interested in.<br/>___</p><p>April 18th - <b>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</b><br/><a href="http://www.forgettingsarahmarshall.com/" title="http://www.forgettingsarahmarshall.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800039/">Imdb</a></p><p>Written and Starring Jason Segal, one of the vets from Apatow Productions, plays opposite Kristen Bell who break up in the beginning of the movie and Segal goes to great lengths to forget her and fails miserable.  The ads on TV don't really paint this movie in a fantatic light, but that was the same for Knocked Up and Superbad.  I guess we'll see.<br/>___</p><p>May 2nd - <b>Iron Man</b><br/><a href="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/" title="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371746/">Imdb</a><br/>___</p><p>May 9th - <b>Speed Racer</b><br/><a href="http://speedracerthemovie.warnerbros.com/" title="http://speedracerthemovie.warnerbros.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811080/">Imdb</a></p><p>I've been hyped up for this movie ever since I saw the first images and trailer.  This is the kind of movie that hype lends rather well because you know exactly what to expect from it.  Sweet sweet eye candy.  Speed Racer looks absolutely amazing, full of vibrant colors and life, fast paced action in a very anime style.  And with the wachowski brothers at the helm, this movie won't fail at those points.</p><p>I have no doubts the story will be utter crap, acting may be poor, and the whole family-centered attitude will constantly annoy me, but the action will probably make up for it.  I'm psyched.<br/>___</p><p>May 22nd - <b>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</b><br/><a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/indianajones.html" title="http://movies.yahoo.com/feature/indianajones.html">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/">Imdb</a><br/>___</p><p>June 13th - <b>The Incredible Hulk</b><br/><a href="http://incrediblehulk.marvel.com/" title="http://incrediblehulk.marvel.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/">Imdb</a></p><p>I dunno... I'll probably see this movie if other people are going.  The previous Hulk movie was rather horrible, but this new Hulk stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner.  That along makes it worth viewing, in my opinion.<br/>___</p><p>July 2nd - <b>Hancock</b><br/><a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/hancock/" title="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony_pictures/hancock/">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/">Imdb</a></p><p>Hancock looks absolutely hilarious.  Will Smith plays a bum with super-powers and doesn't care about the damage caused by "Saving the Day".  Eventually Will Smith runs into Jason Bateman who tries to reabilitate him into a stereotypical do-gooder.  Or something like that.  Check out the trailer.<br/>___</p><p>July 18th - <b>The Dark Knight</b><br/><a href="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/" title="http://thedarkknight.warnerbros.com/">Official Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/">Imdb</a></p><p>The long-time hyped sequel to Batman Begins and the "remake" of the original 1989 Batman movie, pits Batman versus The Joker.  huzzah.<br/>___</p><p>August 8th - <b>Pineapple Express</b><br/><a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/pineappleexpress/index.html" title="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/pineappleexpress/index.html">Official-ish Site</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910936/" title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910936/">Imdb</a></p><p>Written and Starring Seth Rogan who plays a regular old guy buying some pot from dealer James Franco when they witness a murder.  Then the murderers are after Seth and James and they cops think they did it, so they're being chased by everyone while trying to clear their names.<br/>___</p><p>August 28th - Chuck Palahniuk's <b>Choke</b><br/><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt1024715/" title="http://imdb.com/title/tt1024715/">Imdb</a></p><p>Really?  Is this movie really finally coming out?  Imdb has some pretty slick character photos of the cast so that's some great signs that this might actually finally come out.</p><p>It's been 9 years since Fight Club hit theaters and became an instant cult classic.  Fight Club made me a huge fan of Chuck Palahniuk, and Choke was the first book I read of his.  I'm very excited to see if Choke will bring some more amazing things to film like what Fight Club brought.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/film/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/film/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
