| October 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Tuesday, Fable II finally is released.  A game that I was once very much looking forward to.  But the more and more of this game I expose myself to, the more and more I cannot bring myself to hand over $60 or $70 dollars to purchase.</p><div class='title'><b>Thinking back to Fable</b></div><p>Fable was one of my favorite original Xbox games.  I have that thought in my head.  I really liked Fable.  But, why did I like Fable?  Oh right.  Because the game was completely ridiculous.  Because the English accents made me laugh every time dialogue was spoken.  Because I ate a bunch of pies and ran around as a huge fat guy.</p><p>I loved it for it's B-movie qualities.  There were plenty of them.  But that's really the extent of Fable's quality.  The game is shallow and tedious, quite frankly.  It made me laugh because it was so moronic.</p><p>Would I pay $60 or $70 to be amused again by the same train wreck?  Hell no.  The memories are fond, but only because the price of entry was trivial.  I think I paid $20 for Fable and It was absolutely worth it.  Another Fable-like experience is not worth the high price of HD gaming.  It's worth $30 at best.</p><div class='title'><b>Playing Fable at PAX</b></div><p>But times change, right?  Peter Moyneux (creator of Fable) has apologized for the mistakes made in Fable and says that he's learned from them.  Fable II is fable done right.  Honestly, there are tons of problems with what I played at The Penny Arcade Expo, if that was representative of the final product: <a href="/old/v7/pax-fable-ii-hands-on" title="/pax-fable-ii-hands-on">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=476</a></p><p>The graphics were horrible.  The speed was slow.  The fighting felt a tad unresponsive.  It also felt more like a hack 'n slash loot fest than an Action RPG.  And that'd be fine if I found it fun to play.  But what I played was boring and derivative.  It took resolve to make it to the end of the demo.  And I'm not going to pay $60 - $70 to play more of that shit.</p><div class='title'><b>The first 10 minutes</b></div><p>Kotaku posted an article today with a video of the first 10 minutes of Fable 2.  Some polish website has a copy of the game committed it to the internet: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish" title="http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish">http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish</a></p><p>That certainly brings back memories from Fable.  The goofy English accents and dim-witted humor.  But after playing Dead Space all weekend long, this feels cheap.  It feels like a joke.  And I'd feel like I'm at the butt of that joke for paying full price.  Dead Space is a fine polished work of atmospheric art.  Fable II looks bargin bin.</p><div class='title'><b>However...</b></div><p>One thing Fable II does have going for it is Online Co-op.  All my friends are interested in this game and have pre-ordered it.  So it gives me the chance to play games with friends!  I'm just going to clear out my gamefly list and have Fable II as the only entry.  That should guarantee that my next game will be Fable II and hopefully my friends haven't beaten the game by the time I get it.</p><p>Hell, If Fable II turns out to be alright.  I can choose the "keep it" option from Gamefly, and it'll only cost me $30, most likely.</p><div class='title'><b>Other upcoming games</b></div><p>As inferred, I bought Dead Space this week and Love it.  This week is Fable II.  Also this week is the new Castlevania on DS.  Next week is Fallout 3.  November 11th is Mirror's Edge!</p><p>I can't wait for Mirror's Edge ^_^.  I wrote about it back on <a href="/old/v7/free-running-game" title="/free-running-game">July 17th</a> during E3 week and then played it on <a href="/old/v7/pax-mirrors-edge-hands-on" title="/pax-mirrors-edge-hands-on">September 1st</a> at PAX.  On November 6th, they will be a demo on both consoles.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Via Domus" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus">Lost Via Domus</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 24, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p><i><b>Lost Via Domus Spoliers</b></i></p><p>You'd think a television show such as Lost would be above whoring itself out to sell a couple of bucks but here are.  I'm pretty sure ABC owns the actual rights to the Lost name, or else this game probably would not have been made.  But after spending the afternoon with Lost Via Domus on Xbox, starting at Noon and finishing around 5:30pm, I'm glad it was made.</p><p>Lost Via Domus is a pretty decently put together fan fiction spanning 7 episodes taking place during Seasons 1 and 2 of Lost.  Each episode lasts about 30 to 45 minutes and centers on main character, Elliot Maslow.  Elliot finds himself on the island with no memory of the past and a mysterious man out to kill him.  Inklings of his past start to trickle back to him, when Lost characters confront him about his past.  Elliot must piece together his past in flashbacks while using this information in the present to progress further.</p><p>The writers of Lost Via Domus have a very good grasp of Lost lore.  Each Lost character confronts and deals with Elliot and his problems in a very stereotypical way for their character.  Jack doesn't believe you.  Sawyer doesn't care.  Hurley's your buddy.  Locke leads Elliot through the woods to find himself.  Michael yells Walt a couple times.</p><p>Each episode is meant to take place during the storyline of Lost, but in time breaks it and then breaks it completely wide open.  In the beginning, I was completely with Elliot fitting into Lost.  His character was out of the real story and in his own.  But eventually, Elliot starts to do things that he shouldn't be doing.  Like opening and closing blast doors from inside the hatch.  And using dynamite to blow open a secret area of the Swan hatch and neutralize the magnetic reactor.</p><p>The story does not fit into Lost, but the themes and style are pretty well put together and are very Lost.  The themes of your past eventually confront yourself on the island, and you have the choice to diverge from those themes and learn from the past, or doom yourself to repeat it.</p><p>Aside from that, the environment and graphics are absolutely beautiful though.  If you've ever wanted to walk around on the set of Lost, all you need to do is pick up this game.  You walk around the beach, the Swan hatch, the Hydra station, the Flame station.  You can even find the mediical "Staff" station and "Pearl" station to walk around to, if you can find them.  Each setting is absolutely perfect in the game, and taking pictures of various Lost props gets you achievement points.</p><p>Overall, I think Lost Via Domus is a very unique gaming anomaly.  It's an interactive fan-fiction totally made by and for Lost fans.  As a Lost fan, I can respect this product and think it succeeds at its goals.  As a gamer, the game isn't really all that bad.  It's well put together, but very simple.  If this game had a story completely of its own, I would probably like it on its own and look forward to what the team was doing next.</p><p>But, even after all these kind words, I would recommend it as a <b>rental only for Lost fans</b>.  Once you finish it, that's it.  It's just 7 episodes of fan-fiction...  nothing more.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Braid" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/braid">Braid</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Braid Spoilers</b></div><p>Braid is a puzzle-platformer for the Xbox Arcade in which you play Tim.  The world is split up into 6 worlds in which you use Time as the main catalyst to advance and collect puzzle pieces.  The basic premise of the story is fairly standard at first.  Tim is looking for the princess, and with the completion of each world, is told the princess is in another castle.</p><p>On the surface that is all this game is.  Hopping, Skipping and Jumping.  Standard gameplay mechanics until you begin realizing your actions as the player.  You're killing endless amounts of these golems to achieve success.  To regain a puzzle piece piecing together a lost memory.  Once you've collected the pieces and assembled the puzzle, the memory is complete.  Yes, you have been here and these were your actions.</p><p>The next puzzle complete and the next puzzle complete.  You descend into madness searching for your lost princess.  Where is she?!  You are obsessed.  No one will stand in my way.  She is my princess and how dare you hide her from me.  Your senseless evil monsters will not win.  You can't win.  I am the true hero.</p><p>Thus it continues.  The senseless murder continues until it is complete.  You cannot find her in the present.  Your future is void without her.  The past is the key.  You've been using Time all along to find her.  It's time to go back to where it began.  That single night.</p><p>Backwards on that day with death following you.  When we worked together with the one goal of being reunited.  It was then when I finally reached your window and peered at you asleep that you screamed and ran.  I tried to catch up..  I tried to catch you.  And you tried to kill me.  You ran away.  But I will find you.  Nothing will come in my way.</p><p>There had to be something missing in all my memories.  Very hidden hints of something larger.  Those pesky stars in which I cheated to find.  With nearly all of them, I cannot only relive the event of that day, but change it slightly to obtain her.  And that is what I did.  And now all that is around me is on fire.  A smile crept onto my face.  But I had to ask myself, 'Is this what I thought happiness would be'?</p><p>____</p><p>Tim is a psycho.  The world that you control his actions appears like a cutesy little video game in Tim's eyes.  But what are his actions in real life.  How many doors have you broken into?  How many grizzly townfolk have you trampled?  How many kingdoms have you crumbled?  Does the princess even exist?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Assassin's Creed Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/assassins-creed-impressions">Assassin's Creed Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 16, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Assassin's Creed is pretty neat, but incredibly repetitive.</p><div class='title'><b>It's neat</b></div><p>It's neat because it takes a fast paced approach to Stealth killing, compared to Metal Gear Solid and Tenchu which believe that patience is your number one weapon when killing unnoticed.  The fast paced nature comes from the Free Running style of gameplay.  Just hold down the run button and the sprint button, and off you go.  You can run up to a wall to scale it, climb on top, and then jump from roof top to roof top.</p><p>It's also neat because of the incredible scale of the cities you're free running through.  When perched on top of a tower, you can see all the buildings of the entire city.  Then you can crawl back down the tower, hop along a bunch of roof tops to the next tower, climb to the top and actually feel like you've covered a significant amount of ground.</p><p>It's also neat because with this scale, comes crowds and crowds of people.  So many people that it can become difficult to run through the streets.  You'll either need to start knocking everybody down as you bolt through them or get knocked over yourself.</p><div class='title'><b>Scale and Speed</b></div><p>The sense of the scale and speed are the greatest accomplishments of the game I've experience so far, but with scale comes the question of how you fill it?  You need a lot of stuff to make these cities feel alive, and the best way to make 10 people look like 100 is to copy and paste 10 times.  Recycle models, assets, textures and place everything in the world randomly, but come back afterwards and start molding it so it actually works.</p><p>The physics and gameplay engine are KEY for creating a game like this.  The gameplay needs to be absolutely flexible to operate correctly no matter what is actually in the environment.  Back at PAX last year, when the lead designer was demoing Assassin's Creed, he said that that was exactly their goal.  He pulled out his dev kit and set up a bunch of objects in the environment for Altier to run across and jump around on.  It was pretty fluid, like the environment was pre-setup.  But then he started moving around a bunch of the objects put them in places where Altier obviously couldn't move the same way as before.  He ran Altier through the objects again, and he acted completely different, but still completely fluid.</p><p>That's a lot of how Assassin's Creed feels when you're running across the roof tops.  You look to your left and right and look for little foot holds or nearby roof tops to jump across to.  It doesn't take long for you to figure out just how far Altier can jump and what makes sense to latch on to.  It's really fun ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Over and over again</b></div><p>Each city feels like it's been setup in certain areas, but all the recycled textures and models make me feel like I'm walking through the set of a Flintstones cartoon.  There's that guy again..  Oh! There's that doorway again.  Thank GOD you have a radar you can set waypoints onto.</p><p>On top of that, you have about 20 or 30 tasks to do per mission, which limit themselves to either helping Citizens from bully guards, pickpocketing, eavesdropping or intimidating.  Once you do all the tasks, you bring your information to the local guild and he tells you where to assassinate your target.  You go there, kill him, return to the guild and mission complete.  Then you get to do it ALL OVER AGAIN.  Rinse and repeat.</p><p>I've spent 5 hours rescuing stupid citizens and gazing from towers and hardly anytime actually assassinating worth-while targets.  I'm more focused on the grueling tasks ahead of me than any amount of story.</p><div class='title'><b>Story Telling</b></div><p>And the story telling is crap because you aren't actually Altier.  All this running around killing people is completely senseless and meaningless because in the overall plotline it is wholly unimportant.  You're actually a guy named Desmond, who is the great-graet-great-etg-earg-erae-fga-g-grandson of Altier and you relive moments of your grand pappy's life through inherited memories.</p><p>The real question of the game is why do I give two shits about Altier.  They mention that to get to the useful memories of Altier you have to start at the beginning, but seriously?! can't we just skip through all the piece of crap side missions which are the same as all the other side missions where are the same as the ACTUAL missions.  Where's the fast forward button? ..</p><p>In the 5 hours I've been playing so far, I've had about 30 minutes of story outside of Altier and as Desmond and I'm so bored, I'd rather be beating up people in the past.  They have given me absolutely no incentive to care about anything that's going on.  Even though the "Desmond goes to the Past" thing is a clear rip-off of LOST.</p><div class='title'><b>Why?</b></div><p>Why am I playing this game?  Why should I care about Desmond?  Running around through the streets and roof tops is neat.  Looking off in the distance over a massive city that I can walk every inch of is neat.  But adding those two things together is a gameplay concept, not a game.  This story is going no where fast... How long is this game anyways?  When can I quit?</p><p>Also, I like pushing over ladies with pots on their heads.  I also like punching bums right in the jaw when they ask me for change.  It's a lot of fun messing with the AI in this game because they just can't win.  Pots?  That's a pushin'  Change? That's a stabbin'<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metal Gear Solid 4" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metal-gear-solid-4">Metal Gear Solid 4</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 14, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over a month ago, Metal Gear Solid 4 was release on the Playstation and over a month ago, I played the crap out of it.  I stood outside Wal*mart early in the morning and spent the $500 entry fee for a Playstation 3 and a copy of Metal Gear.  I played a little bit in the evening after work, but on that Saturday afternoon, I picked up the controller, and didn't set it down until I finished it the next day.  I was on my seat the whole time.  I was careful, but still raced through the gameplay to watch the next cutscene.  I had to see what happened next.</p><p>So far in this generation, I haven't felt anything this.  Every game I have liked on the Xbox may have had a decent story, but the characters are all so flat and vacant.  There's no emotional appeal what-so-ever.  You kill a bunch of enemies and the story progresses, but your character never explains how he feels about it.  You never show any weakness or compassion. Enemies are merely obstacles, gameplay elements, something to do until you see what happens next..  rather than seeing how your characters will react to what happens next.</p><p>The first bit of the game shows off the next gen nature of Metal Gear 4.  It pulls in new concepts of the series and sets the stage and themes Hideo Kojima wants to make with his game.  War is ugly and the only thing pushing War is the war economy.  Nations thrive from war and it's become a way of life for some people.</p><p>The overall story in Metal Gear Solid 4 is a very human tale.  Though, it does have its fair share of ridiculousness.  Metal Gear Solid is quite serious in the themes it presents, but once the game drifts from it's commentary on modern warfare to the actual plot of the Metal Gear series, little bits of crazy start seeping into the frame work.  Metal Gear starts off as one game and becomes another.</p><p>It becomes the absolute climax of Solid Snake's story bringing up points from Snake's past and MY own past playing Snake in the previous 3 games.  Remember when you did this?  It's relevant because of this.  Remember this person you met?  They're relevant because of this.  Each game has its purpose, and although Kojima wasn't thinking about all this at the time, they all set the stage for the finale of Metal Gear Solid 4.</p><p>This is really only part of the game though. But it's the most important part to me.  The complexity of the characters and the continuous tie-ins that bleed nostalgia kept me playing for those 14 hours until the final breathe of the game.</p><p>I am completely satisfied with my $500 purchase, but that doesn't mean Metal Gear is for everyone.  With Metal Gear, I wanted a linear experience.  Most games try to strive away from linearity claiming it's a bad thing.  If you're trying the represent reality, you must branch your story into many different directions which can splinter your focus and ultimately provide a stale experience.</p><p>In Grand Theft Auto's case, the story fails because of how inconsistent the gameplay is from the story.  In the beginning, Niko is just another guy trying to make a living.  However, if you play the game the way some of my friends do and try to kill as many people as possible before the cops kill you, the story falls apart fast when you get back to it and everyone is shocked when you kill a single person.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid does a bit of hand holding and several staged events that trigger when you walk to a certain point in the area.  The game is also filled with hours of cutscenes.  Overall, my initial experience was half-gameplay / half-cutscene.  It's literally 5 3-5 hour movies in one package, with some individual cutscenes well over the hour mark..  but you can save halfway through them.  You can also skip them too, except for one or two.</p><p>The story is also very much rooted in Metal Gear Solid lore. New-comers to the Metal Gear Solid series will definitely find themselves lost in the later chapters of the game and nostalgia will just wash over them.  This game is not really targeted towards new-comers at all and I don't imagine that a new-comer will actually like it either.  The target market is really the gaming community at large.  People that know games..  That's why the gaming press awards it with perfect scores.</p><div class='title'><b>Reviews</b></div><p>I'd imagine this makes Metal Gear rather difficult for most people to review because what do you actual focus on?  The gameplay is neat.  The graphics are beautiful.  The story is neat.  The story is brilliant to gamers.  Honestly, reviews are opinions and my opinion is stated above.  That is what affected me most when playing the game and that is what matters to me.  Metal Gear Solid 4 is the best game of this generation, in my opinion, and I don't think they'll be another game to top it, but it is clearly not for a wide audience.</p><p>If you see a review of this game that is absolutely void of emotion and doesn't even mention characters, you'll know what kind of gamer the author is...  like this fantastic gem for The Isthmus, Madison's weekly newspaper:</p><p><em> This is the solo-mission game to beat this summer, and it should be regarded as a great work of art.  You equip yourself with submachine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, a tranquilizer gun and hanguns, and you top them off with scopes, suppressors, lazer sights and rifle grips.  You need all those guns, because the year is 2014, and you are an old hero soldier who must shoot through heavily populated battlefields in the Middle East, Africa and beyond in a very long action-adventure where villains and their expendable troops are rising up to conquer territory</em></p><p><em> There are serious issues to ponder in the plot, which depicts a world at constant war.  Characters explore literary themes of mortality, individualism, the rise of machines and interpersonal relationships</em></p><p><em> Guns of the Patriot is pretty close to a masterpiece and contains some of the most addictive gaming of 2008.  Then you go online to find the same level of artistic detail accompanying multiplayer battlefields.</em> -Doug Elfman</p><p>This is a very stoic depiction of the game that reads like the back of the box.  In this game I do this and this and this.  There are guns and some type of story.  Apparently it's a long game, so I'm getting my money's worth.  There's also a multiplayer mode, so that'll keep me going after I beat it.  This isn't a review; it's a commercial.  He goes into length to describe all the types of guns without saying that each one has a distinct feel when you fire it.  NOT ONCE does he mention it's a sneaking game NOR that you can choose to take sides in the war.</p><p>The two sentences of actual opinion states it as "a work of art" and a "masterpiece" without giving supporting facts to why it is a "work of art" and a "masterpiece".  He knows there's something to it, but he can't quite put his finger on it..  better to talk about guns and what you do in the game rather than break the barriers of gaming and discuss it AS a work of art.  You know they're there because you mention "serious issues to ponder".  Does the fact they are literary make them a "masterpiece"?</p><p>I dunno..  despite how annoying this "review" is, this is really perfect for the audience of the Isthmus.  I think everyone should definitely give Metal Gear a shot and see for themselves what others regard as a masterpiece.  If I were writing this, Should I say that this game is not for everyone?  Disclaimer: Very linear story, lots of cutscenes, and heavy references to previous 3 games.  If the local paper decided to free up a tiny little portion for a game most of their audience doesn't care about..  Would you tell the audience, "this game isn't for you"?</p><p>Well, I think I would have to include that bit, but I'd also include how it made me feel and why I thinking it's the greatest thing ever..  because describing all the guns for the bulk of the article makes it sound like every other game, which Metal Gear Solid 4 is not.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Grand Theft Auto IV" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/grand-theft-auto-iv">Grand Theft Auto IV</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

One of my local Shopkos had a couple Special Editions left and after thinking about how well its being received, huge future add-ons rumored, and a large chunk of my friend's list playing it...  I thought it'd be a good idea to go with the flow.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" /></p><p>Though, upon picking it up this afternoon, I noticed that all other copies of GTA IV were sold out.  Sooo.. I guess it wasn't just a shot in the dark that Shopko had some special editions left.  They weren't purchased because it's ridiculously expensive.  The Special Edition is $30 more expensive than the already expensive price of next-gen games.</p><div class='title'><b>Special Edition Swag</b></div><p>Here's what $30 buys you:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" /></p><p>There's the lock-box with two keys, a Rockstar keychain, an artbook for GTAIV, an OST sampler, a Rockstar dufflebag, and the game.  The lock-box is pretty cool and it's somewhat sturdy, but if it were locked, I could easily rip the thing open.  It's not that sturdy, unfortunately.  The artbook doesn't provide a whole lot of insight.  The dufflebag is kinda cheap, but it's not bad.  It'll work great as a travel laundry bag or a gym bag.  Also, the keychain is pretty slick.</p><p>The special edition may be expensive but comes with a bunch of things.  If that CD isn't too bad, with the keychain and dufflebag, I'd say the $30 isn't that wasteful.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>I've only played about 3 or 4 hours so far, but I needed to take a break.  The controls make me feel like it's work to do anything in the game.  I don't want to drive anywhere because I feel like I'm driving through sand the entire time, which hinders everything I do in the game.  I can't chase people because they get away too fast and can't evade cops fast enough.  I feel like I'm dragging my feet the entire time.</p><p>That's the only thing problem I have with the game, thus far.  Unfortunately, it keeps me from having tons of fun, but I'm still having fun.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to WiiFit will not work on me" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wiifit-will-not-work-on-me">WiiFit will not work on me</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 17, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>.. and it especially won't with that attitude.</p><p>Today, Michael from Dubuque posted the following link in his livejournal: <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/wii-fit/" title="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/wii-fit/">The Great Experiment: Wii Fit</a>.  This is a weekly report by Eau Claire / No Brand Con legend Vinnk, in which every week he's been diligently using Wii Fit in an effort to lose weight and gain a better attitude towards exercise in general.</p><p>Looking at the results of this experiment, it worked amazing for him. ^_^.  <a href="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2008/04/02/the-great-experiment-wii-fit-%e2%80%93-final-report-or-how-i-lost-10-pounds-in-7-weeks-by-playing-video-games/" title="http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2008/04/02/the-great-experiment-wii-fit-%e2%80%93-final-report-or-how-i-lost-10-pounds-in-7-weeks-by-playing-video-games/">The Final Report</a> is proof of that.</p><p>Hey, that's great that WiiFit can guide people to a better, more fit life, but it's not going to work for me, nor many many other people that think it will.</p><div class='title'><b>8 years ago</b></div><p>In the year 2000, I was a chunky dude.  I'm not the fittest guy today, but back then I was far worse.  Then one of my friends introduced me to Dance Dance Revolution.  He had just gotten back from Japan and picked up DDR 3rd Mix new in stores.  I didn't buy the dance pads or anything gay like that..  I played on the controller and got to know the songs.  I liked it a lot.</p><p>DDR became one of my top favorite games and I continued to purchase the new ones as they came out.  Then college rolled around.</p><div class='title'><b>2002</b></div><p>I loved DDR, but I was a controller nut.  I never touched the pads because I felt too silly and stupid.  But like most major changes in my life, I met someone.  Darlene was both a geek and a dancer and started the first DDR Night at UW-Platteville, that I whole-heartily supported.  My feet had never touched the DDR pads, but using the controller was not an option for this night.  So I hopped on the pads for my first time and sucked horribly.</p><p>Everyone else really wondered how I sucked so bad when I had been playing the game for two years already.  The proof came at the end of the night when I picked up a controller and tapped away at it.</p><p>This was the beginning though...  She and I kept the DDR Nights coming and I played/practiced the game at least 2 hours a day.  I loved the music, the gameplay, and Darlene was the perfect partner to face off against and provided the perfect goal to reach towards.</p><p>As the months went on, the pounds shed off of me.  Foods and Drinks such as Pizza and Mt. Dew just didn't sit well in my stomach anymore.  It felt heavy and I couldn't consume such products anymore.  I switched to a lighter meal and juices and such.</p><p>In a matter of half a year, I was nearly 45 lbs lighter.  I was a rough 200 pounder when I first stepped on the pads, but by summer I had gotten so close to the 150 mark.  When I returned to my summer job, my co-workers thought I was sick or contracted some sort of illness..  only DANCE FEVER!!</p><div class='title'><b>The years went on</b></div><p>DDR Sunday Nights was one of the highlights of my week, along-side SPAMM and other college activities.  But attendance did falter a bit and DDR, as a series, really began to stale.  DDR kept continuing to climb in popularity but after DDR Extreme Japan was out there was a massive drought.  DDR Extreme USA sucked balls, and subsequent releases were no where near the callibur of Extreme Japan.</p><p>Darlene graduated in May 2004 and the Nights were difficult to get going with myself alone.  The Nights were revived along-side the ACM Thursday Night LAN parties, but that was the only time I played anymore.  And even some nights I didn't even play.. I just brought it with.</p><p>I was still eating right and walking everywhere and with my busy busy schedule, I had a huge amount of energy and DDR really helped me power through the last 2 years of college with gusto.  However, the only time I really got back into DDR was in Japan with DDR Supernova.</p><div class='title'><b>In retrospective...</b></div><p>Overall, DDR helped shaped my perspective of an active lifestyle.  I felt fit and had a ton of energy throughout my day.  I was eating better, too.  However, the pounds came back after I started working at Widen and had nothing to do with my time other than play games, watch movies and sit on my ass all day and work.  I don't really need a hell of a lot of energy because I'm not doing anything that needs it.  So, at the end of last year, I had pretty much returned to my pre-DDR weight.</p><p>Smashing my car actually helped a lot though, because now I'm forced to walk everywhere and somedays I walk rather far distances.  I usually make a bunch of phone calls while walking, so I'm never bored.  I'm down 15 to 20 on average and feel quite great.</p><p>Japan was a huge pyschology impact on "walking" for me because I know how much distance I'm capable of traveling.  Walking all the way from my office to the Capital of madison doesn't bother me at all..  That's like a drunken walk home from the bars in Sumiyoshi to me.  3 miles?  pfft..  I've done that nearly passing out before.</p><div class='title'><b>WiiFit</b></div><p>I think it's great that Vinnk has had a similar video game exercise experience, but there's no way it'll captivate me the way DDR did.  DDR's music was what interested me the most, not the weight-loss.  WiiFit is all weight-loss in a very stoic comparative fashion.</p><p>Brain Age was done in the EXACT same way.  I actually stuck with Brain Age 1 for longer than I bet most people did.  Almost a whole 2 months, actually.  I had an entry for every single day.. but it eventually died for me.  The same stupid mini-games every single day can wear very very fast.  The bite-sized 30 second tests are the real killer and that's all WiiFit is.</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">WiiFit won't work on me because it's more "Brain Training" except you're using your body rather than the stylus.  It's a gimmick that'll last maybe a month or two, and then take up dust in the corner.  This is definitely a great way to start a life of being fit, but if you don't have those hooks to keep you being fit after you've gotten bored of WiiFit, it's basically worthless and you'll gain all the weight back.</span><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Mass Effect - Bring down the Sky" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/mass-effect-bring-down-the-sky">Mass Effect - Bring down the Sky</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last week, Bioware released the first in a series of downloadable episodes for Mass Effect on the Xbox 360.  Being an adoring fan of Mass Effect I quickly purchased this new $5 episode and finally finished the 3 hour episode a week and a half later.</p><p>Bring down the Sky is a pluggable episode that squeezes itself into the middle of Mass Effect.  It takes place on Asteroid X57 near Terra Nova in the something cluster, which you can reach once you get free rein to explore the Milky Way Galaxy.  You can not access this once you've completed the game, which could be considered a pain in the ass to some players.  It took me about 3 or 4 hours to run through Eden Prime and all the required crap on the Citadel to finally start flying around.</p><p>That's the main reason why I didn't finish Bring down the Sky in one sitting.  All my free time that night was spent getting to the point where I could start it.  Also, I was playing on the insane difficulty, so some things took a little longer than usual.</p><p>In Bring down the Sky, you are faced with a Batarian regime who have taken over the science facilities on Asteroid X57 and have changed the trajectory to collide with Terra Nova, whose colonies consist of some 6 million inhabitants.  Once landed on the asteroid, you can see the brilliant Terra Nova as you loom closer to doom.  It reminds me a lot of Armageddon, actually.  Luckily, you don't need to drill through the surface and destroy the asteroid.  You just need to shut of the thrusters and regain control of the science facilities to fix everything.</p><p>This expansion does feature a couple new Assets to Mass Effect.  The large thrusters bored into the asteroid are new from the download, as well as the Batarians themselves.  We never did get to see the Batarians in the main game, but this expansion does offer reasons why they were left out.</p><p>Overall, Bring down the sky is more robust than the other side quests already in the game.  The experience is tighter and self-contained with actual cutscenes throughout the experience leading you on to the next station.  It has a more theatrical introduction and conclusion, but still keeps a sandbox approach to how you handle the outcome.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>The only complaint I have about Bring down the Sky is the ending.  It really annoys me that you are given 2 choices at the end and you can only do one or the other.  You cannot defeat the extremist leader AND save the hostages he's acquired.  You can do this in all other scenarios throughout the game, but you cannot in this one.  AND, to make matters worse, during the epilogue to the episode, everyone keeps second guessing your choices.</p><p>So, not only can't you do both, but the game judges either decision you make as the wrong one.  I even went back and saved the hostages the second time rather than killing the leader and they STILL are ungrateful.  ARHghaghghgh</p><p>You pay $5 for a few hours of entertainment and there's no scenario where the game won't complain about what you've done.  Maybe I'll go back and kill the hostages again just to shut them up.  At least I get Renegade points for that.. I don't get Paragon points for saving the hostages.<br/>/Spoilers</p><p>Anyways, I'd definitely recommend this if you like Mass Effect and have already completed one play through.  You don't need to beat the game to play this, but if you haven't finished Mass Effect, you should probably do that before you add more content to extend the game.</p><p>Also, Bring down the sky gives you another 50 achievement points ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Coming back to Mass Effect</b></div><p>Coming back into Mass Effect from playing World of Warcraft these past few months was a much needed breath of fresh air.  WOW is so completed void of emotion, it almost completely numbs me to play.  It has tremendous back story and all that, but that's not the point of WOW at all.  WOW is all about the end game level of play, reaching 70 and then actually building your character.  and continuing to build your character.</p><p>There's really no aspect of playing the game how you want because the point is to "be good" at it, and if you don't do little things how you're supposed, everyone starts complaining to you about it.  "You're in the wrong zone", "You're doing worthless quests", "Abandon all those crappy quests", "Put out your buffs", "Why do you have one point in another skill tree".</p><p>I feel no freedom in the game.  I'm really just a slave to how the game is played well.  Which is absolutely the opposite of what I want from an MMO.</p><p>Maybe it's just because I hang out with people who've played the game for the past 4 years its been in the market though, but I constantly miss the type of freedom I felt when playing Ultima Online.  I felt no pressure to do anything in Ultima Online.  I could just run off into the woods and be a hermit if I wanted.  I could build a shack in the woods, outfit it with fencer training stuff and buff my character that way.  I could actually explore the world where no one had ever been, and monsters were very sparse.</p><p>I really can't play World of Warcraft that much anymore..  It's too annoying and gives me a headache whenever I think about it.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, about Mass Effect</b></div><p>Anywho, I started a new game in Mass Effect to be able to play Bring down the Sky.  This is my third play through and I started off on my level 59 character, which was still 100,000 experience away from the game's level cap.  Through the first areas of the game I got up to 792,000, still 68,000 short of the cap.  After finishing the new episode I'm at 820,000, still 40,000 from the cap.  Sigh...</p><p>Also, my game is now on the Insane difficulty which is actually challenging!  It's actually pretty fun to actual use parts of the environment for cover and not being able to run in the middle of battle and kill everyone.  Each skirmish takes a little tact to fish out the enemies into the open to beat them down.  Moving around your party members is actually helpful!  Sweet.  Too bad is takes 50 hours into the game to unlock it.</p><p>I don't see why you have to unlock the more difficult difficulties when the options you have are pretty easy in the first place.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Apollo Justice - thought dump" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/apollo-justice-thought-dump">Apollo Justice - thought dump</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 9, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last Night, I completed Apollo Justice, the fourth game in the Ace Attorney / Phoenix Wright / Gyakuten Saiban game series.  I have some disappointments, but overall I'm quite pleased with the game.</p><p><b>Timeshift</b> (spoiler-heavy)</p><p>The riskiest thing about the game is playing as Apollo Justice, 7 years past the previous game.  This offers a very healthy restart to the franchise and takes the series in a new direction.  Honestly, I think they had exhausted all their options with Edgeworth and the Fey family.  It was time for the series to move forward, rather than backward.  But I think they put a little too much behind them when making this transition.</p><p>Phoenix Wright is in Apollo Justice and is the center of attention, but many of the other characters are gone.  Not a single mention of Edgeworth or the Fey Family.  No Franziska, No Gumshoe.  The only other 'blast from the past' is Ema Skye who was introduced in the DS only chapter of Phoenix Wright 1.  She has taken Gumshoe's place as lead detective.</p><p>I guess it's assumed that Edgeworth and Maya went their merry way elsewhere.  Pearl, too.  I'd like to know what happened.  Maybe that will be the focus of Gyakuten Saiban 5?</p><p><b>New Main Character</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>The thing reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 2.  Phoenix Wright is still in the game, but he's like a mentor / background character for the better part of the game.  It's not until the final chapter, when you play as him, that his whole story takes center stage and shows exactly how Apollo Justice is caught up in it.  Kinda like MGS2.  You start off as Snake, but his story is cut short.  Then all of sudden, you're playing as Raiden and have no idea why until it all becomes clear in the final act.</p><p>I have a feeling Gyakuten Saiban 5 is going to be a lot like MGS4 or perhaps Halo 3, where you have the main characters of the franchise side-by-side using their detective and analytic techniques together.</p><p><b>Perceiving</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>Speaking of which.. Phoenix Wright's detection vice was using the Magatama and discovering Psyche-Locks in people.  Locks that locked memories from the people view that you can unlock by shoving truth into their faces.  Unlocking those memories helped you dig deeper into the truth.</p><p>Apollo Justice has a vice of his own, Perceiving, which, just like the Magatama, is integral to his character's story.  To perceive, Apollo will feel tension in his bracelet which gives him the idea that this person is lying to him.  When perceiving, you look VERY closely at your subject.  You search them for a 'tell' or 'habit' they might do when they're lying.  Once you know exactly what they're lying about, you can use evidence or coercion to force the truth out of them.</p><p>In this game, the only time you perceive is in court.  There is never an instance outside of court that the game allows you to perceive.  But that's where the Magatama comes into play in the final act when uncovering all the mysteries of the past 7 years.</p><p><b>In the series..</b> (no real spoilers)</p><p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the game.  Even though, it missed the mark of the previous characters in the series, it did a great job pulling Apollo Justice and other new characters into the series.  I'm still somewhat annoyed at those chapters that aren't relevant to the overall story, though.  In this case, the second chapter really had nothing to do with the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  Though, I guess it did bring back Ema Skye and plenty of forensic investigation.</p><p>Placing it into the series, though.  I would say Apollo Justice is on par with the first Phoenix Wright game.  Phoenix Wright 3 is my favorite, whereas Phoenix Wright 2 is my least favorite.  Don't get me wrong, Phoenix Wright 2 is essential for the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban, but the music really pulls down the game.  You need to play Phoenix Wright 2 to appreciate all the story in Phoenix Wright 3.</p><p>Apollo Justice is kind of on its own plane though.  You don't really need to play the previous games to appreciate the story.  You could start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice and not be lost or miss anything.  All you'd really need to know is that Phoenix Wright is a good, clever lawyer.</p><p>Though, if you did start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice, you'd totally be spoiled by the 3D aspects.  I would rather hold Apollo Justice as a treat for playing through the first 3 games, than go start for the desert.</p><p><b>Gyakuten Saiban</b> (no spoilers)</p><p>After completing Apollo Justice, I still want more.  I love the characters, the story, the humor, the music.  The whole domestic version of the Gyakuten Saiban series is fantastic.  If you haven't played through them, I ask that you give it another try. ^_^  These 4 games are some of the best the DS has the offer.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 5 is at the top of my hype-wagon ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b><em>Update</em></b></div><p>After peering around, I found some news on Gyakuten Saiban 5.</p><p><em>When Shu Takumi was exclusively interviewed, he said that GS5 will still be on DS and it will be the last one for the series. However, it doesn't mean that there will be no new GS games, but rather the end of stories about Phoenix. After that, GS will become a totally new game and have nothing to do with the old series.</em></p><p><em>He also stated that GS4 was a "test" game. Thanks to the high sale record of GS4, the staff aren't worried about introducing a new story.</em></p><p><em>However, before the new game series can start, the current GS series must come to an end and GS5 will be the farewell show. GS5 will break the record of GS1's DS remake and become the longest one of the whole series. Almost all the old characters will turn up and some hidden clues in GS1234 will be looked on. Some of the cases which seem to have nothing to do with each other will show a connection. In a word, everything will become clear in GS5. What made the players even more excited, Shu Takumi revealed that the final boss of the all darkness is not a fresh face but someone we are quite familiar with! This person control all in the dark, who can he/she be?</em></p><p><em>Shu Takumi also said the most of the script has been finished and the game producing is on its way. There is also a piece of news which may let the players down: it's probably the last time that Shu Takumi will take part in writing the script for GS. From now on, other people will take over his work.</em></p><p>It seems like suspicions are correct.  Number 5 will tie everything together, but it seems it will also end it all.  Oh well.  Rather put a definite end to a story rather than dragging it out forever.  I can't wait ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Apollo Justice impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/apollo-justice-impressions">Apollo Justice impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Apollo Justice is the fourth game in the Phoenix Wright / Ace Attorney / Gyakuten Saiban series by Capcom and takes the series in a new direction for a couple different angles.</p><p>First off, It's the first game in the series to be specifically developed for the DS from the ground up.  All the other PW games were simply ports from the Gameboy Advance.  The first game did have a DS only chapter at the end, which is really just a taste of what the could do with the series.  In Apollo Justice, the sprites are higher resolution, more detailed, and better colored, cut-scenes are now pre-compiled, rather than using sprite manipulation, and everything else you saw in Chapter 5 of Phoenix Wright 1.</p><p>The other huge change for the series is Apollo Justice as the main character.  Apollo Justice, the game, takes place at least 7 years after the end of Phoenix Wright 3, and you begin by defending Phoenix Wright whose been accused of murder.  Through defending him you become aware of your own power as an attorney, much like Phoenix did back in the day.  You overcome people's lies through 'perceiving the truth' by a tell or nervous twitch, rather than 'unlocking it' by seeing their Psyche-Locks.</p><p>Apollo Justice as the main lead is as huge a risk for the series as it is a change and is the largest criticism about the game.  I mean, the previous were named Phoenix Wright (in the US).  He is the game.  Games like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Halo 2 suffered greatly because of this criticism when you played as Raiden or the Arbiter.</p><p>Being a huge fan of Phoenix Wright, I wasn't really bothered by this.  One of my favorite moments in past Phoenix Wright games was playing as a different character and learning about Phoenix Wright from a different angle.  I cared about the Phoenix Wright universe and cast of characters as a whole that seeing it through the eyes of someone was a refreshing change of pace and offered a slew of new jokes and memes.</p><p>After playing for 2 hours, my only complaint about playing as Apollo Justice is that he's almost too much like Phoenix Wright in the beginning.  Though truly, if Phoenix Wright or any other previous character wasn't in this first case, it would have turned me off from the concept.  Phoenix Wright is the crucial immediate tie-in back to the series as a whole and is crucial in shaping Apollo Justice, the character, in becoming the next big thing.</p><p>In Apollo Justice, what I'm most interested in are the tie-ins back to the series as a whole and the future of the series.  When does this take place?  Why should I care about Apollo Justice?  Has this series jumped the shark?  Thankfully that first question was somewhat answered in the first 2 hours of the game.  Something has happened to Phoenix Wright 7 years ago that screwed up his lawyerin' career, and I'm sure that through the course of the game it will be revealed.</p><p>As for jumping the shark, there were several moments in Phoenix Wright 2 and 3 I felt that the series was stale.  The first couple cases felt like more of the same.  Phoenix Wright 2 is the biggest offender.  But, each game ended in a very satisfying way, and Phoenix Wright 3's ending pulled everything together.  It pulled together all the cases in the game, and all the characters and events from previous games.  I would probably not be as excited for Apollo Justice had Phoenix Wright 3 not ended so greatly.</p><p>And here I am now.  Apollo Justice continues with the same enthusiasm and hilariousness the makes the series great.  The first case is a great example of what makes these game fun to play. ^_^  I think this 'restart' of Phoenix Wright will keep fans of the first 3 games happy, as well as, present a good starting point for new people to join the series without playing the previous games (though I haven't played it enough to 100% stand by that assumption).</p><p>I'll let you know as time goes on ^_^.  If you haven't played any Phoenix Wright games, definitely pick up the first one and check it out.</p><p>Also, you can check out a mocked-up demo version of Apollo Justice on Flash here: <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x" title="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x">http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x</a></p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>Now that I'm playing Apollo Justice on the bus, I've stopped playing Brain Age 2 Sudoku for the time being.  I made it pretty far though with 91% completion.  Only 12 or 13 puzzles left to complete.  This is pretty close to make completion of Brain Age 1 Sudoku of 87%.  The Sudoku puzzles in the second game I found to be more challenging and interesting, rather than the first game where the difficult puzzles were just annoying.  The pacing of difficultly as the puzzles went on in Brain Age 2 was very subtle and really pushed you to use different techniques of counting from 1 to 9.  In Brain Age 1, it felt all over the place..</p><p>Though, maybe I've just grown as a Sudoku puzzler.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews/7">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews/5">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
