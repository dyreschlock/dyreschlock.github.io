| August 16, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Final Fantasy XVI is an excellent game with a lot of troubling bits around the outside. It has an expansive story between kingdoms and magic that spans 20 years with an incredibly satisfying end, but I think it fumbles some aspects that the Final Fantasy franchise prides itself upon.</p><div class='title'><b>The World of Valisthea</b></div><p>Final Fantasy XVI is set on the continents of Valisthea, which is divided between six nations in the beginning. Nations engage in war and alliances between each other to either preserve peace or expand their empire. A ravaging blight that spreads across areas of the continents forces these nations into cooperation or conflict.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230802085420_t.webp"/></a></p><p>Each kingdom's capital is built at the seat of a towering mother crystal. From mining the crystal, people are able to channel magic used for filling wells with water, or lighting fires used for cooking, etc. </p><p>There is a subset of humans known as bearers who are able to channel magical powers without the aid of crystals. Within the world, the general population considers bearers sub-human and treats them as slaves. Bearers are sold and used as tools for villages and armies and are often abused and lynched by their masters.</p><p>A very few select bearers are more than simple magic users, they are dominants. Dominants can channel divine beings known as Eikons (or Summons, in previous games). These Eikons are the embodiment of a magical alignment and are massive creatures that can easily destroy armies and cities with a single movement.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151519_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Only a few dominants are known at the beginning of the story, but there are a total of 8. Many of the kingdoms of Valiesthea have at least one among their ranks. Battles between nation's Eikons are rare as they are considered the nuclear option. If one nation began using its dominant to attack another, that nation would have to respond and would result in extensive losses on both sides. Plus, allied nations would have to respond as well. There is always a thin balance of peace and war.</p><p>Many kingdoms view dominants as divine humans and many dominants are part of the royal bloodline of the ruling class, but others view them as demons. A single human should not have control over power great enough to rip the world apart. One nation, The Iron Kingdom, regards them as abominations and puts any child to death that could possibly become a dominant.</p><p class='img'><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17bD_DypbWbz0V9kcCQO7bkQuaqYMHXos/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/ffxvi_cloth_map_t.webp" /><br/>Cloth Map Scan: /ffxvi_cloth_map.png (205.9mb)</a></p></p><p>Overall, this is the world of Final Fantasy XVI at the beginning of the game. The Deluxe Edition of the game came with a cloth map of the world that I scanned and included above. The five mother crystals are pretty easy to see. The castle and capitol of each kingdom lies at the base of the crystal, with the exception of the red crystal to the west. It sits on an island between the Iron Kingdom in the southwest, and Rosaria on the mainland.</p><p>Years ago, there used to be a sixth crystal in the north which had its own kingdom. But the blight engulfed its land destroying the crystal, and completely severing the nation from its resources. All of the brown swaths across the map are areas ravaged by the blight, no longer able to sustain any life.</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>The story of FFXVI focuses on Clive Rosfield, the prince of Rosaria. Clive is the firstborn son of the king, Elwin Rosfield, and has a younger brother, Joshua. Clive attempted the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, but failed, so his mother, Annabella, rejects him for Joshua.</p><p>With the collapse of the northern kingdom, they attempted to invade Rosaria, but failed. To ensure peace with the remains of the north, the Rosfields took the princess, Jill Warrick, as ward. After the complete dissolution of the north, Jill remained in Rosaria and became like a sister to Clive and Joshua. They also have a dog, Torgal.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230722090225_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Story - The Beginning</b></div><p>In the beginning, Clive is a teenager and Joshua and Jill are still children. The Iron Kingdom is moving against Rosaria, so the Duke of Rosaria, Elwin Rosfield, father to Clive and Joshua, moves to attack them. Joshua had successfully completed the ritual to become the Dominant of the Phoenix, so Elwin brings him to the battle as a backup plan. Clive is Joshua's sworn Shield (protector), so he goes, too.</p><p>They travel to Phoenix Gate to prepare their battle plans, but their army is secretly attacked and killed in the night. Annabella betrays them and led the rival nation of Sanbreque to their location. Elwin Rosfield is killed, and Joshua awakens as the Phoenix. Another figure appears as awakens as a second Dominant of Fire, Ifrit. They battle, and the Phoenix is killed. Clive is taken by the Sanbreque army.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723151334_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Good</b></div><p>The World and the Story of Final Fantasy XVI are the best aspects of the game. </p><p>The lore has been well thought out, and the general themes of Final Fantasy have been woven into the fabric of that lore. The conflicts between each country and people make sense and build the relationships between all of the characters in the game. The story takes a lot of inspiration from Game of Thrones, not only in its world building, but its adult story, too. People are killed in often brutal unexpected methods, including main characters.</p><p>The story is a little complicated, but the game has ample resources for you to keep up with the story and understand what's going on. There are two characters in your hideout that help you with this. One character shows the current political map both from the relationships between characters to the actual world map. Another character writes entries in his library about everything you encounter. Also, during action sequences, you can pull up "active lore" that shows all the information that led to the moment you're experiencing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811222950_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>The Story - Continued</b></div><p>13 years pass, and Clive is a slave in the Sanbreque army. He vows revenge against his mother and against the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. During a battle between Dhalmekia and the Iron Kingdom, Clive finds Jill being used by the Iron Kingdom to wage war. He's ordered to kill Jill, but he kills his squad mates and the soldiers holding her captive instead, and they attempt to escape.</p><p>Cid, an outlaw who gives protection to bearers and dominants, finds them and rescues them from the battle. Cid's dream is to create a world where all mankind can be free. No one would keep another as a slave, nor look down on them as being different.  Clive agrees to help Cid find and free more bearers that have been enslaved and used by the kingdoms of Valisthea. </p><p>As they travel, they are attacked by Benedikta, the Dominant of Wind. As they battle, Clive pushes his use of magic passed his limits and transforms into Ifrit to defeat her. Clive realizes that he was the person who became Ifrit and killed his brother. After the battle, he accepts what he has done. </p><p>Clive and Jill join Cid's group of outlaws to bring their idea of the peace to the world. Ultimately, in order to accomplish, Cid says that they must destroy the mother crystals. They infiltrate Sanbreque, and destroy their first mother crystal, but (<I>spoiler</I>) Cid is killed in the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723220330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With Cid gone, Clive takes the mantle of Cid, and for the next 7 years, they continue to free slaves and help everyone they can. Ultimately, they continue Cid's quest to destroy every mother crystal in Valisthea.</p><div class='title'><b>The Bad</b></div><p>Characters and Story are the backbone of every Final Fantasy game. Final Fantasy XVI excels at its expansive, well-thought-out story, but it focuses on a single point, Clive. The whole game revolves around Clive as the central figure responsible for nearly everything that happens in the world. </p><p>In the beginning, it seemed like all the kingdom and characters had agency in how the story and world was shaped.  But, after the second time skip to 20 years after the story began, all the other characters are mostly sitting by, idle, until Clive confronts them on his quest to destroy all the mother crystals.</p><p>The Gameplay is an extension of this as you only ever play as Clive. Perhaps the most controversial change from the Final Fantasy formula was making this more of a single character action game. Final Fantasy used to be the premiere Japanese RPG, where you control a party of characters who excel at magic and weapons. Final Fantasy VII Remake did an excellent job of adding modern action elements while still allowing you control multiple characters and balance your party. In Final Fantasy XVI, you get in a battle and just hack and slash to win. There's a little more than that, but every battle is pretty much the same.</p><p>Because Clive is such a focus in the story and gameplay, other characters get pushed into the background and out of sight. Even if other characters are with you, you almost never really notice. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230726093156_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Jill is an amazing character, and watching Clive and Jill's relationship grow over the course of the game is one of the highlights for me. But, once their relationship hits their peak and they admit and express their love for each other, Jill is pushed off to the side. She hangs back on the ship while you go into the next battle.</p><p>While this happens with most other characters in the game, it especially happens with all the women. Because Clive in the main focus of everything in the game, it pushes the masculine attitude that everything in the man's responsibility and everything must be done by the man, which is somewhat troubling given Final Fantasy's history of strong female characters.</p><p>The game does often recognize this, though, as characters will occasionally tell Clive that saving their world is everyone's responsibility, not just his. But, it is brushed off and forgotten as he continues to kill the next boss.</p><div class='title'><b>The Music</b></div><p>Music is another weak part of Final Fantasy XVI.  Final Fantasy prides itself on all of the music through the franchise, and even makes rhythm games to relive classic moments of your favorite games.</p><p>So much of the music from Final Fantasy XVI is forgettable. There are no strong melodic themes between all of the tracks, and often many of the songs are derivative of previous Final Fantasy music. It all sounds like filler music. There's no identity.</p><p>I almost never pay attention to the background music when playing the game. And now listening to the soundtrack on my computer, I find myself skipping many of the songs to try and find something interesting. No one is going to play these songs in Theatrhythm.</p><div class='title'><b>The Graphics, Art, and Performance</b></div><p>Back to the positives, the game looks absolutely stunning and plays like a dream.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230811100330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The gameplay is pretty repetitive, but there is no point of any input lag between what I'm doing in battle. I'm always able to switch around to the skills that I want to use and evade when an attack is incoming.  Any time I get hit is because of my own screw up. Switching to Performance mode, the game doesn't keep a consistent 60 fps, but it's still quite fluid. Also, loading between scenes takes no more than 2 seconds. It's almost instant between changes map locations or starting a dialogue scene.</p><p>Much of the art direction is excellent, too, with creative and diverse kingdoms with sweeping landscapes. Although, many of the colors are very unsaturated. The world looks very drull and shabby. Many sequences are very dimly lit, too, making everything very dark. This is obviously the image they were going for, and it matches well with the story, but it doesn't make it very scenic. Also, halfway through the game, a spell is cast which darkens the skies and puts a purple hue on everything.</p><div class='title'><b>The End - Ultima</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814095225_t.webp" /></a></p><p><I>Spoilers</I> After destroying the first mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima reveals himself to you. Ultima is an unworldly mysterious figure who attempts to possess you, but is thwarted by Joshua, who is actually alive. As you take over Cid's quest and destroy crystal after crystal, Ultima's intentions reveal themselves.</p><p>Ultima is of a race of beings that existed long before humanity. The beings all had individual bodies, but shared a single consciousness. Together, they were all known as Ultima.</p><p>In the beginning, Ultima create magic, and with magic, life was created as well. Life flourished throughout the world, but a darkness was also born to balance the forces of nature. This darkness grew, consumed life, and Ultima could not stop its advancement. This was the blight.</p><p>The blight was unstoppable and Ultima had no means of saving their world. So, in order to survive, they had to create a new world where their lives could be born and grown again. To create a new world, they first had to find a land that was pure and untouched by the blight. This was impossible in their physical bodies, so they shed their corporeal forms to become a singular spirit. Then, they were able to find the pure lands of ancient Valisthea, rich in the life force known as Aether.</p><p>Being only spirit, Ultima had to plant the seeds of what they would become. They created the mother crystals in order to collect and channel the aether of Valisthea. And secondly, they created humanity. Over time, as humanity matured, they would be able to harness the power of the aether from the crystals. Each crystal bore a different tribe and different magic. One day, there would a single person who would be able to wield all of the magic. And this would be the person that Ultima had waited for. </p><p>Being able to receive all of the aether inside of himself, Ultima could possess this person and cast a spell that would bring them back to physical life in the world and paradise they had created.</p><p>With the world created, Ultima went to sleep and waited for the day when this person would emerge.</p><div class='title'><b>The End - Humanity</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230723115907_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From humanity's perspective, God had abandoned them. And without God to shape their morality and purpose, man had to find their own purpose. Some men desired power and used magic in order to claim it. Powerful men then led their nations in wars against each other in order to keep and expand their power. And with the overuse of magic, the blight had begun to form in Valisthea. Humanity now had its own purpose and will of their own, and God / Ultima was forgotten. </p><p>After Clive's destruction of the mother crystal 13 years ago, Ultima had awaken to see that humanity had spun away from their purpose, his purpose.</p><p>Being able to steal and absorb the magical essence of others, Clive was the person that Ultima was waiting for.</p><p>While Fate had given Clive the ultimate power, it had also given Clive a torturous life of rejection and pain. Ultima needed Clive to give himself completely to Ultima in order for Ultima to become alive again.  But, with every obstacle in Clive's life, every death, every defeat, every failure, Clive continued for himself and the others in his life. </p><p>Humanity was its own being, it was no longer Ultima's to command. Creation of life does not serve as ownership.</p><p>So through the final battle, Clive finally punches God hard enough in the face, and God submits.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814103029_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Clive absorbs the power from Ultima eradicating him and casts a spell that would remove all magic from the world, which ultimately stops the blight. By casting such a powerful spell, it's implied that Clive uses all the aether from within him and is turned to stone.</p><p>Millenia later, humanity lives on with the lives of Clive, Joshua, and the others becoming stories.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Despite its overall problems, this is the most well told Final Fantasy to date. It has an incredible story and very strong characters of Clive and Ultima. Because of the story, it makes sense that everything is funneled into a singular main character, and that everything is very linear.</p><p>Again, it's unfortunate that many other characters get shuffled off to the side. I think the story probably could have been reworked to give those characters more of a spotlight and perhaps made a party of characters. And having a more traditional party could have resulted in more interesting management of equipment and items.</p><p>But, would the game really have been better as a result? The story probably would have suffered, and they wouldn't have been able to completely tell the story that they wanted.</p><p>It's not perfect, but not every Final Fantasy has to be perfect.</p><p>I think the biggest problem with the previous game, Final Fantasy XV, was not having an overall vision from the beginning and trying to balance too many ideas at once. There was a lot of good with Final Fantasy XV, but that game was broken for a long time, and many of the story sequences are still not quite consistent after all the updates.</p><p>Final Fantasy XVI solved all those problems and created a very specific experience that is technologically sound and fantastic. The lows aren't too bad, and the highs are incredible.</p><p>Overall, I think it's excellent.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ffxvi/FINAL_FANTASY_XVI_20230814092229_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lego Horizon - Tallneck" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lego-horizon-tallneck">Lego Horizon - Tallneck</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Many fans of both Lego and Playstation praised the set for how authentic it looked to the game source. Modern Lego designers love to use Lego's vast library of pieces and colors in unique ways to create something that looks less and less like Lego each time.</p><p>Recently I had built the Lego Bonsai tree, and absolutely loved it. I'm not really a fan of Lego's aesthetic and blocky models, and both the Bonsai Tree and the Horizon Tallneck sets, as well as many other modern sets, try to hide these features as much as possible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5886_t.webp"></a></p><p>The Tallneck has so many rounded edges, curved surfaces, and off-angled lines that it looks more like a regular plastic model, rather than a Lego model. Even the joints for each leg have incredible articulation, like an action figure.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5884_t.webp"></a></p><p>Even though the set retails for $100, I was able to get a "used" set from Yahoo Auctions for $40. Used means that the set was already opened and built. They were selling it already built, too. But for that price, I could easily disassemble it and build it up again as if it were the first time.</p><p>The package was pristine when I received it in the mail and it included almost all of the original empty bags that hold the pieces. It was really easy to take apart and organize into its newly opened state.</p><p>Then, on May 13th, I streamed myself building it.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RckDOp3RbAM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>It was fun putting it together, but I didn't really have the same energy that I had with the Bonsai Tree. Maybe it was because I had already seen it completed, so there weren't any surprises.  But, I don't really like the overall look in person. I feel like it still retains some of that block Lego aesthetic even though they try to hide it as much as possible. It's also really big.</p><p>Originally, I was planning on modifying the base to add the Bonsai tree to it, but the Tallneck completely towers over the tree. They don't really compliment each other after all.</p><p>I had it on my shelf for about a month, but I decided to take it down and take it apart again. You can see this progress in the photos below.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5908_t.webp"></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230625_horizon_lego/IMG_5922_t.webp"></a></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The whole process is kind of like taking apart a puzzle after you build it.

If I wanted to make any additions to the set, or use it in some other way, it would always be the center piece. Everything else would have to complement it, rather than creating a balanced scene.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Last of Us Part 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us-part-2">The Last of Us Part 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The first game never felt long or exhausting. Some parts took a while, but I never felt like it was taking forever. The Last of Us 2 shows the full breadth of the journey, from the very beginning to the very end and all parts in the middle. Sometimes it'll skip to where you need to do next, but you take the long way around every time.</p><p>Which, it's hard to fault the game for avoiding shortcuts, telling a complete story, and showing you the full journey. I think The Last of Us 2's biggest strength is its obsessive attention to detail and lack shortcuts in all aspects of the game. It's also its biggest weakness as it makes the game so long. Indulgent or Impressive?</p><p>I guess it's a matter of perspective and expectations, though. I knew what to expect from Last of Us 1 and went through it pretty quickly. I had no idea where this game was going to go.</p><p>It's also insane to me that I was able to buy it for a mere $10 when it feels like the most expensive game ever made. Looking online, apparently it has not come near to breaking even. Which.. given the amount of options people have for entertainment and how people immediately hated the game on its release, makes sense.  I suppose that's why Naughty Dog re-released Last of Us 1 and optioned for the TV Show.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_2/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_20230505100912_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the amount of detail, work, and care that went into The Last of Us 2, I think it's hard not to be impressed.

This takes all of the original hardware of the GameBoy Camera and puts it into a shell that you can attach actual Camera lens. You can read more about here: <a href="/old/v7/gameboy-camera-plus" title="/gameboy-camera-plus">/gameboy-camera-plus</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" /></p><p>Attached to the Pocket Camera Plus, I'm using a pretty generic and bare bones Zoom lens. I just bought whatever was cheapest on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">Amazon</a>. It has manually focus, zoom, and aperture, and has a focus length of 6mm up to 60mm. I guess that means it has a 10x zoom. Each of the rings has a pin used for movement, but these pins can be screwed in to keep the current setting.</p><p>In addition to the manual settings of the lens, the GameBoy Camera game has a Contrast and Brightness setting. Contrast is very important to reduce the harsh lights and darks coming into the camera. There is some automatic brightness control that the camera already does. This makes the manual aperture nearly useless. And even the digital brightness settings in the game can get overridden by the software trying to autocorrect the brightness.</p><p>For the following photos, I really only used the manual Zoom and Focus, and digital Contrast when taking photos.</p><p>Anyway, with my Pocket Camera and regular Camera, I went around town throughout the weekend and tested it out.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakurano Park <span class='ja'>桜野公園</span></b></div><p>It's Spring in Takayama, so the Cherry Blossoms are in full boom. One of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Takayama is northwest of the main town. On the way to Kokufu, Sakurano Park is off to the side of the highway on the other side of the river. It's the perfect place to have a picnic on a warm Spring afternoon while viewing the cherry blossoms. (Although, this Spring has been freezing with the occasional snow)</p><p>I took some photos in late evening as the sun was setting.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div

incredible amount of flexibility when taking photos. No matter how close or how far away from the subject, the zoom allows you to frame the photo and the focus allows you to get all of the detail. The sensor itself is still primitive by only allowing 4 colors, but you can still get a ton of clarity.</p><p>Of course, photos are best taken when the subject is clearly light. If there is no strong light source, then it can be hard to squeeze out detail. 4 colors can only do so much.</p><div class='title'><b>Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span></b></div><p>The next day, I went to Shiroyama Park downtown and took a few more photos.

| April 7, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Back in February, people began circulating a video about a mod for the GameBoy Camera. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnSb0cRK9xI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnSb0cRK9xI">Macho Nacho made a video</a> about how you could take apart your GameBoy camera, and put it into a new shell created by 2BitToy. This shell used a CS mount ring, which would allow you to attach any CS mount camera lens to the GameBoy camera. People have made GameBoy Camera mods before. But, this was the first non-destructive, compact, and stable modification made easily available.</p><p>Here's the website detailing the mod: <a href="https://2bittoy.carrd.co/" title="https://2bittoy.carrd.co/">https://2bittoy.carrd.co/</a></p><p>It looked really simple and it wasn't too expensive. The Analogue Pocket has recently revived my interest in retro handheld accessories, so I ordered all of the parts and let things slowly arrive over time. Now that it's Spring Break, it's time to put everything together!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was really surprised how fast and easy it came together. You can look through the pictures below to see how I assembled everything together. Macho Nacho's video also shows the step-by-step process of putting together the camera.</p><p><b>One thing to note!</b> In Macho Nacho's video, he doesn't recommend using this mod with the Analogue Pocket. However, he's using Version 1 of the 3D printed shell. When I purchased the parts, Shapeways had Version 2. Version 2 is a little fatter than the original.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the whole thing assembled, it is really tight when fitting it into the cartridge slot of the Analogue Pocket. This may or may not be a problem in itself, BUT there is no movement of the cartridge after it's inserted. It is very solid. That said, when actually taking pictures, I'm not going to hold it like a GameBoy. I plan on holding it in the middle to balance all of the weight.</p><div class='title'><b>Assembly</b></div><p>There are 3 overall steps required to make this once you've gathered all of the parts: (1) taking apart a GameBoy Camera, (2) glueing the CS mount ring and IR filter, and (3) putting everything together. I let the Epoxy sit overnight to harden, but otherwise, it took me no longer than an hour to do everything. It was really fast.</p><p>I would recommend glueing the CS mount ring and IR filter first. Then, the disassembly and assembly can be done together very quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>Required Parts and Tools for Building</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Macho Nacho's video details all of the parts and tools you'll need, but I'll reiterate them here for comparison.</p><p>There are 5 main set of parts you'll need to create the Camera Plus.</p><p>1. You'll need an original <b>GameBoy Camera</b>. You'll take this apart and use the insides. If you don't already have one, you'll have to search on eBay for one. I got one from Yahoo Auctions for 2930<span class='ja'>円</span> with shipping.</p><p>2. You'll need a set of <b>3D printed plastic components</b> to create the new shell for the Camera. You can print them yourself using the files from 2BitToy's website. Or, you can buy printed ones from ShapeWays. There are 4 total: The front and back shell, the sensor mount, and the IR filter mount. With shipping to Japan, this was $92.83<br/><a href="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy" title="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy">https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy</a></p><p>3. This is optional, but it's probably worth it. You'll need a <b>10mm x 1.0mm IR Filter</b>. Linked below is the one that I purchased. It was 1200<span class='ja'>円</span>.<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V</a></p><p>4. You'll need a <b>5mm CS Mount Lens ring</b>. This will be glued to the back shell and used to screw in the lens. It was 816<span class='ja'>円</span><br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A</a></p><p>5. Lastly, you'll need a <b>CS Mount Zoom Lens</b>. This is the one I purchased. Only 2660<span class='ja'>円</span>!<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9</a></p><p>Altogether, the materials cost 7606<span class='ja'>円</span> and $92.83, a total of about $150. Actually, I suppose this isn't so cheap after all. Although, your mileage may vary depending on how cheap you can get a GameBoy Camera and Lens.</p><div class='title'><b>Required Tools</b></div><p>You'll also need a few totals to disassemble the GameBoy Camera and glue some parts together. This adds a little bit more to the grand total.</p><p>1. You probably already have a <b>Phillips screwdriver</b>, but you need to have one fine enough to remove small screws. </p><p>2. You'll also need <b>Epoxy</b> to glue the Lens ring to the back shell and the IR filter to its mount. You may already have this, but it's easy to buy at your local hardware store. You can see the brand I purchased from my photos.</p><p>3. Something you probably don't have is a <b>Tri-point screwdriver</b>. Old Nintendo products used screws with three divots in them, rather than a flat-head or a Phillips. I did not already have this. They are readily available on Amazon, though. I bought the following one.<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS</a></p><div class='title'><b>Photo Results</b></div><p>It is uncanny how much definition and versatility this modification adds to the GameBoy. You can take a picture from across the room by zooming in and focusing using the dials on the lens.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I can't wait to take this thing out in the field and take some photos.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Last of Us" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

People had survived, but many didn't. In present day, a governmental military organization runs strict quarantine procedures in many urban areas. Though, many had fallen to uprisings or further outbreaks.</p><p>You play as Joel. As the outbreak occurred 20 years ago, he lost his daughter. But he continued to survive, doing anything that was necessary. In present day, he is tasked with bringing a young girl, Ellie, across the country in hopes of finding a cure for the infection. Throughout the journey, they experience loss and they gain trust and companionship with each other. Over time, Joel allows himself to love and be responsible for someone else again. Ellie as well, allow herself to trust someone unequivocally after being abandoned by everyone she's known in her life.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103758_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Originally released for the Playstation 3 in the fall of 2013, many people regard it to be one of the best stories of all time portrayed in a video game. After playing it for the first time, I thought it was okay. Zombies have been done to death, and this didn't really seem all that original. ESPECIALLY, when Telltale's Walking Dead game come out a year prior and roughly told the exact same story. I guess people liked Last of Us better because there was actual gameplay behind it, rather than only dialogue.</p><p>This year, 9 years after the release of the first game, HBO and Naughty Dog created The Last of Us TV show. The first season (of 9 episodes) covers the entirety of the first game. It is incredible how well the tension is portrayed in the show. Everything feels like it has weight. Pedro Pascal truly brings out how much Joel does not want to relive his daughter's death through having to take responsibility for Ellie. And Bella Ramsey perfectly portrays Ellie's care-free attitude that hides her true inner feelings. Their slow personality changes over their terrifying and horrific experiences feel authentic and help you identify with both of their situations and choices.</p><p>At the end of the TV show, I felt like I understood the characters better than I had before. Also, it had been long enough since The Walking Dead and the overexposure of Zombie media, that I was more open to paying attention to the finer details of the story, rather than quickly writing it off.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/vlcsnap-2023-03-26-15h53m59s783_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Because of the TV show, I decided to replay The Last of Us again. There are 3 separate versions of The Last of Us, plus a standalone story, plus a sequel. Almost a year after the Playstation 3 release, the game was touched up and remastered for the Playstation 4 in 2014. The standalone story was included in this. With the overwhelming success of the game, The Last of Us Part 2 was released in 2020. And, they've remastered the original game again for the Playstation 5. The Last of Us Part 1 was released in September 2022. I played <b>Last of Us Remastered</b> on Playstation 4 because I already owned it, and the Playstation 5 version was expensive.</p><p>Today, I finished it. It was very interesting comparing it to the TV show. There were plenty of parts that they changed to adapt the video game to television, but I was really surprised how much of it was identical. Same basic overall story beats, but with a bit more context added and a lot of action and fight scenes removed. I'm curious how much things changed in the Playstation 5 remaster.</p><p>Anyway, as I originally played the Playstation 3 version 9 years ago, I was very impressed with the environments. So much vegetation had reclaimed the concrete building over the 20 years since civilization had fallen. The Playstation 3 never had an option for screenshots, so I could never roam around taking photos in the game. Thankfully, screenshots became a standard addition with video games for the Playstation 4.  As I replayed Last of Us Remastered, I was to take all of the screenshots that I couldn't before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230322101601_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326103229_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/last_of_us_1/The_Last_of_Us_Remastered_20230326132207_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think in some areas, the age does show in the game. If you look close enough, you can see the seams in the graphics. But, even though the game is 8 or 9 years old, the overall composition of level design and art direction is undeniable gorgeous. It still looks quite incredible today.  All of my screenshots are included below, so take a look. :)</p><p>With Last of Us complete, I plan on planning Last of Us Part 2 next, mainly to get ahead of any spoilers for the next season of the TV show. Although, there is an absolute major spoiler that I already know about as it was unavoidable to know unless you played the game immediately upon release. Thankfully, that's all I know about it.</p><p>Anyway, I hope Last of Us 2 is just as beautiful as the first game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to New Pokemon Snap" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/new-pokemon-snap">New Pokemon Snap</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 16, 2021 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>One of the most beloved and revered spinoffs of Pokemon is Pokemon Snap for Nintendo 64. The idea of roaming around in a land while wild Pokemon "naturally" interact with each other and the environment has always given reality to people's imagination of how the real world of Pokemon could be.</p><p>For years, people have always said that they should make a modern update to Pokemon Snap and they finally did. Release on April 30th, <b>New</b> Pokemon Snap is the modern update every one had been asking for.</p><p>Back on the Nintendo 64, only 151 Pokemon were available, but 20 years later, there are now over 900 Pokemon. This game doesn't have all 900, but it has an incredibly balanced variety of Pokemon from all the different generations. It's pretty amazing how much New Pokemon Snap doesn't focus on just one generation.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>New Pokemon Snap plays almost identically to the original. You character hops into a pod and is pulled through the world on a mostly linear track. Your job is to take photos of Pokemon that appear in the environment. </p><p>Through the game, you unlock some ways to interact with the Pokemon. In New Pokemon Snap, you can throw out food for them to eat, throw orbs to light up pokemon, and play music. These interactions can change the course of your pod, or unlock other things.</p><p>Expanded from the original is the possibility of different tiered photographs. Depending on the interactions you before with Pokemon, they could perform a unique pose or even a special pose.  Every Pokemon now has 4 level of photographs to be taken. Tier 1 is a stand photo and Tier 2 is typically the Pokemon eating food. Tier 3 and Tier 4 are reserved for unique poses</p><p>With 200 total Pokemon in the game and each Pokemon having 2 unique poses, that's 400 unique photographs you need to take. It is a bit overwhelming, especially towards the end of the game when you're missing many of these photos. When you only get 1 or 2 new photos in a single run, it gets VERY repetitive and VERY boring quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>High Score</b></div><p>All photos in the game give you a score. If you get a "perfect" photo, it'll be worth 4000 or more points. All of these points add up to the total score of your Photodex. Pokemon Snap came out right at the beginning of Golden Week, so I had an entire week off from work to devote to this game. I was playing this game almost every day for HOURS after its release, so I was flying through the game.</p><p>Additionally, you can connect online and compare your Photodex score to everyone in the world. At my peak, I was able to become nearly 800th place in the world.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021050501002500_s.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, I could not keep up this pace forever. Vacation had finished, and I had to get back to work. Everyone else in the world who played video game for a living continue on without me.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnout</b></div><p>As mentioned above, once you do the broad strokes of everything in the game, all that is left is grinding. Finding all of the remaining photos, one by one. Slowly increasing the scores of your photos, one by one. Doing the same tracks, again and again and again. </p><p>There's not really much skill involved with the game. You wait 5 minutes to get the perfect photo, and if you miss it by a fraction of a second, you gotta do it again.  You try to get Pokemon to do what you want, but it occasionally goes wrong, and gets frustrating.</p><p>Eh, there's really no reason to push myself too hard in this game just to build my hatred for it. It's a good game and I like it, otherwise.</p><p>So, I put the game down. Here are my final stats in the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/210516_pokemonsnap/2021051619081800_s.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it's a fun game with a lot of stuff to do. The Pokemon interactions are fun and interesting. Plenty of Easter eggs and hidden interactions to find that are really satisfying when you naturally find them.  Definitely worthy of the Pokemon Snap name. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Chrono Cross Anniversary Tour" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/chrono-cross-tour">Chrono Cross Anniversary Tour</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 17, 2019 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My absolute favorite video game soundtrack of all time is from Chrono Cross. It was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and had the perfect blend of atmosphere, mystery, and comfort. It perfectly complemented the dreamy and whimsical world of Chrono Cross.</p><p>This year is the 20th Anniversary of Chrono Cross, and to celebrate Mitsuda has gotten his band together to give a live tour of the Chrono Cross soundtrack. It will be performed 5 times in 3 cities, including Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya.  Tickets were not so cheap at 16800<span class='ja'>円</span> (equivalent to $168), but it would be an absolute dream to hear my favorite video game music performed by the actual creator of the music. Easy buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Morning of the Concert</b></div><p>Prior to the concert, I met up with someone from the Internet who was also attending. We had our tickets reserved, but had to go to the venue early to actually get our tickets. Additionally, I wanted to visit the venue early because the merchandise booth was going to be open, too.</p><p>We went to the venue around Noon and waited for it to open. Plenty of other people were there, too. At 1:30pm, doors open but only a few people were allowed entry at a time. We eventually made it in at 2pm.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9219_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9225_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>At the entrance, we gave our reservations to the clerk, and they gave us our tickets. Inside were only a few people, and it was a line for the merch booth that curved around the room. </p><p>My goal was to purchase the concert towel for the event. In Japan, almost every concert or tour has a towel associated with it. It's kind of like a band's tour T-shirt in America. Tell 'em where you've been by buying a towel. The towel was 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> and I bought some stickers, too, for 1000<span class='ja'>円</span>. The tickets included a pamphlet of the concert, so I didn't buy that. Minutes after I purchased the towel, they were sold out, so I was able to get one in the nick of time. :)</p><p>We went back to my car to dump off our stuff, got some lunch, and went right back to the venue for the evening concert.</p><div class='title'><b>The Concert</b></div><p>We probably got back to the venue at 3pm or 3:30pm, and waited in line again. When the doors opened at 4pm, they were letting people in by sequential order of their tickets. Each individual ticket number was checked and let in by the order of when their tickets were purchased. You'd think this would take forever, but it went pretty quickly.  We made it in around 4:30pm, and the show began around 5:15pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9226_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The venue was tiny. Capacity was probably 1000 people? (as long as they were all smashed together) WAYYY smaller than the Tokyo or Osaka venues. It was nice, though. Much more intimate.</p><p>The band members took the stage in darkness, tuned their instruments, and the opening sequence for the concert began to play on the screen behind them. The dreamy motions of the title of screen of Chrono Cross. It detailed the preamble of the story.  And then, the heavy reverberations of the guitar being plucked as <b>Scars of Time</b> began, which moved into the light Flute.</p><p>It was incredible. It completely opened up my mind to hearing this music for the first time around 20 years ago when that first trailer dropped on the Internet, and when I imported the game on Playstation.</p><p>Mitsuda quickly introduced himself and the band as they played the opening menu music to the game. As "New Game" was selected, they played the battle music, which is how the game starts.</p><p>Overall, they played through the entirety of the game on the screen, and played the entirety of the soundtrack to accompany it.  I wrote down a rough setlist of what they played:</p><p><u>Main Set</u><br/>	1.	Chrono Cross - Scars of Time<br/>	2.	The Dream that Time Dreams<br/>	3.	Garden of God (Title Screen)<br/>	4.	Between Life and Death (Battle Music)<br/>	5.	Arni Village - Home World<br/>	6.	Arni Village - Another World<br/>	7.	Fields of Time - Home World<br/>	8.	Lizard Dance<br/>	9.	Termina - Another World<br/>	10.	Forest of Illusion<br/>	11.	Viper Mansion<br/>	12.	Gale (Boss Music)<br/>	13.	Victory (A Gift of Spring)<br/>	14.	Guldove - Another World<br/>	15.	Fortress of Ancient Dragons<br/>	16.	A Narrow Space Between Dimensions<br/>	17.	Dead Sea / Tower of Destruction<br/>	18.	Prisoners of Fate<br/>	19.	Magical Dreamers<br/>	20.	Zelbess<br/>	21.	Fate - The God of Destiny<br/>	22. Burning Orphanage??<br/>	23.	The Girl who Stole the Stars<br/>	24.	Frozen Flame<br/>	25.	Dragon God?? (Explanation for Elements. Screwing up, then Game Over)<br/>	26.	A Light for Lost Hopes (Game Over music)<br/>	27.	Life - Distance Promise (Elemental Song)<br/>	28.	Radical Dreamers - Unstolen Jewel<br/>	29.	Fragment of a Dream</p><p><u>Encore</u><br/>	1.	Song to get Mitsuda back on Stage<br/>	2.	Band Members Introduction Song<br/>	3.	Voyage - Another World??<br/>	4.	Voyage - Home World??<br/>	5.	Marbule - Another World</p><p>It wasn't like they just "played" the soundtrack to Chrono Cross. All of these were live variations of the original score. They deviated and mostly improved upon what they had before, and were able to match the crowd's reactions as they played. Much of the concert felt very interactive and Mitsuda explained a lot of his feelings and ideas for each song through the concert.</p><p>As the concert finished, there were credits on the screen, too. I have never been to a concert before with a credits screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Stuff</b></div><p>Concluding the show, this was all the stuff I came away with. I grabbed some of the heart confetti that were shot in the air during the concert, my light stick, and the things that I purchased earlier. Also included is a book of artwork we received as part of our ticket purchase. We also got a flame pendant, too, but that's not pictured here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_9227_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Again, it was absolutely incredible and a dream come true to see, hear, and feel the music that has shaped my music tastes in video games. It was super dorky to rock out to RPG battle music. It was moving hearing Scars of Time and the other intro song live. And it was fun getting the audience to work together with their colored glowsticks to get the elements in the right order to get the true ending of the game/concert.</p><p>Mitsuda created an amazing concert, and with all of the production that went into the lights and video on display, I understand where the $168 price tag came from.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>With the conclusion of 2 additional final dates in Tokyo, Mitsuda has released an official set list from the concert.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/SvsloeA.webp" /></a></p><p>They also made an Apple playlist as well, so you can hear the music from the soundtrack.</p><p><a href="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44" title="https://music.apple.com/jp/playlist/chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44">https://music.apple.com/.../chrono-cross-20th-anniversary-live-tour-2019-radical/pl.u-vVvDTdWe44</a></p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 12th, 2020</I></b></div><p>In a tweet, Mitsuda mentions that the final Nakano performance was recorded, and he is in the process of mastering the audio.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - February 27th, 2020</I></b></div><p>As part of our ticket purchase, we were to receive a concert booklet of the event. We received an art book, but it was pretty short and didn't include anything about the concert itself. We filled out a card in order to receive this booklet later.</p><p>I got mine in the mail today.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0122_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Calling this thing a booklet doesn't do it justice. In fact, this thing is thicker than most pre-order bonus art books. There are tons of photos from each of the events, interviews, sheet music, and logo designs. Almost all the production that went into planning the concert is included in the book.</p><p>This was BY FAR the most production value I've ever seen packed into a single musical event. In the beginning, it seemed like the concert was a huge expense, but it's clear how much love and care went into the event. Mitsuda clearly loves his music for Chrono Cross as much as his fans, and he loved this experience as much as we did.</p><p>It's an incredible memorial of the event.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - June 24th, 2020</I></b></div><p>This is the concert that keeps on giving. Today, Mitsuda and Procyon Studios released their recording of the final concert in Nakano Plaza. For only 1800<span class='ja'>円</span> on <a href="https://mora.jp/package/43000033/A86298/?fmid=TOPNEWRL01" title="https://mora.jp/package/43000033/A86298/?fmid=TOPNEWRL01">Mora</a>, you could download the complete concert in FLAC format. </p><p>I have been listening to this nonstop on repeat at work while I check student's writing. It's absolutely incredible to be able to relive this concert again and again.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - January 25th, 2021</I></b></div><p>Everyone said it was going to happen, and today Procyon and Mitsuda announced a live Bluray release of the final concert performance at Nakano plaza. </p><p>I purchased the limited edition version of the Bluray which comes with a download for an arrangement album of Chrono tunes, and some extra stuff.  This cost a total of 14100<span class='ja'>円</span>, which is a lot for a Bluray, but this'll be the very last Mitsuda can ring out of me from the concert. 14100 for the bluray, 16800 for tickets, and 2800 for merch. This totals 33700<span class='ja'>円</span>, or about $337.</p><p>It was totally worth it, though.</p><div class='title'><b><I>Update - April 15th, 2021</I></b></div><p>The preorder for the Bluray concluded on March 1st, and 6 weeks later, I was finally able to catch my deliveryman and get my Bluray.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/191117_chrono/IMG_0523_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It includes a full Dolby 5.1 surround sound experience of the concert with absolutely crisp audio and a full video recording of the event, too.</p><p>Also included is a short pamphlet of photos from the event, and a download code for the arrangement album. This arrangement is okay. I don't think it's as mind-blowing as the actual concert, but it's still a great listen. Much more low-key, too.</p><p>…And now, finally the saga is concluded. An absolutely amazing concert with many ways to relive and cherish those memories.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Favorite Games Mosiac (Top 18)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/favorite-games-mosaic">Favorite Games Mosiac (Top 18)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

You play as Gillian Seed who had lost his memory and joined the Junkers, a police division which specializes in hunting down the Snatchers. Ultimately, the plot is uncovered and Gillian Seed gets more answers to his past. </p><p>Snatcher was Hideo Kojima’s second game as a sole director. The Sega CD version was the one I played back in the day. It was released in 1994 and was the 4th iteration having prior been released on PC-8801 (1988), MSX (1988), and Turbo CD (1992). This was the only American release, and it was complete with English voice acting and cutscenes. </p><p>The music is very futuristic 90s synthwave that matches the grimey, dirty, and metallic feeling of Neo Kobe City. As the story builds, the music builds with it. It was one of the first games I played where the music set a tense mood and atmosphere rather than just being background music. Snatcher’s sound and music was written and arranged by Akira Yamaoka. This was one of his first games, too. Later on, he would curate and write music for DDR, and ultimately move on to create the Silent Hill series.</p><p>I will always love Snatcher, and I don’t think I’ll ever knock it off my No. 1 position as my favorite game of all time.</p><div class='title'><b>My Favorite Games</b></div><p>As you can see from my list, my favorite games tend to be the ones that allow exploration of a massive world, have a compelling story with unique and distinct characters, and have a unique and memorable soundtrack that accurately compliments the setting, the gameplay, or the story. I tend to value those aspects over the actual gameplay.</p><p>It’s interesting to see how my favorites list has changed over the last few decades. You can view my list from 2007 below. Over time, I can’t really see this list changing much more. I think the top entries are pretty much set.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Horizon Zero Dawn" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 5, 2017 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Horizon Zero Dawn was a game for the Playstation 4 released in March of 2017.  It’s an absolutely beautiful game set in the far future after current society had already collapsed.  Roaming the lands are robotic animals that human civilizations hunt and harvest for parts to build and protect their villages.</p><p>From the moment it was first shown at E3 in 2015, everyone wanted to know more about it.  The concept looked interesting and unique.  Unfortunately, it’s release in early 2017 was completely blown away by The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.  On the surface, both games were an open world that lent itself towards exploration.  But Zelda had many aspects that innovated and expanded the genre compared to Horizon’s iterative approach.</p><p>But, unlike Zelda’s pure sense of exploration, Horizon’s strong sense of story fueled my exploration of the game’s world.  How did the world turn out like this?  Why are their robotic animals running around?  What is going on?  Underneath the lush beauty of nature are several metallic facilities of a futuristic society long dead.  Why?  And by the end, there are satisfactory answers to these questions.</p><p>Combat feels great.  Every beast you encounter has a weakness to exploit, or some specialized parts to harvest.  After a while, you are given enough equipment to take on these enemies in a variety of ways.  You can set traps, or blow off body parts.  Fire down arrows from safety, stealthily melee enemies from bushes, or just run in and attack directly.  It’s fun, and certainly challenging on higher difficulties.</p><p>Throughout my play through of the game, I stopped several times to use the photo mode and take a picture of the environment around me.  So many shots and scenes in this game is incredibly gorgeous, and the photo mode made everything come out great.  Every game should have a photo mode at this point.  Below are all the shots that I kept.  They include areas and scenes from the DLC, as well.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
