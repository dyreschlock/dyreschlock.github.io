| January 7, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Talking this game is somewhat of a moot point.  Everyone knows about its existence and how it was the most anticipated game of 2009 and the highest grossing game as well.  And most people know of the controversial Airport scene.</p><p>I knew these things, but didn't really care.  I wasn't a fan of the original, and never really saw the appeal either.  I can't really find the words to describe why I disliked it.  I played it for about 20 minutes before I set the controller down and said, "this game is not for me."  I seemed unpolished, generic, and dull.  But whatever, lots of people seem to like it.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple weekends ago at Dave's place that I actually had a chance to play Modern Warfare 2, so I figured why not.  The videos that were shown at E3 made the game look beautiful.  And after the first couple of minutes, Modern Warfare 2 definitely prides itself on presentation.  It is one of the most beautiful looking games out there.</p><p>The beginning eased me into how to shoot things, and how to fight effectively in combat using more than just my main weapon.  Switching to a handgun is faster than reloading.  Using your knife is an instant kill when you're next to an enemy.  Also, your weapon will always snap to a nearby target when aiming.  It's easy to play, and lends itself well to different strategies when fighting many enemies.  There's always another way to accomplish your task.</p><p>Essentially, Modern Warfare 2 charmed me with its graphics, and the fluid varied controls kept me playing and challenged.  Last week, I received it from Gamefly and began my assault.</p><p><b>Airport Scene</b> (spoilers)</p><p>For those that don't know about the "airport scene"...  In the 4th chapter entitled "No Russian", you play as Private Allen.  He's the recruit you played in the beginning while getting used to the controls, and then put into a battle field fighting a militia.  At the end of the mission, General Shepard says he has a special mission for you.  You are to stick close to Makarov as a deep cover agent.  And this has brought you to a Russian airport.</p><p>The mission begins in a closet with Makarov and some other guys.  You are dressed in suits, bullet proof vests, and armed with chain guns.  Before Makarov opens the door he says, "Remember..  No Russian."  You walk out of the closet in a crowded airport security checkpoint.  Your group aims their weapons, and fire on the crowd.  You continue through the airport terminal mascaraing any individuals you find.  Some security guards fight back, but you can't get hurt.  Your group murders everyone.</p><p>Throughout this opening scene, you can choose to kill the innocent or do nothing.  If you shoot any of your group, the game quits and pulls you back to your last checkpoint.  If you stand back the doorway and not move anywhere, your group will wait.  The game forces you through this entire scene, and you can't prevent anything from happening, unless you want to quit the game completely.</p><p>After going through the terminal, walking over all the innocent slain, the Russian forces arrive and you fight them and make your way to the get-a-way car.  Everyone hops in in front of you.  Someone comments, "This will definitely send a message."  As the last person in, Makarov stops you, and pierces your chest with a bullet.  Makarov replies, "No, this is the message."  And your dead American body responsible for this terrorist attack on Russia creates war between America and Russia.</p><p><b>The Ending</b> (spoilers)</p><p>Throughout Modern Warfare 2 you go back and forth between "Ramirez" fighting Russian troops on American soil, and "Roach" part of Task Force 141 who know that Makarov is behind the terrorist attack and follow his trail throughout the world to uncover his plot.  Eventually, you find out that General Shepard is the one behind the attacks, and everything comes to climax assaulting his hidden base head-on and eventually facing him.</p><p>The final battle is between you, playing "Soap" MacTavish and Captain Price versus General Shepard.  The battle begins with Shepard hopping on a boat and taking off.  Naturally, you and Price grab the second boat and take off after him.  There's lot of rockets, helicopters, and other boats to fight and dodge as you close in Shepard's boat.</p><p>Eventually Shepard gets far enough ahead of you that he boards a helicopter.  Price orders you to steady to boat as he takes a few shots and takes down the helicopter.  Unfortunately, you've gone to far down the rapids and go over a waterfall.</p><p>When you wake, you pull yourself up, take out your knife, and stagger towards the smoldering crashed helicopter.  You find an enemy soldier trying to get away.  You slice him.  You find another one next to the crash, reading his gun.  He pulls the trigger, but it's empty.  You slice him.  A few feet forward, Shepard pops out of the wreck and staggers forward.  You continue after him.  He stops at a wrecked car to catch his breath.  You go in for the kill...  But he catches you, smacks you head on the side of the car, knocks you to the ground, and stabs you in the chest.  The world goes dark.</p><p><b>The Message</b> (spoilers)</p><p>You wake a couple seconds later to Shepard's voice...  "5 years ago, I watched as 30,000 of my men were slaughtered.  All of them died for their country as America sat back and watched.  Tomorrow, thousands will line up to volunteer in this war.  It doesn't matter who started it."  "The Victors write history," he says as he points his revolver in your face.</p><p>It doesn't end there.  Price jumps Shepard as he pulls the trigger, and saves your life.  As Price and Shepard out of your vision, you see the revolver and struggle over to it hitting RT and LT to move.  Shepard gets the upper hand, kicks the gun away, and knocks you out.  You fade in and out of consciousness as they fight.  Shepard gets the upper hand again, but you notice the knife in your chest.</p><p>Here's where Modern Warfare 2 takes a fantastic gameplay cue from <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b>.  To pull the knife out of your chest, you must bang away at the X button.  You need to HURRY though!  Price is getting his ass kicked.  It takes a lot out of you (the player) to bang away at the button to make the game continue.  It attempts to convey the physicality of what your character is going through.  Through this scene I'm thinking to myself, "C'mon!! You can make it, C'mon! C'mon!"</p><p>After railing that X button for about 20 seconds the knife is out and you chuck it into Shepard's eyeball.  Success!</p><div class='title'><b>Digesting the Message</b></div><p>So, the whole reason this [fictional] war was started was to get America off its fat, lazy, ignorant ass and do something for their country.  There's definitely something to that.</p><p>I think this message gives the Airport Scene relevance by putting you in the shoes of a murderer.  Yeah, there are people out there that do this.  And yeah, this is what happens when you sit by and do nothing.  There are consequences to your inactions.</p><p>One of the quotes presented throughout the game really emphasizes this point:</p><p><em>"A citizen of America will cross the ocean to fight for democracy but won't cross the street to vote in a national election"</em> - Bill Vaughn</p><p>Hopefully the tens of millions of gamers playing Modern Warfare 2 take something from this message and, at the very least, not make the problems in America worse.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Also, I just beat Modern Warfare 2's campaign on Veteran.  Is this mode supposed to be hard?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dragon Age &amp; Game Longevity" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dragon-age-game-longevity">Dragon Age &amp; Game Longevity</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| December 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Back in High School and College, I used to measure a game's worth based on the amount of time spent playing it.  If it took me at least 60 hours for me to reach the end, then I fully felt like I got my money's worth.  I felt cheated if I bought a game only to beat it a mere 10 hours later.  With games running up a bill of $50 or $60, it was too much to spend on something that would only keep my attention for no more than a week.</p><p>But, things change...</p><div class='title'><b>Games have changed</b></div><p>Back in the day, the only games that made me feel something were those that had enough time to build character.  RPGs and Adventure games took me on a long journey.  I met new characters, and helped them sort out their lives.  Which in turn, let my own character learn more about themselves.  Given the amount of time spent with the characters, I grew attached to them and the story started to mean something to me.  I cared about what happens for more than just curiosity sake.  I want my characters to succeed, fall in love, and overcome their heart ships.</p><p>Other games, like 1st person shooters and action games, didn't have the capacity for passion.  It was more about the fun you had playing the game.  Which is perfectly fine, of course.  But for me, most games feel incredibly empty if they aren't engaging me on an emotional level.</p><p>I don't find that's the case anymore.  The game industry has matured to the point where a game nearly fails if it doesn't connect to the player on an emotional level.  It's boring if the characters an empty shells and have no humanity.  Having an interesting story with engaged characters is as pivotal to success as making sure the game works to begin with.</p><p>Games like <b>Uncharted 2</b>, <b>Batman Arkham Asylum</b>, <b>Brutal Legend</b>, <b>Shadow of the Colossus</b>, <b>Fatal Frame</b>, <b>Bioshock</b>, <b>Dead Space</b> are all ones that will take someone no longer than 10 or 15 hours to complete.  You can easily complete the game throughout the course of a weekend.  And within that time is an incredibly rich experience.  Just as rich as any Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy.</p><p>In fact, I find these games much more engaging <em>because</em> they won't take up longer than a weekend.</p><div class='title'><b>I have changed</b></div><p>I graduated college 3 years ago, and have worked almost every day since.  My weekday is spent thoughtfully thinking about elegant solutions to complex and interesting problems.  It's spent building applications and maintaining them.  I don't have time to think about some game that I'm in the middle of playing.  It really ends up being a distraction.</p><p>In my spare time, I do more than just game.  I sell things on eBay.  I hang out with friends.  I try and fail to meet girls.  I listen to music.  I go to clubs.  I go to other events on the weekends and sometimes during the week.  I meet people for dinner.  I read, though not often.  I shop for games, and sometimes other things.  And plenty of other crap.  And usually afterward, I write about the more interesting things.  Plus, there are other games to play.</p><p>Finishing a game within a weekend gives me the perfect opportunity to completely devote myself to it.  I usually won't have any distractions at all, unless I meet up with some friends at a bar on Saturday night.  Once I wake up on Sunday, I can sit in front of the TV all day and think about nothing else.</p><p>Without any real distractions, I get more out of the game.  I experience it all from start to finish.  And then I usually reflect by writing something about it.  (Unless the game really didn't mean anything, afterall).  A free weekend is perfectly suited for a game, but if it starts spilling into the week it starts eating into time I can, should, or want to do something else.</p><div class='title'><b>Dragon Age</b></div><p>Dragon Age has been the first game I've played in a while that exceeds 20 hours, and it's really annoying.  I've only been able to play the game in 10 hour chunks here and there, and it's almost been a month since I started.  Many of my friends have actually finished the game well before me.  It really feels like it's been dragging on and on.  Though, the game does splinter off in different directions that aren't very well connected, so it's hard to hold on to all the story at once.</p><p>In the beginning, I was gun-ho! about playing the game through a second time, but there's no way I'd find the time.  I might take a look at some of the other Origin stories, but I think they'll feel empty to me.</p><p>Dragon Age is all about the character I made and have spent these 45 hours with.  She may not say a word of dialog throughout the game, but she has actually changed.  Or rather, I have changed the character I portray.</p><div class='title'><b>My Story</b></div><p><em>(I went the path of the Female Human Nobel or Warrior Princess named Rikki.)</em></p><p>After my kingdom had been destroyed and my family slain by Howe, I was a mean, sad little girl.  I was rude to others, and even killed those who were unfortunate because I didn't care.  I thought it was funny with the little power I had over them.</p><p>But then I met Lelianna.  Someone who deep down used to do what I was doing, but was now I devote religious person.  I didn't care much for the religion, but it made sense to actually act with the grace and nobility that ran through my blood.  I took Lelianna as an example, and throughout the course of our adventures came quite close.</p><p>Alistair, Morrigan, Lelianna, and I went across the land of Fereldan and continued our quest to unite the land.  I learned all about my friend's pasts.  Lelianna and I fell in love I suppose.  Once we ended this blight, we would disappear together.  We would travel the world and see everything there is to see.</p><p>We discovered Alistair's little secret.  He was incredibly reluctant, but he's actually King Calyn's brother and first in line for the Throne of Fereldan.  I could hardly believe it, but Alistair did nothing but whine about it.  He and I talked about a bit and I think I talked some sense into him.  We talked a lot, and he's actually pretty funny.</p><p>Once we reunited our lands, it was time to face that fucker Loghain.  But to truly unite Fereldan, we'd need a King.  Alistair would have to take the throne.  We faced Loghain and totally overthrew him.  It was now my decision between Alistair and Loghain's daughter.  OOOoOhhHHHhhhh..  but what is this?  I can use my persuasion, marry Alistair right now, and become Queen!  Hell yeah!</p><p>Not soon after I made my decision, Alistair really assumed the role as King.  He truly became a great man, and the best character in the whole game.  I'm sorry about having lead on Lelianna, but Alistair had validated my decision and my future is with him.</p><p>And now I'm heading into the final battle to defeat the Archdemon and save the world from this Blight.  After a full month of preparing, this will finally be over.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dragon Age &amp; Difficulty v.

| December 6, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Before getting a chance to play Dragon Age, one thing that several people mentioned about the game was it's difficulty.  "This game is hard!" exclaimed Nick Breckon of Idle Thumbs, "I've died so many times."  A friend of mine also concurred saying that he's died a whole lot in the game as well.  In both cases, they switched the difficulty down to easy just to make it through the game.  These people aren't novice video game players by any means, but was definitely curious.</p><p>Dragon Age is a game where your character has a few different classes to choose from.  You go about the game with a party of character that are different classes as well.  The game has 3 main classes to choose from: Warrior, Rogue and Mage.  And that's typical the order of how complex each character class is.  Warrior's are dirt simple.  You just walk up to an enemy and keep beating on it until it's dead.  Rogues are a little more tricky because they aren't designed for brute strength.  And Mages are typically the most complex because you have many spells to choose from.</p><p>It came as no surprise to me that all the talk I've heard about the game's difficulty were from people playing as a Rogue or a Mage.  Apparently if you're not playing the game to its fullest, it'll kick your ass.  This is why when presented with the choice of class, I went with the Warrior.  I don't want the game to be difficult to the point of frustration.  But I'm still not going to give the game the satisfaction of playing on Easy.</p><p>As playing a Warrior, I've found the game to be pretty damn easy, actually.  I haven't messed around with Tactics.  I accidentally spent my skill points on things that aren't useful.  I'm not paying attention to talents.  I haven't really tweaked anything to fight the most efficient fight.  I was almost never saving on my own.  And I'm still kicking ass, so I guess I must be doing something right.</p><p>At 15 hours into the game I experience my first death, and another hour later I ran into an actual challenge thanks to the Mage Circle.  But my deaths and problems were simply because I was going into the battle without thinking.  At this point the game had trained me to think any battle could be easily won.  For the first time, I had to change the way I approached the battle.  It only took me a couple minutes to utilize the shape shifting you have in the Mage Circle to defeat this cluster of mages and be on my way.</p><p>The game was still pretty much a cake walk until I came across Kolgrim today.  This phoney Spartan was actually the first real challenge I've face in this game.  My tactics of rushing into battle had no effect.  Even focusing on one enemy at a time ended in failure.  For the first time in the game, I was actually stuck.  There was no way I was going to work with Kolgrim and whatever quest he was on.  With the choices I wanted for my story, I would have to fight him and defeat him.</p><p>So, I started actually learning how to play the game correctly.  I looked into all the skills and talents for the first time, I had for my characters and came up with a battle plan that actually used them.  I looked at each character's tactics for the first time, too.  They were all defaults as aggressive to fight the nearest opponent.  What good is that going to do?  If my entire party focused on one enemy at a time, we can get rid of the weaker guys right away and only have Kolgrim left to deal with.</p><p>After just messing around with the options and coming up with an actual plan of attack, I had gotten far further in the battle than I had before.  Learning what the game has to offer, and utilizing it is the real difference between hitting buttons on the control and actually playing the game.  <b>If Dragon Age is "hard", then you're playing it wrong.</b></p><p>Unlike other RPGs, Dragon Age isn't some mindless level grind to overcome your strife.  It comes down to how you play the game, and developing strategies that work.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dragon Age Origins" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age Origins</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| November 24, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, I finally, FINALLY, got a chance to really start playing Dragon Age.  Dragon Age had been sitting on my desk all week, barely touched.  But my Sunday was wide open and void of responsibility, so I took the opportunity to relax in the war torn world.</p><p>Dragon Age is the latest game by Canadian developer, Bioware, the renowned western RPG developer. Dragon Age has been described a spiritual successor to <b>Balder's Gate</b>, Bioware's first established series a developer, but has no ties to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Dragon Age is a completely new IP, which is part of Bioware's company goal to create their own original games, rather than building off of established franchises, such as D&amp;D or Star Wars.</p><p><b>Jade Empire</b> was actually their first IP, but didn't really have the staying power they were hoping for.  <b>Mass Effect</b> was truly their first success on that front.  Mass Effect certainly wasn't my introduction to the Bioware name, but it was the first Bioware game I played and played through to completion.  I loved the environments, and space travel.  The story was pretty engaging, even though the actual character interactions were stoic and lifeless.  But I liked it a lot.</p><p>Dragon Age definitely learns from areas in Mass Effect that fell short, and expands several concepts that make Dragon Age a very well rounded and fantastic experience.</p><div class='title'><b>The Nameless, Speechless Main Character</b></div><p>In Dragon Age, you play a character that you create using a character creator, much like other recent western RPGs of this era (Oblivion, Fallout 3, Mass Effect).  You do not play a scripted defined main character.  Nothing makes me lose interest in a game faster than playing an absolute husk of a human.  At least in Mass Effect, you actually heard your character speak and interact with people.  In Oblivion, Fallout, and Dragon Age, you make your conversation choices but your character says nothing.  You basically play nothing...</p><p>Though, the point of this is to actually "role play" your character.  You make choices on your own and that shapes the story for yourself.  YOU define the character you play, rather than the writers.  The writers are there to merely give you the choices to either act like yourself, play the good guy, or play the bad guy.</p><p>This has never worked for me.  I never feel like I'm making a character.  I'm just making choices and am hardly ever reminded of the consequences.  Some stats go up, some stats go down.  There's no emotional attachment to anything I do.</p><p>But I don't feel unattached to my character in Dragon Age.  My character, who I almost named "Tina Fey", doesn't ever speak a word, but is constantly surrounded by a party of characters who speak their minds.  Every character I've met in Dragon Age has a distinct personality that is something I've never come across in a western RPG, but something you'd have a hard time NOT finding in a Japanese RPG.</p><p>With the choices you make throughout the story of Dragon Age, your party members remember.  When discussing an upcoming battle, or having trouble making a difficult decision, your party members will not hesitate to give their two cents on the situation, and even argue amongst themselves about what is best.  Sometimes you can join their conversation. Afterward, they may complain about it, and you can set them straight, or perhaps smack your self on the head at what a fool you were.</p><p>You may not have a voice of your own, but your party resonates with who you've become as a character and I find that rather engaging and amazing.</p><div class='title'><b>Choices</b></div><p>The choices you make are chiefly made through the conversations you have with other characters in the world.  Those choices found in Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Mass Effect were generally either "Good" choices, "Evil" choices, or "Neutral" choices, which generally make you a "Good", "Evil" or "Neutral" person.</p><p>The choices presented to you in Dragon Age are much more varied.  In fact, to prevent you from thinking in terms of Good or Evil, they've removed your alignment from the UI.  Choices might still be Good or Evil, but the game doesn't judge you in those terms.  Your party members do, though.</p><p>Each of the characters in your party has a Like and Dislike meter and the choices you make will either piss them off or make them think highly of you.  You can walk around with a bunch of the righteous characters and spread love and joy throughout the land.  Or you can surround yourself with assholes and fuck with people.  Or you can mix it up.</p><p>My party has two goodie two-shoes (Alastair, Lelianna) and one bad apple (Morrigan).  Morrigan will always complain when I decide to help out a villager in need.  "Oh god, are we going to help every single beggar that has a problem?  Don't we have more important business?"  But Lelianna can't get enough of it.  In fact, my friendship level with her is starting to get some special privileges, similar to what happens in Mass Effect if you start getting really close to a party member.</p><p>But there's more than just Good and Evil choices.  Good and Evil are only relative to your party members, and really depends on what they think you should be doing.  Some of these choices might be anti-religion or anti-royalty.  You can mind your manors and speak politely, or be a brass asshole.</p><p>For my character, I'm playing a princess whose castle has fallen and family has been completely killed.  Being a woman chosen as a Grey Warden, I'm not putting up with anyone's shit, but I'm still heading the manors I grew up with.  I will not show weakness in any case.  I'm here to prove that a woman will stop this war.  Girl Power!  Lelianna's with me...</p><div class='title'><b>Only 10 hours in...</b></div><p>I started the game bored off my ass, but after spending a good amount of time paying attention to the game and ignoring any distractions, it has totally pulled me in.  Dragon Age is very organic and genuine compared to Mass Effect, but I think both games emulate their environments.</p><p>Mass Effect has some amazing special effects, but deep down is missing the warmth of emotion.  The story focuses on all these things that are going on around you, but you are never affected by them.  No one ever says how they feel or expresses any emotion about the Geth invasion, or Saren.  There's nothing personal.</p><p>Dragon Age is all about the people in this world.  The Horde of Demons is almost identical to the Geth Invasion in Mass Effect, but the people you meet will always mention what they're feeling.  And you have enough dialogue choices that you can add to that conversation.</p><p>I hope the Mass Effect team and Dragon Age team have some cross design ideas that aided the development of both games because without these ideas, I think Mass Effect 2 will be a weaker game.</p><p>Anyways, Dragon Age is pretty great so far.  I just need another uninterrupted weekend day to spend 8 hours with it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Brutal Legend" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/brutal-legend">Brutal Legend</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Brutal Legend is the latest game by Tim Schafer, and stars Jack Black as main character Eddie Riggs.  I think most people probably know this game as "Jack Black's video game."  He definitely has more reach than Schafer, and Black has been in the spotlight for almost all promotion of Brutal Legend.  But, Brutal Legend has Tim Schafer's feel through and through.</p><div class='title'><b>Tim Schafer</b></div><p>Tim Schafer is known for creating games with very solid stories backed by great comedic writing that blends into game design.  His career started at LucasArts in the hay day of PC adventure games.  He co-write and co-designed The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2, and then his role grew larger as he co-directed Day of the Tentacle.  His first true lead role came with <b>Full Throttle</b> in 1995, followed by <b>Grim Fandango</b> in 1998.</p><p>In 2000, he left LucasArts to form his own company, Double Fine Productions.  Their first game was <b>Psychonauts</b> released for PC, Xbox, and PS2 in 2005, which has garnered a very large cult following.</p><p>Psychonauts was my introduction to Tim Schafer.  Unfortunately, I skipped all those great LucasArts adventure games and still haven't gotten back to them.  It was because of its cult following that I finally tracked down a copy in 2007 for Xbox, and it's a pretty hilarious and fun game.</p><div class='title'><b>Psychonauts</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp"  /></p><p>In Psychonauts, you play a child who's been sent to summer camp to learn about psychokinetic powers.  These are taught by the camp counselors.  Trouble arises as many of the kids at the camp have had their brains stolen and have become mindless drones.  Throughout the game you venture into others minds to uncover the mystery and plot.</p><p>Psychonauts has some pretty funny characters with great writing.  The real comedy is the level design of the world's that exist inside of character's minds.  The characters are pretty goofy on the outside.  On the inside, their world is imbued with their theme.  There's a very strict and meticulous character, who's inner world is nothing but a cube.  There's a disco queen, who's inner world is a massive disco dance party.  One of my favorite levels is when you inhabit the mind of a fish, and its world puts you as a monster crushing the city beneath you.</p><p>The game itself is mostly platforming.  The camp is open world, and levels can be revisited to find all the secret crap.  Psychonauts definitely has its problems, but the writing and design created lovable characters and a memorable experience.  Brutal Legend follows that tradition very well but takes that blend of comedy, story, and game design even further.</p><div class='title'><b>Brutal Legend</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp"  /></p><p>For Brutal Legend, Schafer created a medieval world based out of his fandom for Heavy Metal music.  During his interview on Jimmy Fallon, Schafer said that, as a kid, all his Heavy Metal albums would have elaborately designed mountains and worlds of explosions, fire and brimstone.  He wanted to make a game where you could actually walk around in one of these worlds and see what it was like.  You can see that in almost all environments in the game.  The first areas have exhaust pipe trees, and steel bladed branches.  There are massive rock effigies of Band symbols, skulls and bones of gigantic beasts.</p><p>In this land, humans are used as slaves and pitted against one another while the demon lords usurp them for their own power and rule.  You, as Eddie Riggs, rescue these humans and build an army to eventually overthrow their rule.  In the world of Heavy Metal, building an army is a lot like building a band and a fan base.  You recruit headbangers, guitarists, roadies and plenty others.</p><p>The game itself is completely action/adventure, but features many instances where you team up with your troops to attack enemies.  You can command your troops to follow, attack, and defend.  These concepts explode further into a full on RTS battle.  You build merchandise booths over vents to hell to collect fans.  These fans are used to create units for battle.  The battle is won when you destroy the opposing team's stage on the other end of the field.  The RTS battles can also be played against people, which is the Multiplayer mode in Brutal Legend.</p><p>As the game explains, Roadies aren't the ones in the spotlight.  But they do direct and shape much of the concert experience.  If they do their job correctly, no one will even know that they're there.</p><div class='title'><b>Jack Black and casting</b></div><p>Schafer wanted to create an experience that die hard Heavy Metal fans would absolutely love and enjoy.  Also from that Fallon interview, Schafer mentioned that throughout initial production and design, he kept thinking to himself, "man, I hope (noted Heavy Metal super-fan) Jack Black will like our game."  When it came time to actually cast the role of the main character, it was a no-brainer to reach out to Jack Black and see if he'd be interested.</p><p>Many of the other characters in the game are voiced by notable Heavy Metal musicians, such as Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford of The Runaways, and Rob Halford of Judas Priest, all of whom basically play personas of themselves.  Additional voice work includes Tim Curry, Kyle Gass, David Cross, Steve Agee, and Brian Posehn (who actually went to high school with Schafer).</p><div class='title'><b>Heavy Metal</b></div><p>In another interview, Schafer has said that Brutal Legend should cater to Heavy Metal fans, but should not be so niche that the general public won't get most of the references.  I'm not a Heavy Metal fan by any means, but the casting and environments are pretty obvious.  Another interesting parallel which is probably more apparent to Heavy Metal fans, are the subtle comments towards the history of Heavy Metal.</p><p>Brutal Legend begins in present day with Eddie Riggs working with a "Metal" band called Kabbage Boy.  Kabbage Boy is a bunch of teen kid bringing Pop into Metal.  Riggs and another roadie talk about how kids these days just don't understand Heavy Metal and how Metal is dead.  "The early 70s were really the days of Heavy Metal."</p><p>After being sent back in time, the first major story arc is helping Lars (Rob Halford) and Lita (Lita Ford) overthrow current slavedriver, Lionwhyte.  Lionwhyte is a makeup donned pretty boy with massive hair and leather pants, a obvious parody of David Bowie in the 80s.</p><p>Much like those kids in the opening adding horrible current Pop culture into Heavy Metal, David Bowie and other Glam Rock bands did the same back in the 80s.  They were in the music because of the style and dressing up rather than the actual music.  Defeating Lionwhyte/Bowie serves as justice to all Heavy Metal fans out there.</p><p>After defeating Lionwhyte, some story occurs and the main love interest kills herself.  She's consumed and infected with in the Sea of Black Tears and becomes completely emo.  She returns to take you down, dressed in all black with blue skin and heavy eyeliner.  She raises her army from the dead, who are a bunch of emo kids with black hair and spikes.</p><p>Ophellia's return represents the rise of Death Metal in the 90s.  Heavy Metal thought there were finally done with the complete nonsense of Glam Rock, but now they have to deal with something far worse.  Eventually you defeat these emo brats and show that Heavy Metal fans are truly the best.</p><div class='title'><b>The Perfect Package</b></div><p>I'm not sure that this concept would work with any other music genre.  Heavy Metal has a history of branching sub-genres that the core fanbase hates that work as fantastic villains.  Heavy Metal has deep roots in Norse mythology, which paint a vibrant medieval landscape.  There are axes and swords and fire and demons.  Studded arm bands.  Skimpy dressed chicks riding fire beasts..</p><p>Everything in Brutal Legend works within the aspects of the Story, Gameplay and the theme of Heavy Metal.  Schafer may have ran into some problems with Psychonauts, but he definitely learned from them.  <b>Brutal Legend is one of the best designed games in a while</b>, and it never takes itself too seriously.  It's fun to play and fun to watch as well. ^_^</p><p>Definitely play this game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Katamari Forever" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/katamari-forever">Katamari Forever</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 4, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Katamari is a pretty simple game.  You roll up stuff, the Katamari gets larger, and The King of All Cosmos takes your ball of garbage (your Katamari), throws it in the sky and POOF! becomes a planet or a star or some other objects floating around in space.  Usually it's replacing something in space that The King had accidentally destroyed in the prologue story sequence.</p><p>In Katamari Damacy, released in 2004, you did exactly that.  There were 10 core levels to the game.  At the end of each level, you ended up with a larger Katamari than the last.  In the first levels, you were picking up dice, Mahjong pieces, maybe magazines.  Throughout the game, you'd grow larger enough to pick up humans, cars, houses, buildings, mountains, and islands..  In the final level, you'd end up with a Katamari almost 900m in diameter.</p><p>It was a unique game that stood on its own as a single release.  But with great popular, Namco demanded creator Keita Takahashi make a sequel.  He thought about what he would do to further the brand, and in 2005, released We Love Katamari.  The story of We Love Katamari centered on Takahashi's reaction to the outpouring support of Katamari Damacy.  Each level in the game is a request by a fan of Katamari Damacy, and almost all the levels center on unique challenges or environments rather than rolling the large Katamari possible.</p><p>Keita Takahashi said that Katamari should end at We Love Katamari, and went off to do something else with Namco.  Namco continued to milk this cash cow and put Jun Moriwaki as head Katamari game designer.  They released Me and My Katamari on the PSP in 2005/2006, which was god awful.  How can you have a Katamari game without analog sticks?</p><p>In 2007, Namco and Jun Moriwaki released Beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, the true sequel to We Love Katamari.  Unfortunately, Beautiful Katamari was uninspired and felt incredibly empty.  It suffered from numerous principle problems (<a href="/old/v7/beautiful-katamari-impressions" title="/beautiful-katamari-impressions">thoughts from Oct 23 2007</a>), but in its core, it was Katamari (<a href="/old/v7/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts" title="/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts">thoughts from Oct 24 2007</a>).  With the unoriginal story, horrible loading times, and $12 worth of DLC to make the game complete, Takahashi's original gameplay concept will always shine through.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever</b></div><p>2 weeks ago, on the 5 year Anniversary of Katamari Damacy (in the US), Namco released Katamari Forever, the newest Katamari game.  Even though, it's a "new" game, Katamari Forever is a compilation of "greatest hits" of the Katamari franchise.  It's chiefly comprised of levels from Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari.  It has 3 new levels that are unique to Katamari Forever.</p><p>It's strange that they completely ignored levels from Me and My Katamari.  Though, I never really played it because it was too difficult to control.  Maybe all those levels were from We Love Katamari?</p><p>Even though, they're the same levels, Katamari Forever has given them a modern treatment:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>All these levels have been upscaled to full 1080p.  Once you complete the level, you have your choice of 4 separate graphical representations of the level:  Cell-shaded, Wood-grain, Comic Book, and Classic.  I like the new Cell-shaded approach.  All the objects in the environment are clearly visible.</li><br/>	<li>Loading each level is lightning fast and takes 5 seconds at the most.  Unlike We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari, there is absolutely no loading at all during the level, which there shouldn't have been to begin with.</li><br/>	<li>In previous games, when you grew to the next size, the smaller objects would "pop out" of the environment to keep a reasonable amount of objects on screen at once.  With the optimized power of modern hardware, these smaller objects stick around for a little while longer.</li><br/></ul><br/>Katamari Forever has also added 2 new elements of gameplay, which are rather helpful:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>You can jump!  Though, it's a real pain in the ass to use the Sixaxis controls to jump, you can just use the R2 button instead.  It's really handy for getting to places you couldn't previously</li><br/>	<li>Throughout the level, you might find a heart.  There are broken hearts and full hearts.  When you roll one up it will suck up surrounding objects into your Katamari.  In practice, it's much less broken than that sounds.</li><br/></ul><br/>If you don't like these new features, you can roll in "Classic" mode which removes all hearts from the level, and removes jumping.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever Levels</b></div><p>Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari, and Beautiful Katamari each have about 20 or so levels.  Katamari Forever took its levels from that bank of 60, and has a total of 34 levels.  Here's the list of levels you'll find in Katamari Forever</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RoboKing's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Tutorial</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star 1 - Playtime</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Delightful Dirigible)<br/><b>Make a Star 2 - Calories</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Munchies Manor)<br/><b>Make a Star 3 - Rich</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Lady Luck Casino)<br/><b>Make a Star 4 - Constellations</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Hubble Horoscope)<br/><b>Make a Star 5 - Underwater</b> (We Love Katamari - Inner Tube Guy - Underwater Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 6 - Animals</b> (We Love Katamari - Tan Dog - Friend Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 7 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 4)<br/><b>Make a Star 8 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Old Guy - As Large As Possible 3)<br/><b>Make a Star 9 - Energy</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dynaville)<br/><b>Make a Star 10 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 8)<br/><b>Make a Star 11 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Bird/Elephant As Large as Possible 5)<br/><b>Make the Moon</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make the Moon)<br/><b>Katamari Sprinkler</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star - Race</b> (We Love Katamari - Racecar Guy - Racetrack Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star - Danger</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dangerous Colony)<br/><b>Farewell!</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The King's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Gingerbread House</b> (We Love Katamari - Hansel &amp; Gretel - Candy Stage)<br/><b>Clean Up</b> (We Love Katamari - Cleaning Lady - 100 Objects Stage)<br/><b>Cows and Bears</b> (We Love Katamari - Cow/Bear guy - Cow/Bear Stage)<br/><b>Money</b> (We Love Katamari - "Save the Pandas" Guy - Money Stage)<br/><b>Fireflies</b> (We Love Katamari - Studying Guy - Firefly Stage)<br/><b>Sumo</b> (We Love Katamari - Mini Sumo - Sumo Stage)<br/><b>Shopping</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Fancy &amp; Schmancy)<br/><b>School</b> (We Love Katamari - Teacher - School Stage)<br/><b>Camp</b> (We Love Katamari - Campfire Guy - Fireball Stage)<br/><b>Limited to 50</b> (We Love Katamari - Baby - 50 Item Limit Stage)<br/><b>Snowman</b> (We Love Katamari - Snow Guy - Snowman Stage)<br/><b>Hot Stuff</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Roller Roaster)<br/><b>Small Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Small Just-right)<br/><b>Medium Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Medium Just-right)<br/><b>Large Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Large Just-right)<br/><b>Wake up the King</b> (Beautfiul Katamari - Schloss Kosmos)<br/><b>The King's Dream</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p>Katamari Forever has the unique variety of challenges found in We Love Katamari and, to a lesser extent, Beautiful Katamari, along with the growing scale found throughout all the games in the series.</p><p>Unfortunately, the scale is very scattered.  There's no sense of starting off small and eventually growing large from level to level.  By the time you've gotten to "Make a Star 7", which is The House from Katamari Damacy, the first level where you're big enough to roll up humans, you've already rolled up cars in "Cows and Bears" and horses in "Constellations".  Katamari Forever doesn't start building up scale a few levels after that.</p><p>I remember the first time in Katamari Damacy when I rolled up that little girl in The House.  In each level before that, you could roll up small animals, but the game made a point of making humans just a little bit too large for you to capture.  It wasn't until you completed The House, and rolled large enough afterward that you could envelope that girl.  It really made you work for it.  In the next level, you had to work at it again.  This time you could roll up adults, if you made it well past the level's goal.</p><p>Besides being inconsistent, New-comers to the Katamari series will have no concept of this at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Though, this game is really made for the fans.  Most of the best levels from the 3 core games of the franchise are in one spot.  They play and look better than they ever have before, so I can't complain too much.  I no longer have to wait through horrible load times in We Love Katamari or Beautiful Katamari...  I can pop in Katamari Forever and roll away pretty quickly.</p><p>Unfortunately, after a week of playing, I've almost unlocked everything.  Playing these level for a second time is pretty fun, but I've already played them to death in their original games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp"  /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghostbusters" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I'm a huge fan of the Ghostbusters.  Like many people my age, I grew up with the movies and Saturday morning TV show.  I used to pretend I was a Ghostbuster, and run around the backyard with my friends busting ghosts.  Recently, I started getting into the <em>spirit</em> of things thanks to hearing the Ghostbusters theme song at every 80s Night @ Inferno.</p><p>So when I first saw that demo-real footage of this game that popped up online out of the blue back in early 2008, I was completely blown away (ign.com).  Not only was it a next-gen Ghostbustin' game, but it looked really really good.  It didn't look like some cobbled together FPS.  It looked very fluid and real.  Amazing.</p><p>Since this footage came out of nowhere, no one seemed to know anything about it.  A couple days later, after the blogs had done all their research, fact finding and scooping, I knew a little bit more about it.  It was slated for a Fall 2008 release, and was developed by Terminal Reality, whose credits were somewhat poor.  Blood Rayne was their only claim to fame.</p><p>But it looked great, and after a shaky delay due to loss of publisher, Atari picked up the Distribution rights and it finally came out June 16th 2009 (20 years after Ghostbusters II premiered in theaters).</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>A couple weeks after that, Gamely finally sent me a copy for the Playstation 3 and so far, I've been having a great time with it.  Ghostbusters is pretty damn fun. ^_^</p><p>Zach and Justin had mentioned how much they were enjoying the game.  They commented that it was like being in a Ghostbusters film.  And I'd have to agree with them so far.  Egon, Ray, Venkman, and Winston are perfect renditions of their original roles.</p><p>I should hope so considering this game was even possible thanks to Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis.  They wrote and developed the story and got everyone back to reprise their original roles.  Bill Murray, Ernie Hudson, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis are all voices their original characters.  Annie Potts returns as Janine.  William Atherton returns as Walter Peck.  They've also got Brian Doyle-Murray as the Mayor, and Alyssa Milano as the female lead.</p><p>And this cast works fantastic together.  The dialogue and character balance works perfectly together and forms a new, completely unique entry to the Ghostbusters franchise.  This really feels like the "next" Ghostbusters.  In fact, Dan Aykroyd has said in an interview, "This is essentially the third movie."</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>In Ghostbusters, you play as a new recruit.  You don't actually play one of the original Ghostbusters.  (Though, you might in Multiplayer.. I don't know).  Your character rarely ever speaks, and even though you're the one doing the bulk of the Ghostbustin', you really are on the side lines for the story.</p><p>It actually works out perfectly.  This is the <b>first game</b> in which I play the silent "main" character, and feel like I'm totally immersed in the game's story.  Maybe that's because I'm not the main character.  I'm part of an ensemble cast.  They're the real stars and I'm the support.  For the most part, I'm watching them unravel the story, and speak their hilarious lines.</p><p>But, I'm still totally part of their group.  Bustin' Ghosts is completely a team effort.  They'll throw out their traps while I've captured a ghost in my proton stream.  They'll revive me if I'm knocked down.  And I do the same for them.  They're my pals!</p><div class='title'><b>Virtual Monument</b></div><p>Many of the areas in the game are 3D imaginings of places from the movies.  You can walk around the Ghostbuster HQ, you go to the Sedgewick Hotel featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go to the New York Public Library, also featured in Ghostbusters 1.  You go the Historical Museum, as featured in Ghostbusters 2.</p><p>You also come across many artifacts from the two movies.  In fact, the painting of Vigo (from Ghostbusters II) is sitting in the garage of the Ghostbuster HQ.  There are tons of references from the original movies, as well as pop culture from the late 80s.</p><p>Taking a virtual tour of these sets reminds me a lot of <b>Lost Via Domus</b>.  In the Lost game, you play a new character and discover the world of Lost for yourself.  You can walk around the hatch, the beach, the pearl station.  You find artifacts like the VW bus, the 2 skeletons.  You follow the river through the Jungle.  The characters are voiced by their actual actors.  I wrote about this back on <a href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus" title="/lost-via-domus">August 24th, 2008</a>.  It's a virtual world.</p><p>Of course, the big difference is that Ghostbusters the game was written and "created" by their original cast and creators.  Lost Via Domus was a simple fan fiction written by huge fans of the show, who happen to work at Ubisoft.</p><div class='title'><b>Perfect Pacing</b></div><p>Ghostbusters is pretty linear, and has some very gamey pacing.  The game is split up into several different missions.  Chapters, really.  Each chapter is about 2 or 3 hours long depending on how much time you waste blowing stuff up, or searching for artifacts.</p><p>In my opinion, 2 to 3 hours is a perfect length for a chapter.  It's just long enough that you can get through a chapter in one sitting. After you finish a chapter, everyone is back at Ghostbusters HQ figuring out what to do next.  It's the perfect point to set down the controls for the next time you get back to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Definitely Play this Game!</b></div><p>If you are or were a fan of the Ghostbusters and LOVE nostalgia, you definitely need to play this game.  I would still suggest renting it though as $60 is still quite a price to pay.</p><p>One thing to note, the Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions are identical and were the ones written by the original cast. The Wii, Playstation 2, Nintendo DS, and PSP versions were developed by some other developer and are probably utter crap.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to More Metroid Errata" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/more-metroid-errata">More Metroid Errata</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 16, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>There's a couple other things I'd like to mention concerning Metroid before I drop the subject for a while.  I find it somewhat odd that I've had Metroid on the brain so much since the announcement of Metroid Other M.  I'm a huge Zelda fan, but I guess I never really considered myself that big of a Metroid fan.  I think a lot of that fandom was taken away by Metroid Prime</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b></div><p>I think the Metroid Prime series adds a whole lot of glitz and glamor and takes away from some of the charm and prestige that Metroid garnished on the Super Nintendo.  I thought it was nice that they took it a different direction than Legend of Zelda for the transition to 3D, but it felt empty.  There was no emotion in the game.</p><p>Anyways, I still think Metroid Prime 1 and Metroid Prime 3 are pretty fun games.  And I think what makes Metroid Prime 3 so great is the fluid controls of the Wii-mote.  So far I think it's one of the best designed games on the Wii.</p><p><b>Luckily!</b>, Nintendo is re-hashing many of their Gamecube classics with Wii-mote / Nunchuck "enhanced" controls.  Nintendo has announced that in August, they'll release <b>Metroid Prime Trilogy</b>.  A collection of all 3 Metroid Prime games with Wii-controls for a mere $50.</p><p>For those of you who missed Metroid Prime 1 or 2, or who loved the new controls of Metroid Prime 3, this is the perfect opportunity to revisit these games and experience the full "story" arc of the Metroid Prime series.</p><div class='title'><b>The Emotion of Super Metroid</b></div><p>I think what makes Super Metroid so rich are the emotional moments experienced between Samus and her Metroid hatchling.  Samus found the Metroid hatching after traversing the depths of SR388 uncovering a horrible grotesque plot of Metroid mutation.  The Metroid hatching thinks of Samus as her mother, and there are a couple moments where this mother/child relation fosters itself into something few games did at that time.</p><p>2 years ago, Chad Concelmo of Destructriod wrote an article that focused primarily on this aspect of the game in full detail.  It's a great read: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/the-memory-card-01-the-return-of-baby-metroid-31238.phtml">The Memory Card .01: The return of Baby Metroid</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid 2 - fan remake</b></div><p>Metroid 2 is probably the most difficult to replay out of any Metroid game.  Released in 1992 for the Game Boy, Metroid II has not been officially re-released since its debut.  Every Metroid game except Metroid 2 can be played on a modern gaming device.  (Unless you discount the DS Lite due to the DSi release)  You'd need to find a Gameboy Advance in order to play Metroid 2.</p><p>Anyways, Project AM2R has been working on a remake of the game to make it more playable for today's generation.</p><p>Here's their most recent trailer:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="640" height="505" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="640" height="505" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fbsH5rGqL7o&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>It looks pretty fantastic. ^_^.  Check 'em out at <a href="http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/" title="http://metroid2remake.blogspot.com/">http://metroid2remake.blogpost.com/</a>.</p><p>I wonder how long it'll be before Nintendo shuts them down.</p><div class='title'><b>Metal Metroid</b></div><p>The song in the background of that trailer totally reminds me Metroid Metal.  Metroid Metal is a group of dudes who've repraised many of the songs throughout the Metroid series in the Metal Rock genre.  Their tracks are pretty slick.</p><p>Check 'em out @ <a href="http://metroidmetal.com/" title="http://metroidmetal.com/">Metroid Metal dot Com</a></p><p><b>News!</b>: As you may have noticed from their website, Metroid Metal will be playing Live at the Penny Arcade Expo this year.  Spiffy!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid in the Second Dimension" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-in-the-second-dimension">Metroid in the Second Dimension</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 14, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When Metroid Prime was released in 2002, Nintendo finally had their answer to western First Person Shooters.  Golden Eye and Perfect Dark were legends, but NOW! Nintendo had one of their core franchises in the FPS spotlight.  And felt they had something that contended with the Halo crowd on the Xbox.</p><p>Metroid Prime was the first Metroid game since Super Metroid released 8 years prior, so it was a pretty big deal considering the success of Super Metroid.  Nintendo created Retro Studios, an American based developer who jumped at the chance to make this game.  Shigeru Miyamoto and Yoshio Sakamoto were in regular contact to make sure the game was within Nintendo's vision.</p><p>The third dimension worked great for Nintendo and Metroid Prime became the Gamecube's #6 best selling games of all time with 2.7 million units.  2.7 million doesn't sound like a lot, but keep in mind only 21.7 million Gamecubes were sold worldwide.  Over 10% attach rate is not bad.  (Side Note: Super Smash Brothers Melee is the best selling Gamecube game at 6.1 million units sold, which is a little over 25%.)</p><p>2 years later, Retro Studios released Metroid Prime 2 which continued where Metroid Prime 1 left off.  The FPS gameplay had become iconic for the Metroid series and the idea of a 2D side scrolling adventure became more of a treasured memory of Super Metroid.</p><p>Though, <b>those traditional roots have not been forgotten!</b> They've been merely overshadowed by the graphical splendor.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Fusion</b></div><p>Metroid Fusion is the <b>actual sequel to Super Metroid</b>.  In fact, the opening credits say Metroid 4.  I think this game get overlooked because it was <b>released on the exact same day as Metroid Prime</b>.  Gamers were far more interested in the new fresh look on the Gamecube, rather than an outdated gaming experience on the Gameboy Advance.</p><p>Metroid Fusion's development was headed by Yoshio Sakamoto and everyone else who worked on Super Metroid.  Nintendo still wanted a traditional follow-up to Super Metroid, so they did.  And on November 17th, 2002, fans got a traditional sequel with Metroid Fusion and a fresh perspective on the series with Metroid Prime.  But gamers made their choice.  Where Metroid Prime ultimately sold 2.7 million, Metroid Fusion sold just a little over 1 million.  Metroid Prime was the star.</p><p>Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime are interesting entries in the series.  It's interesting in that Metroid Prime had a radically different way to play the game, but the design was incredibly traditional.  It had the familiar look of Samus and all the same items you remembered from Super Metroid.  Metroid Fusion played the exact same way you remembered from Super Metroid, but the story and character designs were quite different than what you remembered.</p><p>Metroid Fusion has a bunch of cutscenes, text and dialogue that progress the story.  There's actual plot!  The environment, characters, and enemies are all <b>very cohesive</b> and build a decent story.  Unfortunately, the game is incredibly linear which is a big negative for a traditional Metroid.  The game opens up once you beat it, but <b>there are power-ups you can miss!</b> What the hell is that crap?!</p><p>Through and though, Metroid Fusion isn't half bad.  <b>If you liked Super Metroid, I'd totally recommend it</b>. ^_^  Now that I know what happens in Metroid Fusion, <b>I'm pretty interested to see how Metroid Other M fits in to the story.</b> Though, as a big fan of Super Metroid, Metroid Fusion was a let down.  It's good, but not Super Metroid good.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Zero Mission</b></div><p>Metroid Prime 1 was pretty sweet and made Metroid Prime 2 just as highly anticipated.  So much so, that you may have overlooked the very fantastic <b>Metroid Zero Mission</b> released 6 months prior.  You may have also overlooked it because it's a remake.  You may have also overlooked it because word of mouth said Metroid Fusion wasn't so great.  You may have overlooked it because it's on the Gameboy Advance and not the Gamecube.  Whatever...</p><p>Metroid Zero Mission is a remake of the first entry in the series, the original 1986 Metroid.  It's nearly identical through and through, but with tighter graphics, faster, more responsive controls, and more weapons than Super Metroid and Metroid Fusion.  Plus, Zero Mission extends the original Plot to fit better into the overall time line of the Metroid series.</p><p><b>Metroid Zero Mission is fantastic</b>.  It is every bit as good as Super Metroid. And it's sad that it's one of the poorest selling titles in the series at around half a million units sold worldwide.</p><p>After finishing Metroid Fusion, I played a little Zero Mission for the first time in a while and it is so smooth.  Metroid Fusion is like a step back.  Half the time, Samus doesn't move how I want her to move.  The same is with going back to Super Metroid.  Those controls are outdated and Metroid Zero Mission is incredibly modern.</p><p>Much like Super Metroid is to the Super Nintendo, Metroid Zero Mission is one of the best games the Gameboy Advance has to offer.  <b>If you're a fan of Super Metroid, you've got to play this game.</b></p><div class='title'><b>Metroid Other M perspective</b></div><p>Playing through these Metroid games only feed my hype for Metroid Other M.  This is the first game that Yoshio Sakamoto has been deeply involved with since Metroid Zero Mission.  But I don't want to get my hopes up too much.</p><p>It seems like Sakamoto's development team can't really handle the 3rd dimension.  Their original Metroid game for Nintendo 64 Disk Drive was scrapped because it was a mess.  Then, Retro Studios picked up the project and basically started completely over.  The same thing was probably going on again with Project M, until they brought in Team Ninja to bring the 3D nature of the game up to quality.</p><p>I really wonder where Metroid 64 fits into the time line.  Did they take the story and recode it as Metroid Fusion?  Or Do you think this story will finally see the light of day as Metroid Other M?  I think it's probably the latter.  I'm guessing that Metroid Other M is the final product of Metroid 64.  Since it's story was probably too big for the Gameboy Advance.  And Sakamoto probably wanted to keep this story close by rather than let Retro take it.</p><p>Anyways, I'm thinking too much into this.  Metroid Other M won't even be released for another year, and all this speculation and conjecture is really only based on the trailer and <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">Jeremy Parish's interview</a>.  It'll really just build it up to something that won't fit my dream.  Who knows, though.  It's fun to be surprised.</p><p>Previous thoughts on Metroid Other M: <a href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m" title="/metroid-other-m">June 3rd</a>.</p><p><b>Anyways, check out Metroid Zero Mission.</b> ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Metroid Other M" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/metroid-other-m">Metroid Other M</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the grand finale of Nintendo's Press Conference yesterday, Reggie asked the rhetorical questions, "Could a new edgier game, also be coming from us? ...  We've partnered with a development team with a <em>proven track record</em> in the <em>mature</em> space to give us a <em>fresh take</em> at a <em>storied</em> franchise. .. Here's the preview."</p><p>They rolled the clip, which immediately began with Team Ninja's company intro.  "Project M presents" emerges from a space field of meteors.  "Project M" had been a secret project or team floating around the Wii for a while.  Some stuff in the trailer happens, Samus appears, and title "Metroid Other M" materializes before our eyes.</p><p>Even though most people figured that the M in "Project M" probably stood for Metroid rather than Mario, it's nice to see some confirmation. ^_^  But the addition of Team Ninja is a bit of a shocker.  Team Ninja is about as un-Nintendo as you can get.  They're the development team behind such hits as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series.  They pride themselves on flashy over-the-top Anime-style action gameplay and sequence.  Where as Nintendo is pretty traditional and conservative about their games.  I don't think you could get a "fresh"er look than that.</p><p>The trailer showed a whole lot of action with Samus flipping and hopping around the areas physically beating up enemies, as well as firing them down with her plasma gun.  The trailer also showed several clips of full-fledged cutscenes, which is something Metroid has never done before.</p><p>My immediate gut reaction was not very pleasant.  The Metriod series has always stood for exploration. Adding in all these action sequences feels like they're cheapening the name.</p><div class='title'><b>To the rescue!</b></div><p>Luckily, Jeremy Parish conducted an interview with Team Ninja's Yusuke Hayashi and Project M's Yoshio Sakamoto and asked the hard hitting questions: <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587</a></p><p>His asked a question that dug into the heart of what I wanted to know.  "How do your two completely different game design patterns fit together and still keep Metroid faithful?"  They assured Parish, that Metroid Other M is definitely an exploratory game.  It's just the fire fights have been choreographed with the precision we'd expect from Team Ninja.</p><p>Having Project M head the actual game planning put me at ease about the whole Team Ninja thing.  It sounds like they've wanted to (or were pushed into) develop a "true" 3D Metroid game, but had a little trouble with how they were to implement they actual gameplay.  That's where Team Ninja helped them out. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>Parish went on to ask Sakamoto about where Other M falls into the Metriod timeline, to which he replied, "It's part of the flow, story-wise, between Super Metroid and Fusion."  Which makes sense since the trailer ends with a cinematic of the final scene of Super Metroid.</p><p>The actual chronological order of the Metroid games is all over the map.  It's used to be so easy, but then Metroid Prime was thrown in the mix between Metroid 1 and 2... and then the subsequent releases could do whatever they wanted.</p><p>Here's what it looks like now, as taken from the <a href="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline" title="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline">Metroid Wikia</a>:</p><p>Metroid (NES, 1986) / Metroid Zero Mission (GBA, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime (GC, 2002)<br/>Metroid Prime Hunters (DS, 2006)<br/>Metroid Prime 2 (GC, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime 3 (Wii, 2007)<br/>Metroid 2 (GB, 1991)<br/>Super Metroid (Snes, 1994)<br/><b>Metroid Other M</b> (Wii, 2010)<br/>Metroid Fusion (GBA, 2002)</p><div class='title'><b>Project M explained</b></div><p>To end with, Sakamoto returns to explain what is Project M.  It turns out that Project M is a collaboration of 3 companies working on Other M.  There's the Nintendo team, headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, co-creator of the Metroid series.  There's Team Ninja, headed by Yusuke Hayashi.  And a Third team responsible for the cinematic and game visuals.</p><div class='title'><b>Crisis Averted</b></div><p>After reading that interview, I'm totally excited for Metroid Other M.  It's a new Metroid game designed by the core Metroid team!  Finally!</p><p>Though, they've mentioned Metroid Fusion quite a bit in this Interview.  When released, Metroid Fusion  had some mediocre reviews.  Personally, I never got around to playing it, but I've heard the progress is fairly linear.  Hopefully Metroid Other M will stick to its full exploratory roots that they claim it will.</p><div class='title'><b>The sequel curse</b></div><p>Come to think of it, the Metroid series has a very interesting patterns emerging from its sequels, not unlike the Star Trek series.  All the odd numbered releases are amazing, but the even releases miss the point, or aren't as fun.  Let's see here...</p><p>1986: Metroid 1 ++ new and different!<br/>1991: Metroid 2 -- linear and weird<br/>1994: Super Metroid ++ Best game ever made<br/>2002: Metroid Fusion -- linear again and kinda weird<br/>2002: Metroid Prime ++ Fresh!<br/>2004: Metroid Prime 2 -- horribly unoriginal and dumb<br/>2004: Metroid Zero Mission ++ Excellent!<br/>2006: Metroid Prime Hunters -- forgotten and weird<br/>2007: Metroid Prime 3 ++ Not Bad!<br/>2010: Metroid Other M +/-  thumbs down?!</p><p>So...  does that mean in 2010 we'll be dissapointed?  Pfft.. it's just a silly curse.  Star Trek XI (aka JJ Abrams' Star Trek) is an odd numbered Star Trek and it's pretty damn spiffy.  Curses are meant to be broken.  (or was that "promises are meant to be broken")<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews/6">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews/4">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
