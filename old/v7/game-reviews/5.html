| September 12, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>SPOILERS!!</b></div><p>Catherine is about Vincent.  He's been in a long term relationship with Katherine (with a K) for about 3 years (i think?).  And one day, on April 1st, they are talking in a cafe, and Katherine makes a few passive aggressive mentions about their future.  Later on, at the neighborhood bar, Vincent is chatting up his friends, they take off, and he meets "the girl of his dreams," named Catherine (with a C).  She's the sexiest thing he's ever seen.  After a rough nightmare, he wakes up beside her.  They spent the night together, and now he has cheated on Katherine (with a K).</p><p>While the story makes it out to question your ideas of relationships and love, it really boils down to a morality meter.  Do you want to side with Katherine or with Catherine?  Do you want to pursue your long-term relationship and finally "settle" down, or is this random encounter your ticket out of this jail sentence?  The game poses a series of blunt questions, subtle responses to texts, and responses to other people in similar situations.  Each answer moves to the meter back and forth.</p><p>I should probably mention how I played the game.  I'm not currently in any relationship what-so-ever, and don't really care to be.  I've had love in the past, but I'm over it, and don't really care anymore.  My responses to the life questions posed by Catherine (the game) mirrored this in the beginning.  I was neutral.  I floated in the middle.</p><p>Unfortunately, the game threw a cruel twist at me that I decided to believe.  Katherine said she was pregnant.  That's when my alignment changed and I had to start thinking of kids.  While it's pretty awesome that I personally don't have any kids, given the opportunity of being thrust into fatherhood, I would embrace it.  Someday, I do want kids.</p><p>So from that point on my opinion changed, and my responses to the questions started moving more towards the "stick with your wife" angle.  I was still answering everything as honestly as I could.  I wasn't trying to "game" the system towards any specific ending.  I mean, while I don't really want to be in a relationship right now, if I were in a relationship, I would answer something differently.  And that was reflected in the game.</p><p>These questions are meant to guide you through the story to your ultimate ending, but the story is horribly linear.  Vincent doesn't stand up for himself AT ALL.  He continues to let everything spiral out of control around him with the idea that he has no control over the situation.</p><p>Despite my test responses telling Catherine to fuck off, Vincent continues to sleep with her throughout the week.  While actually talking with Catherine, Vincent doesn't say a god damn word.  The entire game is Vincent constantly thinking to himself about what he should do, rather than actually speaking with Catherine or Katherine.</p><p>How the hell is this guy in a long term relationship when they never see each other, or talk about anything?  Even when texting Katherine, your only choices are bullshit passive aggression.  It's either "I'm sorry" or "Don't worry about me."  You can't actually say anything, or talk about anything.  There's no way of coming clean immediately.  And you NEVER see each other either.  How is this a relationship in the first place?!  A relationship is not some one-sided dialogue.</p><p>Things continue to spiral out of control, and Vincent never does anything about them at all.  It's fucking stupid.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Equally stupid is the way you play the game.  The game takes place over 8 or 9 days.  Each night of the week, Vincent has a nightmare.  The large amount of the game is played during the nightmare, and it's an action puzzle game.  You move around blocks on the wall, and climb up to the tippy top.</p><p>In reality, all men unfaithful men are being subjected to these nightmares.  If you do not reach the top in your dreams, you fall.  And when you fall, you die in real life.  Throughout the course of the game, anyone who dies in the dream, shows up on the news the next day as a new victim of the "curse."</p><p>You can prevent some of these deaths from happening, too.  Vincent meets several other people in his nightmare.  Sharing techniques, and talking about the problems they're facing in real life will help them solve them, and they'll survive the nightmares.</p><p>Catherine (the game) plays off the nightmares as a metaphoric representation of the relationship stress Vincent is going through in his real life.  And it works really well in that context, but it's so divorced from the actual plot that I wish I could just skip it all.  Nothing I do during the climbing sequence has any reflection on the story or plot, so it's completely useless.  You could plug any other type of game during these sequences, and it wouldn't change anything.</p><p>When climbing up these walls, all I can think about is wanting to get back to the real world, tell off Catherine, talk with Katherine and fix everything.  I played the game on <b>Easy</b> difficulty so I could fly through these sequences as fast as possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Catherine has 8 endings overall.  Throughout the game, the morality meter is displayed and can guide you towards a specific goal.  You'll either side with Catherine or with Katherine.  You can side with yourself as well by staying in the middle.</p><p>Throughout the final challenge, you are given a series of questions that no longer test your morality, but your resolve to stand by those choices.  These are presented to you as every other question has throughout the game.  They aren't as blunt as saying, "are you sure?".  They are truly (trying) to test if you are honest about your decision.</p><p>Whether you side with Catherine or Katherine, each side of the morality meter results in 3 separate endings.  If you answer everything correctly you get the True ending.  If you fuck up, you get the "Good" ending.  If you fuck everything up, you get the Bad ending.</p><p>I feel rather good about myself that I passed these questions perfectly and was rewarded with the <b>True Katherine Ending</b>.  Though, this is really only by the director's standards.  Given how much Vincent continued to completely fuck up, and his inability to fix anything on his own, I feel like I won the Special Olympics.  If he talked about his problems, this would have been over long ago.</p><p>The other two endings are from not choosing either girl, which is really how I personally live my life.  Katherine threw that baby shit at me, and it made me think about things differently.  It turns out she lied about it.  She was not pregnant.  It's not clear if she actually made all that up, but she is not with child.  And by the time, she revealed this, my answers were already aligned with her.  It didn't matter if the baby was real, because I was ready now.</p><p>Which is absolute bullshit.  The damn game tricked me into being someone else.  From the start I was planning on ditching both of them, but she made me care.  Ugh...</p><p>The ending I got felt fake.  And after watching all the endings on youtube, the <b>True Freedom</b> ending felt like the best one.  It ends with the following quote, <b>"Why would you live life without doing what you want?  That's just a recipe for misery."</b> That's what I do everyday.  I live life how I want to.  But I don't agree that this means a person has to stay single to do what they want.  You can do what you want in life with someone else as well.</p><p>Here's a list of all the endings, and how to get them: <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings" title="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings">http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings</a></p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Even though I thought a lot about this game was stupid, I think it accomplished its goal quite well.  It made me question my ideas about relationships, and think about things.  In the end, it's a totally different game than anything else out there, and has more much depth than most others too.</p><p><b>I would totally recommend this game.</b> At 15 hours, it's a perfect weekend game.  And I'm really interested to see how my friends would react in these situations, and what their outcome would be (provided they answer everything honestly).<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Child of Eden" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/child-of-eden">Child of Eden</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On a console that sees release after release of first person shooters in a war setting, or in a space setting, Child of Eden finds itself among a very different crowd.  It's about as opposite as you can get from all that.  It is a unique gaming experience that takes you on a journey of sights, sounds, and color.  Brilliant vibrant colors.</p><p>What Tetsuya Mizuguchi began with Rez in 2001/2002, he has continued with Child of Eden.  The visually stimulating and pulsing background bores its creatures.  On screen, you target these creatures and shapes with the crosshairs, lock on to them, and fire your weapons.  You also have smart bombs, that take care of all the enemies on the screen at once.  Child of Eden adds a third weapon: rapid fire.  Only rapid fire can take down incoming enemy fire, and some enemies are only vulnerable to rapid fire.</p><p>Both Rez and Child of Eden seem rather easy on the surface.  Point and Shoot, right?  It goes a little deeper than that.  In Rez, you start building up massive points if fire all your locked-on shots at once.  Child of Eden continues this scoring method, but adds in a little twist.  You need to fire your shots along with the beat in order to build up your multiplyer.  Rez did this automatically for you.  Once I figured this out, Child of Eden became a much more aesthetically pleasing game.  Music games always sound their best when you play them correctly.  :)</p><p>While this game is a beautiful work of art, I never really felt the same excitement and wonder I did when I first played Rez over 9 years ago.  Rez absolutey blew me away on that winter day in January 2002.  Each level had a unique feel.  It's music was raw, dynamic, and told a story of its own.  While Child of Eden's music has a few dynamic sequences, it feel mostly flat and generic.</p><p>Rez used tracks from established artists, and pulled together 6 songs that had variety and cohesion.  The music behind Child of Eden is a much different story, and barely mentioned anywhere.   It's really just an interactive visualization for the Genki Rockets.</p><div class='title'><b>Genki Rockets</b></div><p>The Genki Rockets is a group formed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi starring a fictional lead singer, Lumi, who is a hologram (much like Sharon Apple from Macross Plus).  It's known now that the lead singer is portrayed by Rachel Rhodes, but whatever.  Also in the group is music producer Kenji Tamai.  All other members are secret, apparently.</p><p>The group began in 2006 when Mizuguchi wrote the song "Heavenly Star", made a colorful video, and posted it to youtube.  It went viral, and became a huge success.</p><p>Like all other J-Pop groups who have fictional characters as band members, they have a detailed back story, and this is the same story that sets up Child of Eden.  Lumi is the first human born in space on September 11th, 2019 (NEVER FORGET).  She expresses her thoughts and feelings through songs, and sends them as messages to earth.</p><p>The Genki Rockets have a unique live performance involving the visual component as highly as the audio.  Since Lumi is in space, and has never been to earth, her appearance is projected on stage using hologram-like technology.  The wikipedia articles states the technology is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner">Musion Eyeliner</a>, which is basically just using a large LED screen that gives the appearance of projecting.</p><p>They really don't have that many songs.  "Heavenly Star" premiered in 2006, and was featured in Lumines II.  In 2007, the recorded a couple more singles, and in 2008, they recorded enough to release an album.  They really haven't done a whole lot up until now.  Here's their tracklist for Child of Eden:</p><p>Stage 1 - Matrix - <b>Fly!</b> (2008)<br/>Stage 2 - Evolution - <b>Star Line</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 3 - Beauty - <b>Breeze</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 4 - Passion - <b>Maker</b> (2011)<br/>Stage 5 - Journey - <b>Heavenly Star</b> (2006) &amp; <b>Flow</b> (2011)</p><p>Check out their website: <a href="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/" title="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/">Genki Rockets dot Com</a>.  They have a live streamed concert on Ustream happening on Tuesday!</p><div class='title'><b>Extended Story</b></div><p>Child of Eden expands on Lumi's story.  With her music, mankind is inspired to explore the vast reaches of outer space.  With their exploration, the Internet expands and grows.  The Internet can be accessed anywhere humans have reached.  And the Internet is renamed to Eden.  Eden is the fountain that which all knowledge flows.</p><p>In the 23rd century, humans rebuild Lumi's likeness and personality in Eden.  Project Lumi nears completion, but is compremised by a virus attack.  And this is where you come in.  Protect Lumi, and complete the project.</p><p>Incidentally, the story of Rez picks up after Lumi is completed.  Later on, Lumi becomes the central AI for Eden and controls the flow of information.  However, the information is vast, and the task becomes overwhelming.  Lumi shuts down, and exposes Eden to all manor of virus attacks.  In Rez, you explore from your local areas of Eden to the central mainframes.  You take down rouge programs and viruses, while rebooting Lumi and restoring order.</p><p>It's rather interesting how Child of Eden portrays the future Internet as a lush utopia of wonder and beauty.  While the future beyond that in Rez is dark and crippled.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Child of Eden seems like the ultimate goal of Mizuguchi's plan for the Genki Rockets.  I really wonder at what point did that plan began.  Unfortunately I'm not as familiar as I should be with his works.  I consider myself a fan, but I haven't played anything of his since Rez.</p><p>After leaving Sega in 2003, he formed Q? Entertainment, and they've made Meteos, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and Gunpey.  Lumines is their huge money maker, and it makes heavy use of music.  Is all that music licensed?  or is it all original tracks developed in house?  I should play that game.</p><p>I wonder if the Genki Rockets was just some weekend project.  He got some of his pals together, jammed, and wrote a song.  Then he started working on the video, and then posted it to see what some of his fans thought.  With its huge viral success, he probably just wanted to see how far he could take it.</p><p>Then again, the Genki Rockets had all their fame in 2006 to 2008.  They sat on the back burner for 3 years until now with Child of Eden.  And you barely see the name "Genki Rockets" anywhere.  Mizuguchi is just retconning Rez to be canon with his washed up JPop band.</p><p>I'd be real interested to know the actual story behind all of this.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to L.A.

| May 20, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Watchin' Faces, Solvin' Cases.</p><p>I got L.A.Noire in the mail last night, and couldn't help myself but play a few hours and introduce myself to Rockstar's newest title.</p><p>I went through all the "tutorial" missions, and completed my first full case. The tutorials were rather linear and localized. Once I got to the first case, the world really opened up, and the GTA nature of Rockstar games came to light. After completing the first case, the next case started immediately, which was somewhat dissapointing. It felt very linear, but maybe later on they'll give you a choice of different cases to follow and accomplish.</p><p>When solving a case, you most collect evidence from the crime scene, interview witnesses, and follow the clues. The clues will bring you to different locations in 1947 Los Angeles, and the case continues to unfold. The first case ended rather predictably, and there really wasn't much variation. Though, I'm sure that later cases will have multiple valid endings.</p><p>It's actually pretty fun. It's very much in the same vain of your Ace Attorney titles, except completely presented as an open world Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>I was somewhat bored with it last night, but the more and more I think about it this morning, the more and more I want to return to the world of Cole Phelps.<br/>____</p><p>It's pretty similar to Heavy Rain. You definitely do a lot of the same things in the same manor, such as interrogation and crime scene searching, but it doesn't feel the same. I'm not really sure why...</p><p>Crime scene searching is nearly identical. As you walk around, the controller will vibrate if there's a clue nearby. Your character picks it up, and can twist and twirl it around to look for specifics. If it's relevant, you make a note of it in your crime log. These clues can be used as evidence later on when interrogating people.</p><p>Interrogations involve a list of questions in your crime book. You ask a question, and the person gives a response. You have 3 options. You either believe them (truth), or doubt them, or call them a liar. I'm having trouble telling the difference between Doubt and Lie. But from what I can tell, you can call them a liar if you have definitive evidence their statement is false. You can doubt them if you think their statement is false, but have no real evidence to back it up.</p><p>What's hilarious is as your detective level goes up, you can use a "life-line" to help you choose truth/doubt/lie. Using a point will take a way an answer. You can also "phone a friend" by using points to see what the Rockstar Social Club recommends. :)</p><p>I guess it reminds me more of Phoenix Wright, rather than Heavy Rain because Heavy Rain felt more fluid and natural. Phoenix Wright and L.A.Noire have a very apparent game-y layer for the investigation and interrogation that does not suspend my disbelief. But you still do the same type of things in all 3 games.<br/>____</p><p>It's hard to not say this is some kind of a GTA clone, since it is open world and made by Rockstar.</p><p>While GTA is totally open world, and you can pretty much do anything at any time, L.A.Noire feels more restrictive. Between Case 1 and Case 2, there was no leisure time, or even an option to choose Case 2. In that manor, it feels less open, and far more mission oriented. I feel like I'm wasting time, when I'm driving off to stop a random street crime, search for hidden cars, or find historical landmarks. Also, since you're playing a cop, you don't really have much the full spectrum of morality choice. It's kinda like Mass Effect in that way, where you're either play Captain Picard or Dirty Hairy. You're still on the good side of the law. And you can't change that.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-ds-carrying-case-puppet">Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

And I've had one on preorder ever since they've announced the price and release date.  I wrote something a few weeks ago about how excited I was about it: <a href="/old/v7/nintendo-3ds" title="/nintendo-3ds">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=829</a>.  I wasn't excited for the 3D so much, as I was to finally have a second DS for trading of Pokemon.</p><p>This week, the gaming press have gotten their review units, and have written some reviews and comments about the handheld.  There have been 2 concerns that are starting to make me doubt whether I should purchase the Nintendo 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Battery Life</b></div><p>Apparently, if you're using the Nintendo 3DS under the lowest settings without any 3D, you can only get about 4 1/2 hours worth of game time out of it!  And then it takes about 3 1/2 hours to fully charge the thing.  This is ridiculous compared to my DS Lite, which I can play for hours and hours, and never think to charge it.</p><p>How is the Nintendo 3DS supposed to be a handheld if I'm always tethered to an electrical outlet?  How is this supposed to work if when I go to on a long vacation and want to play through Okamiden, or Zelda Spirit Tracks?  I'll be constantly charging the stupid thing.</p><p>Source from Ars Technica: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars" title="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars</a></p><div class='title'><b>DS Rendering</b></div><p>The 3DS screens have higher resolution as the DS.  As such, if you're playing a DS in full screen mode, the image is stretched and the pixels are not 1 to 1.  You can fix this by running DS games in their native resolution, but it is small.  Almost, Gameboy Micro small.  Also, according to the Destructoid article, the colors are slightly washed out.  DS games look much more brilliant on a DSi or a DSi XL.</p><p>This would really hamper my experience with the 3DS for the first several months as I will be using it to play DS games.  With the added processing power of the 3DS, you'd think they make the games look better, much like the Playstation 2 did with PS1 games.</p><p>Source from Destructoid: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml">http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml</a><br/>Also, Kotaku or Joystiq wrote the exact same thing a few weeks ago.</p><div class='title'><b>Buy or not Buy</b></div><p>So now, I'm a little torn.  It seems like if I get a 3DS, I will still be using my DS quite often.  I might only use the 3DS for 3DS games (of which none I care about), or the built in games (which are not full games, but little time wasters), or the eStore (which won't even be ready by launch).</p><p>Let's take a look at a timeline.</p><p>November 21st, 2004 - Nintendo DS<br/>June 11th, 2006 - Nintendo DS Lite<br/>April 5th, 2009 - Nintendo DSi<br/>March 29th, 2010 - Nintendo DSi XL</p><p>March 27th, 2010 - Nintendo 3DS</p><p>With the release of each recent handheld, they've had another one fixing problems not too long after.  With the original horrid ugly looking DS, they replaced that thing with the pretty DS Lite a year and a half later.  The DS Lite fixed all the design problems they had with the DS.  It improved battery life, full LCD screens, in a smaller, more compact design.  I did not own a DS until the DS Lite was released, and by then, there was an actual reason to own one.</p><p>Given the uproar about the current battery life of the Nintendo 3DS, I doubt it'll take long before they come up with the solution.  I should really wait for that solution rather than spending $250 on something that might end up sitting on my shelf for the months to come.</p><p>If anything, the release of the Nintendo 3DS should bring down the price of used DSs.  Maybe I'll pick up a DSi XL.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space Extraction + Severed" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space-extraction-severed">Dead Space Extraction + Severed</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 7, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dead Space Extraction</b></div><p>In 2009, the now Visceral Games produced a Dead Space spinoff named Extraction.  It was a Wii title, and it was an on-rails shooter.  What better direction for the series than to make this moody adventure game into a fast paced action game.  And then to release it on a platform that has the least amount of your fan base.  I'm not really sure why they thought this was a good idea.  And it seems they won't make that mistake again as it horribly tanked in sales.</p><p>Being a fan of Dead Space, I had eventual plans to buy it.  My local Wal*mart always has copies, and I would probably take the plunge once the price point hit $20.  But last year's E3 came with some amazing news.  With the upcoming release of the Playstation Move, Visceral was upscaling the graphics, and including the game FOR FREE with each initial copy of Dead Space 2!</p><p>And thank god it was free.  I finished it the other day, and $20 is still a bit much.  It's a decent on-rails shooter, but the name "Dead Space" brings in some very weighted expectations.  Dead Space is a very solitary experience.  It's a game that crawls into your head and exercises your ears.  Most enemies are taken on a few at a time, and using the environment can lend itself well to taking down swarms of them.</p><p>An on-rails shooter is the exact opposite of that.  Enemies pop up, and you shoot them down.  Hit the weak spot for massive damage.  Bang bang bang!  Also, now it's two player! No longer a solitary experience. And you're always running around in a group of two to five people.</p><p>I am glad I played though it, though.  Story-wise, Dead Space Extraction takes place directly before Dead Space 1.  You play several characters on the surface of Aegis VII (or whatever) when the outbreak occurs.  You find a couple of survivors, escape the surface of the planet to the Ishimura, and then eventually escape the Ishimura.  It sets up a couple things in Dead Space 1, and ends almost right as the next game begins.</p><p>It's fun to see some of the expanded universe of Dead Space, but I don't really find the story all that interesting.  Hurrah, there's a dangerous space object that turns people crazy and into monsters.  It's really just background setup for the game's senario.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 2 Severed</b></div><p>So anyway, most of your characters in Extraction survive past the end, but their stories aren't over.  Last week, Visceral released an $8 expansion for Dead Space 2 entitled Severed, which continues the tale of two characters from Extraction.  They both happen to be on Titan while Isaac is running around killing things.  You play soldier Gabe Weller, as he tries to make it to his Wife, Luxine.</p><p>Severed is actually pretty amazing.  It's tight and short story that brings together all the aspects I love about Dead Space.  As you're running through the mines, separate areas are distinct by the sounds of the loud, nearby machinery.  The environment actually uses your senses to spook you, rather than scare tactics.  And the story actually adds a little depth to the Dead Space universe.</p><p>It's definitely worth playing.</p><div class='title'><b>The Universe</b></div><p>Besides these games, EA has done a whole lot with the Dead Space IP.  There's a couple other games, plus a few movies and books too.  I haven't touched any of that crap.  But, given my investment into the series already, I might consider checking more of this stuff out.</p><p>Dead Space Ignition - PSN Title and prequel to Dead Space 2<br/>Dead Space Downfall - Animated film that takes place in between Extraction and Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Aftermath - Animated film that takes place after Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Comic Book - A Comic Book that takes place before Downfall<br/>Dead Space Martyr - A novel that focuses on the Unitology religion.<br/>Dead Space Salvage - A Comic book that takes place some time between Dead Space 1 and 2.</p><p>I think this shows how poor the story of Dead Space is. All of these spin-offs center around the events in the game itself.  The only real universe building they've done is that novel which centers on the Unitology religion that keep coming back to.  Everything else is basically "and then this happened!" rather than "and this is why it happened."<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo 3DS" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-3ds">Nintendo 3DS</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I have had mine preordered since Nintendo announced the price and release date, and I am super excited.  Not necessarily because of the 3D capabilties, nor any of the games, but mostly as a replacement for my Nintendo DS Lite.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo DS Lite</b></div><p>My Nintendo DS was part of the second release wave of the Nintendo DS Lite in Japan, almost 5 years ago.  I wasn't initially into the DS, mostly because of the aesentics.  It looked like a frampy piece of tech designed around the chipset inside.  There really weren't that many games for it either.</p><p>When they unveiled the sleak and sexy design of the DS Lite, it completely turned around my opinion.  By that time, there were games that were actually worth my time.  Tetris DS, Phoenix Wright, Electroplankton and Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow were the first games I owned for the handheld, and still remain as some of the best game offered for the platform.</p><p>Over the past 5 years, I have played my Nintendo DS so much that the touch screen can no longer be correctly configured.  Games like Trauma Center and Ouendan are unplayable.  It's time for an upgrade.</p><p>Last year, I planned on replacing my DS with one of those DSi XLs.  Unfortunately, Nintendo made an incredibly stupid PR move.  One week before the DSi XL were to be released in the states, they announced the Nintendo 3DS.  The successor to the DS platform.  I was all set to replace my DS with a $190 DSi XL, and they lost my money.  Upgrading to the new platform is a much more lucrative prospect.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo 3DS</b></div><p>And now we're just 26 days away!  While there really aren't any launch titles that interest me, there are several on the horizon I care about: Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D, Professor Layton v. Phoenix Wright, Megaman Legends 3 and the newly announced Super Mario title.  There's also plenty of DSi Ware games that I haven't had a chance to play having never owned a DSi.</p><p>But!  What really interests me are the built games and features of the 3DS.  You can capture 3D photos and film. There are augmented reality games to play.  There's a built in pedometer that unlock rewards.  And there's a thing called <b>Street Pass</b>.</p><p>The Street Pass is a communication sensor that will connect to any other 3DSs you may pass by throughout your day.  It will transfer your Mii to them, and their Mii to you.  Besides building a social gaming web of your daily life, you can use these Miis with two built-in games: a Puzzle game and a Quest game.  For the puzzle game, Each Mii you meet you can exchange jigsaw puzzle pieces, and form some random Nintendo images.  In the Quest game, each Mii will take on monsters in a dungeon until they're scared off.</p><p>Here's a video showing off the Street Pass stuff: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ</a>.</p><p>I would expect conventions and other massive nerd gatherings to be invaluable towards building a huge list of stranger's Miis.  PAX West this year should be fantastic. ^_^</p><p>Anyway, I'm excited.  Though, I'll mostly use the 3DS to play DS titles.  Namely Pokemon.  Now that I'll have two DSs, I can trade Pokemon back and forth between my games willy nilly, and not need to borrow a friend's.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 28, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dead Space 2 is a game of many emotions.  For me, it was a 3 stage process.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 1: Disappointment</b></div><p>Isaac awoke from his bed in a medical lab somewhere and was told to get running!  Oh my, I don't remember these contols being so disorienting.  If you break the display into 3 sections, Isaac is positioned right between the left and middle sections.  Initially, this forces me to think that pushing directly up on the joystick will make Issac turn to the left slightly.  So, I try to compensate by push up and right, which make him run forward to the right.  I compensate by pulling back left, but then he doesn't move as far left I was thinking.  ugh :(</p><p>Also, Isaac was in a straight jacket the whole time, so that might be why it was so disorienting.  After an hour of running around, I was getting rather frustrated, so I put it down and went to bed.  I picked it up the next day with my expectations realigned, and ready to continue the journey.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 2: Delightment</b></div><p>Once I had become one with the controls, Dead Space's wonderful concept of immerson took center stage.  I was no longer controlling Isaac, I WAS Isaac.  Dead Space 2 is right at home with everything I loved about the first game, namely the environment and the sound.</p><div class='title'><b>The Moon!</b></div><p>While going through offices, homes, and stores in this mess of a space station or space ship or whatever, people kept referring to it as "Titan".  I figured it was just the name of the place, until I entered a room with a complete view of the outside.  It was Saturn!  The planet Saturn!  It hung so beautifully in the spacey sky.  And I realized that by "Titan", they meant the MOON!</p><p>In Dead Space 1, they just made up some planet for the Ishimura to crack.  I think it was called Aegis?  Actually, seeing how Aegis is greek, there probably is a moon with that name in our Solar System, but no where near reknowned as Titan.</p><p>The Titan moon base continued with Dead Space's theme of an organic, yet synthetic environment, ala Alien Resurrection.  And it's horrific display of gore and twisted ideals, ala Event Horizon.  Unlike the Ishimura from the first game, the Titan moon base feels much more comfortable.  Much of the environment feels dank because all the lights have been blown out and there's blood everywhere.  Before all hell broke loose, I'm sure much the locations looked a lot like Star Trek, or Mass Effect.  They just needed a fresh coat of blood to tear them down.</p><p>Now that we're running through a sustainable ecosystem, rather than an engineering vessel, there is much more variety.  You find yourself going through residential units, a mall, a church, and an elementary school, before you get to the space station stuff.</p><p>Dead Space doesn't miss the opportunity to go creepy with the elementary school.  There are now baby necromorphs and 5th grader necromorphs.  I think the 5th graders are my favorite enemy in the game.  10 or 15 of them will appear from a doorway and attempt to swarm you, while keeping their distance.</p><p>Rather than shooting them down with my gun, I always go for melee. Â It reminds me a lot of this website: <a href="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/" title="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/">How many five years olds could you take in a fight?</a> The website is purely theoretical, and this was my "real life" chance to find out!  I was able to take down about 6 of 'em, before 3 more jumped on top of me and brought me down.  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp">Get these goddamn children off of me!</a></p><div class='title'><b>The Mood</b></div><p>Unfortunately with the amount of variety in the environment itself, sound took second place to art.  While the mood is as immersive as the first game, each area is distinct because of the environment itself, not because it sounds different.  Two of my favorite moments from Dead Space 1 were the engine room, and the first moment you hit space.</p><p>The engine room was massively loud.  The whirring of the engine completely over came my senses, and made progress a bit disorienting.  Even more so when the enemies broke into the room and I had to fight them while the huge, loud engine was right on top of me.  There is nothing like this in Dead Space 2.</p><p>The only parts in Dead Space 2 where the sound takes center stage is Space, which is completely the same as the first game.  There are several points when you are thrust into the vacuum of space to complete your task.  When this happens all sound is sucked out of the environment, and the only thing you hear is yourself.  The beeping on your oxygen tank, your breath as you exhale into your helmet, and the muddled clomps of your foot steps.</p><p>Astronauts describe the feeling of being in space as very isolating.  There is nothing between you and space, but the layer of your space suit.  Dead Space nailed this feeling perfectly, so I'm glad they brought it back for the sequel.  And now you have thrusters to fly through Space!</p><div class='title'><b>Mood Killer</b></div><p>One thing I really hate about Dead Space 2 is the use of scare tactics.  Dead Space 2 does an incredible job of immersing you in the environment and lulling you into an intent state, only to tear everything down by a monster popping out of the wall, or jumping out at you from behind a corner.  It doesn't make the game scary.  Being startled is not being scared. Â By the fourth or fifth time, I just shrug it off and blow them away. There's no sense of danger, or being spooked.</p><p>It's the difference between somewhere coming up from behind you and yelling "BOO", rather than walking through the woods at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 3: Frustration</b></div><p>It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt :(</p><p>Dead Space 2 is quite an enjoyable experience until you get to the final chapters of the game.  All story points converge at the government sector of the moon base.  You've lead all the enemies of the game to this point, so now you need to fight them all.  And you have a new enemy which cannot be killed, only slowed down.</p><p>Throughout the entire game, ammunition and health had never really been a problem.  I have died quite a bit, but it was usually because I did something stupid.  Dead Space would train me not to do that, and point out it should be done this way.  I adapted and continued.  I would always have enough health packs lying around to heal me, and plenty of ammo around to keep me moving through the hordes of enemies.</p><p>In the second to last chapter, Dead Space pretty much gave up on this balance.  The enemies were more difficult, and there were more of them.  I started using a whole lot of ammunition taking them down without enough to return to take on the next wave.  So, I started getting hit more, and using up my health packs.  Wave after wave of enemies continued, and I no longer had health to regen.</p><p>I basically pushed and shoved my way through all the enemies to make progress, which resulted in many many lives, and many many restarts.  Yes, I wasn't really thinking about how I could improve, but with constant failure, I just wanted to get it done.  I finally made it to the final checkout, which was complete with a Store to resupply.</p><p>What awaited behind that checkout was another constant horde of enemies, I had to push through to get to the final boss.  But when I made it, I was all out of ammo and health again.  Basically fucked.  I tried taking them down, but after 30 minutes, I quit.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>With a good night's rest to think about my options, I returned with a plan.  I sold all my extra ammo and focused completely on the only gun I had completely leveled up, my Plasma Cutter.  With my strategy realigned, I tore through the horde, pushing most of them aside to greet the final boss, again.  This time I blasted the shit of them.  They hardly stood a chance.</p><p>Overall, Dead Space 2 did not let me down.  I feel like it had a few incredible scenes and sequences, sewn together by a solid base.  Before I got to the end, I had a very enjoyable time, and I'll probably pick it up again to chew away at the remaining achievements.</p><p>I would totally recommend Dead Space 2 for anyone that has fond memories of the original.</p><p>Also, the legend continues (or begins) with Dead Space Extraction included on the disc!  Plus, there is DLC releasing tomorrow that ties Extraction into Dead Space 2, entitled "Severed".<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Road to Starcraft II Beta" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-road-to-starcraft-ii-beta">The Road to Starcraft II Beta</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This exchange process negatively impacts the World of Warcraft game environment by detracting from the value of the in-game economy."</em></p><p>Apparently my inactive character was trading gold on eBay?  While still being odd, this posed a great problem:  My Battle.net account is now closed.  I can't log in or do anything now. :/</p><p>The bottom of the email said that if I had any disputes, go to this page: <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=exploitfaq&amp;rhtml=true" title="http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=exploitfaq&amp;rhtml=true">http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?tag=exploitfaq</a>.</p><p>For the most part it says if I have not violated the terms of use, and have never given away my login information, contact the Support Team.  I went to the Support Team page, filled out their form, and wrote a description of my account closure.</p><div class='title'><b>April 14th</b></div><p>Two days go by and I receive another email from Blizzard stating that they have determined my account was <em>"accessed by someone not authorized to do so by the World of Warcraft Terms of Use"</em>.  Well, at least they no longer believe I was screwing around on my inactive account.  Unfortunately, my account is still closed and I must go through the process of reactiving it.</p><p>The email sends a link to a PDF on how to reactivate my account: <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf" title="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf">http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf</a></p><p>I need to fill out this form, sign it, and send it to Blizzard along with a photocopy of an official government form of ID.  Alternatively, I could scan my Driver's License and email it instead, but I don't have a scanner.</p><p>Since this sounded like a lot of work, I just left it as a problem for my future self to deal with.</p><div class='title'><b>April 22nd</b></div><p>About a week later, Blizzard started handing out Starcraft II Beta codes to anyone who preordered the game.  I got an email from Amazon in the morning with my very own Beta code!  Whoo!  I can play Starcraft II right now!  Oh wait...  Thanks to the laziness of my past self, my Battle.net account is still closed.</p><p>On the way home, I stopped at Kinkos and photocopied my Driver's License.  When I got home, I filled out the form, packed everything into an envelope and shipped it off to Blizzard.</p><div class='title'><b>April 30th</b></div><p>Yet another week later, I received an email from Blizzard saying my account has been reactivated and my password has been reset!  I was out of town that weekend, so I was reading the email on my phone.</p><p>When I got back to my apartment, I powered up my computer and clicked the reactivation link in the email, but it had expired.  I tried reseting my password on Battle.net, but I wouldn't receive another reactivation email.  I tried a couple times, and each time it said it would send an email and follow the link inside.  I would receive nothing.</p><p>So, I waited.  Maybe it's backed up, and I'd receive those emails over night?  The next day, I received nothing.  Nor the following day.</p><div class='title'><b>May 5th</b></div><p>On Wednesday, I decided to try again.  Why not?  Oh hey, it worked this time.  I got the email.  I followed the link.  And my Battle.net account has been fully reactivated!  huzzah.  I entered my Beta code, and Starcraft II Beta appeared in my games list.  Battle.net gives you a tiny 2.6 mb file, which downloads the full installer for Starcraft II which is about 1.46 gigs.</p><p>My computer does not like the way Blizzard downloads files to my computer.  The Downloader would run for about 10 or 20 minutes and crash my computer with the Blue Hardware Failure Screen.  It would boot up just fine, start downloading, and in another 10 or 20 minutes, BAM, blue screen.</p><p>This happened for about 3 hours until my computer finally finished downloading the whole thing.  After all the hiccups, the installer ran perfectly fine, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Patching</b></div><p>I immediately ran Starcraft II, but...  there's a flood of patches that I need to download and install.  And I need to download and install each individual patch.  Which is absurd.</p><p>First off, I just finished downloading the full installer from your servers.  Why wasn't the application I installed on my computer fully patched to begin with?  You already control the file I just downloaded.  I wasn't installing this from a CD or an old installer I downloaded months ago.  I JUST downloaded the file.  Any download service such as PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, etc already does this.</p><p>Secondly, Why do I need to download each individual patch at a time?  Why aren't all these patches condensed into a single update?  Again, every single modern download service already does this.  Why doesn't Blizzard?</p><p>I don't get it...</p><p>Also, my computer hates these patches just as much as the initial installer, so my computer downloads half a patch and crashes.</p><div class='title'><b>Finally</b></div><p>One month of pain, and Starcraft II is finally running on my machine.  Upon startup it auto-detecting the graphical capabilities of my machine and set everything to the lowest settings. ^_^</p><p>It runs quite well though.  I'm actually surprised how well it runs after all the headaches of getting the thing setup.  The music studders a little bit, but that's about it for bugs.</p><p>There's not much to say about the game itself other than "yes, it's Starcraft."  It's a smoother, graphically updated version of the game with a couple new additions.  The graphics are pretty.  The music is catchy.</p><p>I absolutely suck at this game, but if you want to battle me feel free to add me as a friend.  ^_^  I like that they have 2 friend lists in the game.  One for Battle.net accounts and one for player accounts.  I can easily split those between people I know in real life (aka Friends), and other players I meet in the game.</p><p>So, If I know you in real life, just search for my Battle.net account using my main email address.  Otherwise, my player account is DyreSchlock.DyreSchlock.  I might change that to Schlock.Dyre to remove the redundancy.</p><div class='title'><b>Battle.net Account</b></div><p>I still have no actual idea why my Battle.net was closed.  Maybe they searched eBay for users with the same name?  I dunno...</p><p>I bought one of these things though:  <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822" title="http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822">The Battle.net Authenticator</a>, which is just an RSA key fob.  I wanted to buy one of these anyways, but I was waiting for a Starcraft II design.  I bought one immediately though, since I don't really want to go through the process of reactiviting my account again.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Starcraft II Collector's Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/starcraft-ii-collectors-edition">Starcraft II Collector's Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
Posted in

| April 8, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This morning Blizzard announced its pricing and release details for Starcraft II.  One would say Starcraft II its Blizzard's most anticipated game of ALL TIME, given the success and timeless qualities of Starcraft I.  Blizzard announced the regular retail version at $60, and the Collector's Edition at $100.  Here's a news article from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-announces-starcraft-ii-collector-s-edition-170358.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/blizzard-announces-starcraft-ii-collector-s-edition-170358.phtml">Destructoid</a>.  Included in the Collector's Edition is an artbook, a comic, a WOW pet, some exclusive profiles for Starcraft II and a fancy USB stick with Starcraft I and its expansion.</p><p>Alone, I think the Collector's Edition is well worth the $100, especially since I no longer have my copy of Starcraft I.  But, given the history of Blizzard's Collector Editions, I would expect this one to sky rocket in value.  OK, so the Burning Crusade Collector's Edition isn't so hot, but sealed copies of the original World of Warcraft Collector's Edition go for over $1000 on ebay.  (<a href="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition+new&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_odkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition&amp;_osacat=0&amp;bkBtn=" title="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?_nkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition+new&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_trksid=p3286.m270.l1313&amp;LH_Complete=1&amp;_odkw=world+of+warcraft+collector+edition&amp;_osacat=0&amp;bkBtn=">source</a>)</p><p>In addition, people have been selling Beta Keys for Starcraft II on ebay for anywhere between $100 and $200. (<a href="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=starcraft%20ii%20beta&amp;_fln=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m283&amp;_rdc=1" title="http://completed.shop.ebay.com/i.html?LH_Complete=1&amp;_nkw=starcraft%20ii%20beta&amp;_fln=1&amp;_trksid=p3286.c0.m283&amp;_rdc=1">source</a>)  $200 for a game that you can only for another couple of months!</p><p>Collecting for the purpose of selling is always a gamble, but I bet you could easily sell a sealed copy of Starcraft II Collector's Edition for twice its value after the release of the game.  If you bought two, the game would pay for itself!  The Collector's Edition is up on amazon now (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starcraft-II-Wings-Liberty-Collector-2019s-Pc/dp/B002I0JMB8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1270749861&amp;sr=8-6" title="http://www.amazon.com/Starcraft-II-Wings-Liberty-Collector-2019s-Pc/dp/B002I0JMB8/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;s=software&amp;qid=1270749861&amp;sr=8-6">link</a>).  I pre-ordered a single copy for myself, but I'm terribly tempted to buy a second.</p><p>Anyways, those are my evil thoughts on the subject.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews/6">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/game-reviews/4">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (38)
