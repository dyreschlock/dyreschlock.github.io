We came across the <b>Highbridge Hills Sports Complex</b> (<a href="http://www.highbridgehillssc.com/pages/CourseMaps/" title="http://www.highbridgehillssc.com/pages/CourseMaps/">link</a>), which offered 7 courses in a single area.  One of which, Blueberry Hill, happens to be the highest rated disc golf course in Wisconsin.</p><p>So, this weekend, we packed up some camping gear, hopped in the car, and traveled high up north to check it out.  We stayed at <b>Copper Falls State Park</b>, which also comes very highly rated.  It's one of the top state parks in Wisconsin, and features tons of hiking, some waterfalls, and interesting wildlife.</p><div class='title'><b>Copper Falls</b></div><p>The first night, we were constantly woken up by these crazy howling sounds, which belonged to several <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fppKGJD3Y6c" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fppKGJD3Y6c">Barred Owls</a> yelling at each other over territory, or something.Â  After breakfast, we took to the trails that showcased the prominent waterfalls in the area: The Copper Falls, and the Brownstone Falls, both named after the color of rock underneath and surrounding them.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7718_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7718_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7718_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7718_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7718_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7729_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7729_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7729_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7729_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7729_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7745_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7745_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7745_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7745_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7745_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7785_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7785_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7785_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7785_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7785_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7836.webp"  /></p><p>The trails circle around the Bad River as it cuts through ancient volcanic rock, and formed a large gorge with rapids and waterfalls.

The "club house" was just a shack at the top of the hill, with two older guys just hanging out talking about disc golf stuff over and over again.  Blueberry Hill was rather unkempt.  Much of the course was overgrown, and started choking out the fair way.  Much of the ground was uneven, and easy to trip on.  And it was usually a game to figure out where the baskets of each holes were.</p><p>For us, many of the holes were incredibly long.  This course would probably test real professionals of the sport, but we're quite amateur.  We play incredibly casually and don't have keep track of the score.  Dave is the only one of us who can actually catch some distance on his drives, and he was still getting 4s and 5s on these (long) par 3s.</p><p>Also, the course was soaking wet from the rain or dew from the previous night, so feet were drenched by the time we finished.  We decided to head up to Ashland, and venture around rather than play anymore.  Then we drank for the rest of the night, and pretty much went home in the morning.</p><p>Camping was totally the highlight of the trip for me. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110924_camping/IMG_7908.webp"  /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Tiesto @ Aliant Energy Center" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/tiesto-aliant-energy-center">Tiesto @ Aliant Energy Center</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 19, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For his "College Invasion" Fall tour, larger than life, trance superstar DJ Tiesto, made Madison, WI one of his stops.  What?  It's kinda odd thinking about Tiesto performing in Madison.</p><p>Though, given how the scene has been exploding around here, and local bookers have been getting some serious talent to come to our town, AND how this is a college tour and Madison is one of top 10 schools in the country, I guess it makes sense.  This is a DJ concert anyway.  He's not playing in some fancy douche bag club.</p><p>Tickets were a mere $37, which is cheap compared to almost any gig in the last 5 years.Â  Also, he took the trouble to come to my town.Â  He's bringing the show to me!Â  I can walk to the damn concert.Â  So, I decided to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Merchandising</b></div><p>To prove just how big a sellout he is, upon entering the lobby of the Alliant Energy Center, I'm greeted with several booths selling and advertising shit.</p><p>There's Tiesto's merchandise booth with a whole lot of overpriced T-Shirts, and other crap.  There's a photo booth!  You can get your picture standing next to a picture background of Tiesto!  Hot Damn!  There was a booth that had the Playstation Move setup showing off some game.  There was a booth with energy drinks.  And another for Axe Body spray.</p><p>I think the bigger offense was during Porter Robinson's opening set.  The huge LED display behind would switch to ads! Which advertised the merchandise booth out in the lobby.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7364.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7361.webp"  /></p><p>People love rockin' out to T-Shirts!</p><div class='title'><b>Porter Robinson</b></div><p>Opening for Tiesto was Porter Robinson.  I got there around 8:30pm, so I caught the last half hour of his set before Tiesto began at 9pm.  As I entered, he was jammin to a remix of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuC2MUmQaG4">Deadmau5 - Raise your Weapon</a> that sounded like Madeon's fantastic remix.  It was much longer, and the extended parts didn't sound like it at all, so maybe it was a mashup, or something.</p><p>He set was pretty cookie cutter.  He played songs similar to what I've heard the locals spin around here.  He threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOuxTQpxawc">Wolfgang Gartner - Illmerica</a> towards the end, which felt like he was going for the popular vote, rather than building his own sound.  (At least, I think it was Illmerica.  It was some well known Wolfgang song.)</p><p>But whatever, I only caught the last half hour.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7356.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7360.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Tiesto</b></div><p>Man, I got there at the perfect time.  I didn't have to stand through any of the openers at all.  30 minutes after I arrived, Tiesto took the stage and started up his set.</p><p>I got the recorded the first 70 minutes of this (plus a few other clips), so take a look for yourself.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3DEB9BC4C66F8627</a></p><p>He starts off which a self indulging intro.  It's probably the club life theme song.  After he throws in a sample of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYIAfiVGluk">Imogen Heap - Hide &amp; Seek</a> (I thought it was BT at first), and starts hopping from trance anthem to trance anthem, and eventually goes into more Big Room (or whatever) House.  He pretty much kept with the Housey trend throughout the rest of the set, though some songs still kept a trancey vibe.  It's the kind of sound that he's known for these days.</p><p>He DID throw in a few classic tracks, which was a pleasant surprise.  One of which was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcJJMk81ZSw">Delerium - Silence (Tiesto Remix)</a>.  Only it WASN'T the Tiesto Remix!  Arrgghh.  It was the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvCTs-fQtg4">W&amp;W + Jonas Stenberg Remix.</a> This song is evil.  It uses the exact same build up as the Tiesto mix, but then shits all over itself with a breaky climax, rather than the beautiful atmospheric sound of the original.  Fuck this song.</p><p>I caught a few other songs too, but I don't remember their names.

This is the exhibition hall in the Alliant Energy Center.  A huge room surrounded by concrete and steel.  And, as Zack reminds me, the same place were they have horse shows, and monster truck rallies.  It's the same basic layout as an airline hanger.</p><p>The accoustics are horrible.  The bass bounces off all the walls, and makes a thunderous sound that echos through the entire space.  It drowns out any actual noise from the bass itself.  It turns into this Boom-Boom-Boom.  So, every bass line is identical throughout the set.  You can hear this quite plainly in the video I took.</p><p>The rest of the levels were jacked up, so you COULD make out what the songs actually were.  But even that had echo in this huge concrete hall.  Certainly not as much echo as the bass, but it still blurred the songs a tad.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7411.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7422.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7424.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>A Good Time</b></div><p>While, I'm pretty down on Tiesto, and he is a total sellout and a bit of a hack, I had a great time.  But, with my expectations so damn low to begin with, there's no place to go but up!</p><p>The crowd was quite amazing, too.  I think that was the biggest surprise for me.  There were some college kids there, but they were mostly in the huge bit in front of the stage.  Hanging back in the comfortable section were the actual fans.  Tiesto fans maybe, but definitely Trance fans.  Clubbers from Chicago and Milwaukee, and a bunch of kids that just wanted to dance and have fun.  There weren't any huge assholes.</p><p>When Tiesto hit on his mark with the Trance hits, everyone in the crowd was dancing and cheering.  Everyone was totally in the moment with this concert.  People were actually paying attention!  Rather than typing on their phone, or yelling at each other, or trying to feel each other up.</p><p>I haven't seen a crowd this responsive in a while.  But maybe this could be because it was on a weekday rather than a weekend, and people weren't drinking the night away.  And most trance fans are older than the new crop of EDM fans who are into dubstep, electro house, and all that stuff.</p><p>I had fun :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7428.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110915_tiesto/IMG_7450.webp"  /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Music!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-music-2">Upcoming Music!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 12, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>SPOILERS!!</b></div><p>Catherine is about Vincent.  He's been in a long term relationship with Katherine (with a K) for about 3 years (i think?).  And one day, on April 1st, they are talking in a cafe, and Katherine makes a few passive aggressive mentions about their future.  Later on, at the neighborhood bar, Vincent is chatting up his friends, they take off, and he meets "the girl of his dreams," named Catherine (with a C).  She's the sexiest thing he's ever seen.  After a rough nightmare, he wakes up beside her.  They spent the night together, and now he has cheated on Katherine (with a K).</p><p>While the story makes it out to question your ideas of relationships and love, it really boils down to a morality meter.  Do you want to side with Katherine or with Catherine?  Do you want to pursue your long-term relationship and finally "settle" down, or is this random encounter your ticket out of this jail sentence?  The game poses a series of blunt questions, subtle responses to texts, and responses to other people in similar situations.  Each answer moves to the meter back and forth.</p><p>I should probably mention how I played the game.  I'm not currently in any relationship what-so-ever, and don't really care to be.  I've had love in the past, but I'm over it, and don't really care anymore.  My responses to the life questions posed by Catherine (the game) mirrored this in the beginning.  I was neutral.  I floated in the middle.</p><p>Unfortunately, the game threw a cruel twist at me that I decided to believe.  Katherine said she was pregnant.  That's when my alignment changed and I had to start thinking of kids.  While it's pretty awesome that I personally don't have any kids, given the opportunity of being thrust into fatherhood, I would embrace it.  Someday, I do want kids.</p><p>So from that point on my opinion changed, and my responses to the questions started moving more towards the "stick with your wife" angle.  I was still answering everything as honestly as I could.  I wasn't trying to "game" the system towards any specific ending.  I mean, while I don't really want to be in a relationship right now, if I were in a relationship, I would answer something differently.  And that was reflected in the game.</p><p>These questions are meant to guide you through the story to your ultimate ending, but the story is horribly linear.  Vincent doesn't stand up for himself AT ALL.  He continues to let everything spiral out of control around him with the idea that he has no control over the situation.</p><p>Despite my test responses telling Catherine to fuck off, Vincent continues to sleep with her throughout the week.  While actually talking with Catherine, Vincent doesn't say a god damn word.  The entire game is Vincent constantly thinking to himself about what he should do, rather than actually speaking with Catherine or Katherine.</p><p>How the hell is this guy in a long term relationship when they never see each other, or talk about anything?  Even when texting Katherine, your only choices are bullshit passive aggression.  It's either "I'm sorry" or "Don't worry about me."  You can't actually say anything, or talk about anything.  There's no way of coming clean immediately.  And you NEVER see each other either.  How is this a relationship in the first place?!  A relationship is not some one-sided dialogue.</p><p>Things continue to spiral out of control, and Vincent never does anything about them at all.  It's fucking stupid.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Equally stupid is the way you play the game.  The game takes place over 8 or 9 days.  Each night of the week, Vincent has a nightmare.  The large amount of the game is played during the nightmare, and it's an action puzzle game.  You move around blocks on the wall, and climb up to the tippy top.</p><p>In reality, all men unfaithful men are being subjected to these nightmares.  If you do not reach the top in your dreams, you fall.  And when you fall, you die in real life.  Throughout the course of the game, anyone who dies in the dream, shows up on the news the next day as a new victim of the "curse."</p><p>You can prevent some of these deaths from happening, too.  Vincent meets several other people in his nightmare.  Sharing techniques, and talking about the problems they're facing in real life will help them solve them, and they'll survive the nightmares.</p><p>Catherine (the game) plays off the nightmares as a metaphoric representation of the relationship stress Vincent is going through in his real life.  And it works really well in that context, but it's so divorced from the actual plot that I wish I could just skip it all.  Nothing I do during the climbing sequence has any reflection on the story or plot, so it's completely useless.  You could plug any other type of game during these sequences, and it wouldn't change anything.</p><p>When climbing up these walls, all I can think about is wanting to get back to the real world, tell off Catherine, talk with Katherine and fix everything.  I played the game on <b>Easy</b> difficulty so I could fly through these sequences as fast as possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Catherine has 8 endings overall.  Throughout the game, the morality meter is displayed and can guide you towards a specific goal.  You'll either side with Catherine or with Katherine.  You can side with yourself as well by staying in the middle.</p><p>Throughout the final challenge, you are given a series of questions that no longer test your morality, but your resolve to stand by those choices.  These are presented to you as every other question has throughout the game.  They aren't as blunt as saying, "are you sure?".  They are truly (trying) to test if you are honest about your decision.</p><p>Whether you side with Catherine or Katherine, each side of the morality meter results in 3 separate endings.  If you answer everything correctly you get the True ending.  If you fuck up, you get the "Good" ending.  If you fuck everything up, you get the Bad ending.</p><p>I feel rather good about myself that I passed these questions perfectly and was rewarded with the <b>True Katherine Ending</b>.  Though, this is really only by the director's standards.  Given how much Vincent continued to completely fuck up, and his inability to fix anything on his own, I feel like I won the Special Olympics.  If he talked about his problems, this would have been over long ago.</p><p>The other two endings are from not choosing either girl, which is really how I personally live my life.  Katherine threw that baby shit at me, and it made me think about things differently.  It turns out she lied about it.  She was not pregnant.  It's not clear if she actually made all that up, but she is not with child.  And by the time, she revealed this, my answers were already aligned with her.  It didn't matter if the baby was real, because I was ready now.</p><p>Which is absolute bullshit.  The damn game tricked me into being someone else.  From the start I was planning on ditching both of them, but she made me care.  Ugh...</p><p>The ending I got felt fake.  And after watching all the endings on youtube, the <b>True Freedom</b> ending felt like the best one.  It ends with the following quote, <b>"Why would you live life without doing what you want?  That's just a recipe for misery."</b> That's what I do everyday.  I live life how I want to.  But I don't agree that this means a person has to stay single to do what they want.  You can do what you want in life with someone else as well.</p><p>Here's a list of all the endings, and how to get them: <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings" title="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings">http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings</a></p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Even though I thought a lot about this game was stupid, I think it accomplished its goal quite well.  It made me question my ideas about relationships, and think about things.  In the end, it's a totally different game than anything else out there, and has more much depth than most others too.</p><p><b>I would totally recommend this game.</b> At 15 hours, it's a perfect weekend game.  And I'm really interested to see how my friends would react in these situations, and what their outcome would be (provided they answer everything honestly).</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Okonomiyaki Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/okonomiyaki-recipe">Okonomiyaki Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 10, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>I am a huge fan of Japanese food and cooking.  And while my number one favorite Japanese food is Ramen, my secret favorite is Okonomiyaki (tied with Onigiri).  Okonomiyaki is absolutely delicious, and you'd think that there would be a restaurant somewhere, anywhere in the US that would actually serve this stuff, but you can't find it at all.</p><p>It's not really that hard to make either.  Most Okonomiyaki restaurants in Osaka and Tokyo basically let you make these things yourself.  They'll mix everything in the back, bring it out to you, and give you the opportunity to fire 'em up.   The steps are quite easy.  Dump everything on the grill into a pancake, steam/fry it for 5 minutes, flip it, steam/fry it for another 5 minutes, and you're done.</p><p>Not all Okonomiyaki is made the same, though.  I've been to a few other restaurants that have their own set of instructions.  In Nagasaki, just down the road from Chitosepia, there's an Okonomiyaki vendor that builds the pancake first, then piles on all the cabbage, then all the other ingredients.  In Kumamoto, Dave and I visited a restaurant that had Choboiyaki, the regional version of Okonomiyaki.  They followed similar instructions to the Nagasaki version, except it was twice as large, and folded over in a burrito fashion.  The burrito was sliced up, and you ate those pieces.  Here's the blog post: <a href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-ddr-edition" title="/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=884</a></p><p>I didn't want to do anything that complicated with my own rendition.  I don't even have a flat surface to fry these on anyway.  I'm using a wok.  For my recipe, I started using the instructions from here: <a href="http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html" title="http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html">http://okonomiyakiworld.com/best-okonomiyaki-recipe.html</a></p><div class='title'><b>Ingredients</b></div><p class='img'>All you need is the following: Okonomiyaki Mix, Water, Eggs, Cabbage, Green Onion, Bacon, Okonomiyaki Sauce, Japanese (or Kewpie) Mayonnaise.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7239.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><b>Equipment</b><br/><br/>You'll need a measuring cup to measure the flour and water, and you'll need a mixing bowl to mix everything in, along with a whisk to do the mixing.  You'll need a knife and a cutting board to chop up the cabbage and green onion.  You'll need a pan with a cover to fry and steam/fry everything in.  And you'll need a spatula to flip the pancake.  You'll also need a plate to eat it off of.<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7343.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><b>Step 1. Mix Mix Mix</b><br/><br/>Take 1 cup of Okonomiyaki Mix, and place it in the mixing bowl.  Add 2/3 cup of Water.  Mix everything completely.  Add 2 Eggs.  Mix everything completely.  Add a bunch of cabbage.  The original recipe says 6 cups of Cabbage, but it's pretty easy to tell if you need more or less.  Just keep mixing everything together until all the Cabbage is covered.  If you have an amount of mixture left that hasn't covered cabbage.  Add more Cabbage.  Chop up (or mince?) 2 stalks of Green Onion.  Mix everything completely.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7240.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7240.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7240.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7241.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7241.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7242.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7242.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7242.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><b>Step 2. Pancake</b><br/><br/>With everything mixed completely, it's time to fry the sucker.  Flip on a stove top to medium heat, and add some oil in your pan.  Let it heat up.  Take <b>HALF</b> of your mixture and plop it right on top of the oil.  Smash it down into the pan and squish all the cabbage.  Try and flattened it out a little bit, but make sure to keep it as a circle.  When satisfied, take 3 strips of Bacon.  Cut them in half.  And cover the surface area of the pancake.

I had Fishy and Chaos over to give it a try, and they liked it quite a bit. :)  Though, what really brings out the nostalgia and flavor of the Okonomiyaki is the sauce and the mayonnaise.  Underneath, the cabbage and mix seemed...  pretty regular.  Very safe, and normal.</p><p>Today is Saturday, and to fix the problem of the boring Okonomiyaki, I went to the farmer's market to find some delicious vegetables and food in hopes to shake things up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7261_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7293_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7330.webp"  /></p><p class='img'>I picked up some Shiitake Mushrooms, a Red Pepper, a Purple Pepper, some Okra, some Garlic, some Onions, and Edemame.  I also bought a bottle of dark honey.  It's amazing what you can get for a mere $10 these days.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7332.webp"  /></p><p class='img'>For my next attempt, I mixed in 2 mushrooms, half a red pepper, and half an onion, along with the cabbage and green onion.

I think dividing the mixture into thirds would have worked out much better than halves, but it was much better than my first attempt.  The mushrooms, pepper, and onion contributed so much to the overall texture of the pancake.  It was quite good.</p><div class='title'><b>Salmon!</b></div><p class='img'>A couple of weeks ago, I bought some Smoked Salmon from the Public Market in Seattle, and figured it would be the perfect ingredient for Okonomiyaki.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7350.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7344.webp"  /></p><p>I read a little tip online on how to introduce Salmon into the mix, and it worked out pretty well.  The following steps details what I did.  Start doing these steps just after Step 1 at the top.  Also, for veggies I used 3 stalks Green Onion, 1/2 White Onion, and 1/2 Red Pepper.</p><p class='img'><b>1. Cook the Salmon.</b> I think it's always a good rule of thumb to cook the meat before adding it to anything you may consume.  I basically crumbled and mashed it all up in the pan though.  I basically turned the salmon into fish flakes.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7346.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><b>2. Use 2/3 in the mix.</b> Take 2/3 of the salmon you've cooked and mix it in with everything else.  Leave 1/3 of the salmon in the pan.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7348.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><b>3. Pancake!</b> Put your pancake mix over the 1/3 salmon remaining in the pan so you have a layer of salmon on the bottom, and a layer of bacon on the top.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7349.webp"  /></p><p class='img'>Oh my god, this turned out the best of the 3.  The salmon flakes on the bottom gave a delicious earthy texture, and the salmon internally gave a much more robust flavor to the entire meal.<br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7354.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7354.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7354.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110910_okonomiyaki/IMG_7355.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Results!</b></div><p>Okonomiyaki is pretty easy to make once you purchase the flour, the sauce and the mayonnaise.

DJ Solo opened the Red Bull stage, but the next act I cared to see was Little Dragon at 5:30.  So, Five and I took the train and headed downtown for the afternoon.</p><p>We finally go the chance to visit Wow Bao, an Asian fast food place that Five had wanted to go to for a very long time.  We had some lunch, and took a tour of Grant Park and Millenium Park.  We took pictures of the bean and the fountain.  After that, we headed to Rotofugi to take a look at some art and toys.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I love this shot.Â  Mostly because the panoramic assembler magically cropped out that girl's boyfriend.

It's unfortunate that I didn't take enough photos to cover the problems that ICE had putting them all together, but it still looks magnificent.

I made it just in time to catch <b>Little Dragon</b> begin their live set on the main stage.  And they were nothing that I thought they would be.  I was in the mood to dance and hop around, and these guys were some indie hippie electronica band.  Not what I wanted...</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7037_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I took some pictures, grabbed some food, and waited for ATB to perform on the Red Bull stage.</p><div class='title'><b>ATB</b></div><p>I think everyone had the same idea because when <b>ATB</b> climbed on stage, the surrounding crowd grew immensely.  And everyone threw their hands in the air, and hopped up and down, which created a massive dirt cloud.  Yesterday, the rain and the crowd had turned the park into a mud pit, and today all that mud had dried into dirt.  And now that dirt is in the air, along with all the horrible cigarette smoke.  At least it's 70 today, instead of 90.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>ATB's set was pretty vanilla for him.  It was nearly identical to his set from early 2010 in Minneapolis.  He opened with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao">ATB - Ecstasy</a>, and followed up with boring trance, all the while sampling (teasing) his classic track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4">ATB - 9pm (Till I Come)</a>, which he never fully played.</p><p>ATB is the king of mediocre trance.  There's no way he could follow Andy Moor from last night.  And you could tell he had to fall back on pandering to the crowd when he played the Woo Hoo song (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk">Blur - Song 2</a>).  Really?!</p><p>I find it rather odd that ATB is the only representation of Trance at North Coast, and he's not even that good.  They couldn't find anyone from Armada or Anjuna that wasn't busy this weekend to play some decent trance?  They had Paul van Dyk last year for gods sake...</p><div class='title'><b>Benny Bennasi</b></div><p>ATB finished his horrid set, and left the stage to <b>Benny Bennasi</b>.  His sound was very raw and energetic.  He primary sticks to Electro House, but his sound is very Club House or Big Room or whatever you call it.  Unlike horrible hacks like David Guetta, he kept to a cohesive beat, which makes it actually danceable.  It fits the festival perfectly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>But I think the weekend had started to takes its toll on me.  After a fantastic Day 1 and 2, with nothing really going on for Day 3, and horrible ATB, I wasn't feeling the vibe at all.  I wanted something that actually spoke to me and set itself apart.</p><p>I stuck around for almost his whole set before wandering around the fest grounds again.  I should have left earlier so I could've caught <b>Of Montreal</b>, but oh well.  I didn't feel like staying for Bassnectar or Thievery Corporation, so I left to find some more delicious Chicago pizza at Gino's East.</p><p>I returned to Union Park just in time to hear the closing sounds of <b>Bassnectar</b> on the main stage, but I was outside of the park at the time.  I was waiting in line for tonight's after party at Transit.</p><div class='title'><b>Steve Bug &amp; Ida Engberg @ Transit</b></div><p>I've been to most clubs in Chicago, but I had never been to Transit before.  It had a very different floor plan than all the places I'm used to.  The only club that I could compare it to is Trinity in Seattle.  It had 3 completely separate rooms stacked with some major underground talent.</p><p>Kate Simko, DJ Heather, and rave-legend Woodie McBride ran things in the red room off to the side.  While a few other Chicago DJs opened for Minneapolis legends Jack Trash and Tyler Hampton in the loft room off to the other side.</p><p>The main room was in the center of the club.  The DJ booth was off to the side, and played itself off as an unimportant decoration.  The real focus was the circular dance floor in the center of the room.  It was aligned with VIP seating, speaker towers, sub woofers, and ceiling speakers.  Once you entered the circle, the sound was immense.  There were very few places you could escape the full wrath of sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp"  /></p><p>This night was incredibly nostalgic for me.  The openers in the main room played the type of House music that I grew up hearing in Minneapolis events.  It felt like all the non-Trance DJs in Minneapolis knew everything there was about House and nothing else.  At the time, I really wasn't into it.  The beat just kept going and going and going.  It changed when tracks changed, but it never really evolved into something else.</p><p>Though, when <b>Steve Bug</b> took over the decks that classic House sound definitely evolved.  It moved from repetition to something more layered and spacey, but kept the classic nature.  He blew those openers out of the fucking water.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp"  /></p><p>He is different, and hard to describe.  It like someone switched off the "suck" in the club, and made it awesome.  Those openers weren't in the same league as this guy.  Not even close.  He pounded the club with some jagged smooth beats.  It was definitely a surprise.</p><p>The crowd didn't really seem to notice for some reason.  It was really a somber night for the kids in Transit.  Most of the club was dancing and hanging out, but no one was really whipping them into shape.  The club's layout really didn't put an importance on the DJ, so maybe it was better to create a vibe to enjoy, rather than pander to the crowd and make them pay attention.</p><p>I have a feeling that Steve Bug was holding back just a little bit.  He created an amazing atmosphere, but he wasn't tearing down the place.  I think he left that for <b>Ida Engberg</b>, because the crowd totally changed when she took over.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp"  /></p><p>She finally showed up around 2am, and started off a track or two that built off of Steve Bug's atmosphere.  It was electric and energetic.  The crowd started hopping up and down, and cheering her on.  So she reciprocated by bringing the thunder.</p><p>The rest of her set tore the place down and everyone went nuts.  Everyone in the whole club was on the dance floor, and completely ignored the DJs in the other rooms.  I didn't even realize there were this many people in the club.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp"  /></p><p>I rocked out to her set for about an hour.  I left around 3am, as it had been a long exhausting (amazing) weekend, and I had 150 miles to drive in front of me.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>This had been one of the best weekends out of the year for me.  It's really hard for me to choose between heading to Seattle, visiting Ace &amp; Jess, and attending PAX, versus heading down to Chicago for North Coast.  Both are the best weekends, and I'm really glad PAX was held one week earlier this year.  Last year, I did half North Coast and half PAX and I feel my overall experiences of both were lessened.  This year, I attended the full breadth of both and they really can't compete with each other.</p><p>As mentioned, James Zabiela and Carl Cox were total stand outs for me, along with Ida Engberg and Steve Bug following them up.  I hope that next year, North Coast is able to bring the amount of variety and quality they had this year.  Also, I hope they fucking bring more than ATB to represent trance, ugh...</p><p>In terms of numbers, I read that they were able to get 50,000 people into Union Park this year, which is 10,000 more than last year.  They should have plenty of cash to make next year even bigger.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival - Day 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">North Coast Music Festival - Day 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Housey with some Electro.  An amazing beat with ripe sound.  A perfect build up to Zeds Dead, who performed next.</p><p>I'm not a fan of dubstep at all, but there is some I like, and <b>Zeds Dead</b> fall into that category.  They don't stick with the cookie cutter warble waaahhh.  They iterate on that, and keep a coherent beat.  It's actually danceable!  Maybe that's because they mix in a fair amount of Electro House behind their songs, along with some Drum &amp; Bass.  They threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg">Skrillex - Reptile Theme</a> near the end of their set.

These guys are a live electronica band.  They play drums and saxophone over a pre-recorded beat, and have a very unique sound.  Some songs are dubsteppy, and others are more dancey.  It's a very 80s/90s feel.  I like it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Next up, I went over to the Groupon Stage for <b>Future Rock</b>.  These guys are also a live.  They play synths, guitar and drums.  Their sound is very retro, but they follow a very modern dancey beat.  Very spacey and energetic.  Great Stuff.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Here's some video of Future Rock : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0</a></p><p>They finished up around 6:30, so I started looking for some food.  The festival grounds are lined with several food tents from local restaurants and bars.  I had some egg rolls, and fish and chips.  Delicious and fatty fried foods.  Perfect for filling the stomach.</p><div class='title'><b>Carl Cox</b></div><p>Carl Cox was pretty damn awesome. :). You don't really hear his name much these days, but he's been around since the beginning.  Along with Paul Oakenfold, Sasha and John Digweed.  They built the English dance scene in the 90s.  This is my second time seeing him and it's been almost 10 years.  The first time was for his Global CD tour in 2002.</p><p>It's interesting to see how he's evolved.  He was pretty much straight House back in the day, which is all I heard from the clubs.  As people ages and tastes changed, the pure House sound has become somewhat niche, and I never hear of it anymore.  It seems that Carl Cox has evolved passed that and has become a renaissance man.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>His set tonight was genre breaking.  While his set was penned in an overall Housey tone, he threw in some Techno and Trance to bring everyone up to speed with the best that is out there.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA">Maxime Dangles - Dhiaiz</a>!!  While it was all over the place, it was cohesive.  It made sense, and worked well.  It was fantastic. :)</p><p>I captured the whole set on video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1</a></p><p>While James Zabiela rocked my world yesterday, Carl Cox surprised and delighted me.  <b>These 2 guys are the clear highlight of North Coast for me.</b> I almost regret not going to his after party at The Mid.  But his was one of the first to sell out, so that club will be a crowded mess.  And it's usually that way on regular nights, so I think I'm better off heading off to Vision for Andy Moor.</p><div class='title'><b>Fatboy Slim &amp; STS9</b></div><p>Ending the night at the festival was <b>Fatboy Slim</b> headlining.  Unfortunately, he didn't really do anything for me.  Carl Cox completely blew me away, and anything else that followed needed to go further.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have not followed Fatboy Slim's music what so ever.  I know Star 69, but that's about it.  I can't really groove to his sound.  I listened to his promo mix for the Big Beach Festival in Tokyo earlier his year, and it didn't really speak to me, so I figured this performance would end up the same way.</p><p>It was really more of a concert anyway, rather than a DJ set, or even a festival DJ set at that.  But that crowd went absolutely nuts, and that's awesome.  It's good to see a legend of electronic music get the respect he deserves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp"  /></p><p>I took off a little early and listened to <b>STS9</b> for a little while, but they didn't really grab me either.  Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>Andy Moor @ Vision</b></div><p>Five was able to join me for Saturday night.  He missed his chance to get cheap tickets for North Coast.  But Andy Moor for $10?  Hell yeah.</p><p>For the first time, We took the train into town rather than spend $20 or $30 on parking.  SO MUCH CHEAPER.  $2.75 train in town, $15 cab back to the car.  If we planned it better, we could've taken the train back.  This is my plan next time.</p><p>Anyway, we arrived at Vision around to some lack luster trance openers.  They played a few popular anthems, but kept the vibe in control and ready for The main act.</p><p>Andy Moor took the stage around 2am, I think.  He started off quite solid.  I didn't recognize many of the tracks, but it was a solid vibe.  He kept the energy up, and never fell into that stereotypical trance pattern.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp"  /></p><p>About an hour in, things began to change.  It was at the point he dropped <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEa5C3P_GIY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEa5C3P_GIY">Above &amp; Beyond - Sun &amp; Moon</a>.  While it's not really my favorite song, it is the type of song that EVERYONE knows.  The entire crowd erupted in song and dance.  The track that followed set the tone for the rest of the night.  Raw and powerful.  I should have recorded it, so I could ID it later.  It rocked my world.</p><p>For the next two hours, he pulled out some mighty bangers.  I'm usually more a fan of uplifting, melodic trance, but this was special.  Five was on the dancefloor almost the whole night, makin new friends.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6903.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6903.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6903.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6932.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6932.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6932.webp"  /></p><p>We got back to his cousins place around 5:30, and promptly fell asleep.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival - Day 1" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-1">North Coast Music Festival - Day 1</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I was pretty sad that the crowd was so sparse, but those that were there were hanging on each break he threw down.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I took a bunch of pictures, but wasn't able to get video.  Afterward, I wandered around the festival grounds, looking at the vendors and their merchandise.  One of them had some beautiful trippy tapestries for super cheap, so I bought one. :)</p><p>I waited around the North Coast stage for Wolfgang, and listened to <b>Sbtrkt</b>'s opening set.  I thought it was pretty good.  Not my kind of music, bit it definitely had groove to it.  Nice and smooth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>He finished, and the roadies started setting up the stage for <b>Wolfgang Gartner</b>.  10 minutes he hopped on stage to NO sound.  It took them a couple of minutes to fix that, and then he was off.  His set included many of his hits, so it felt much like a concert than a DJ set.  His filler tracks were not for me... I thought I liked this guy, but his set was very uninspired.  No where near what his essential sounded like.  It was pretty disappointing...  though maybe he was nervous and played it safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Here's the first 16 minutes of him on stage: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g</a></p><p>While he was jammin his hits, the crowd began to grow immensely.  There was a good amount of area to move at the start, but after 15 minutes, it was wall to wall bodies.  Hot sweaty half-naked bodies dripping with sweat from the 90, 95 degree weather.  I wore the wrong clothes to this pit, so I got out of the crowd to avoid drenching my night club garb.</p><p>Wolfgang finished his set in an hour with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q">Wolfgang Gartner - Undertaker</a>, then exited the stage to make way for <b>David Guetta</b>.  David Guetta is a horrible sellout producer who doesn't know how to DJ.  He can sequence songs, but everyone can do that these days.</p><p>He got up on stage and starting blaring the most generic EDM.  It was probably some track he's known for.  The words "Nothing but the beat" scrolled on the LCD display, so that can probably ID the song.  As the song built, he constantly interrupted the track by telling the crowd how this is his biggest gig in Chicago, and how we're all lucky, or whatever.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>As soon as the generic beat dropped, I took off.  I don't need to hear this.  Also, the weather was quite nauseating.  It was 90 some degrees with absolutely NO wind, so all the cigarette smoke stayed around the entire crowd.  From the setting, you'd think the were blowing smoke machines, but it was all disgusting cigarettes.  The worst smell in the world, coupled with some of the most horrible sounds in the world.</p><p>So, I left and went to Lou Malnati's for my favorite Chicago pizza, before heading back downtown for Zabiela's after party.</p><div class='title'><b>James Zabiela @ Sound-Bar</b></div><p>After eating a whole deepdish pizza, I took off for downtown and made it to the Sound-bar line around 11pm.  I was met by a line around the block, and it took about 50 minutes to make it into the club.  I finally made it in around Midnight, and had to pay a $10 cover, but it was worth it.</p><p>Sound Bar was exactly how I remembered it.  This place had not changed in the last 7 years.  Speakers lined the entire dance floor, so no matter where you were, you were standing in the best spot to hear the music.  And it is loud.  SO LOUD.  But the music is still crystal clear.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp"  /></p><p>As I entered, there was a couple in the booth tag teamin opening duties.  It was pretty cute, and they played some of the smoothest Prog House, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA">David August - Hamburg is for Lovers</a>.  The set already felt close to Sasha's Never say Never sound, but the plucked that one directly from his latest Usiaha set.  Man, I love that song.</p><p>Halfway through, the guy took over for a couple songs and ramped up the intensity.  One of the songs was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8">Moby - Raining again (Steve Angello Remix)</a>.  Once the girl got control of the decks, she seemed a little annoyed and quickly pulled it back into an amazing groove.</p><p>These two were pretty awesome.  I must know their names.  They continued until 1:30-ish, when James Zabiela took stage.  It took him a little while to set up his stuff, and around 1:45, he began.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp"  /></p><p>His set was incredible.  High energy, but not offense or pandering.  Several songs came from Sasha and John Digweed's playlist.  I recognized some of them, but the only one I could ID was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YtWG-qU1jw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YtWG-qU1jw">Layo &amp; Bushwacka - What do you say Now</a>.</p><p>He threw in plenty of effects on top of the normal tracks with his iPad, and some other toys.  And he played a couple break tracks LIVE too!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp"  /></p><p>I recorded the first hour and a half of his set, but stopped to take some pictures and enjoy his fantastic set.  Here's a link to the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0</a></p><p>Overall, this night was fantastic.  Last year, The Chemical Brothers rocked my world, and last night, it was James Zabiela.  It was definitely one of my top 5 music experiences of the year, alongside Sasha, Digweed, Shpongle, and OTT.</p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (24)
