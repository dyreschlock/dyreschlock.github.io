| October 19, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>After getting a Mister FPGA last year, I wanted to get ALL the accessories and try out everything the system had to offer (within reason). One of the accessories I bought into was TapTo. </p><div class='title'><b>TapTo (or Zaparoo)</b></div><p>TapTo (now renamed Zaparoo due to fear (or reality) of trademark infridgement) is a service that constantly runs in the background on Mister. With a connected NFC reader, any NFC signal it reads will automatically run instructions. The main use of this is having a physical set of cards or objects representing your favorite games. Tap the object and the game runs automatically without having to go through menus. </p><p>It's a fun way of bringing physicality back to a digital platform, and people have let their creativity fly. There's a replica miniature C64 disk drive with an NFC reader inside, and you insert cards like floppies. Some folks have put NFC stickers on their physical game cartridges and use those to boot up games. People print their own NFC cards with various styles and images. People have also made figures with NFC buttons inside. The sky is the limit.</p><p>For me, I thought this was all unnecessary. You're removing one of the advantages of having a digital platform which is reducing your amount of clutter. But, you can have TapTo (Zaparoo) do more than just execute games. You can have it execute button macros. And you can have it execute random games.</p><p>I was most interested in the random games. The standard randomization is to have it choose a console and execute a random games on that console. But, unlike the Analogue Pocket, you can build lists of favorites on the Mister using MGL files. So building lists of my favorite games in each genre, I can Tap a card, and have it run a random Shooter or Puzzle game or Fighting game. These are all single serving games, so it makes sense to randomly try one for 5 or 10 minutes and find a new one.</p><p>But, rather than use printed cards, Nintendo Amiibos use NFC, too. I could register the Pacman Amiibo to boot up a random arcade game, and use Ryu to boot up a Fighter. Dr. Mario for Puzzle games. And for Shooters? A Vic Viper would've been amazing. The closest is Star Fox, but those figures look terrible. I just went with Mega Man.</p><div class='title'><b>NFC Reader</b></div><p>You can use any NFC reader with Mister, but all the official images used a particular one. It was only 764<span class='ja'>円</span> on Aliexpress! So cheap! Why not buy it?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was so small! I was thinking that it would be the size of a trading card, but it's less than half that size. This is great because it has allowed creative folks to sneak it into their enclosures and even in their Mister cases. My Mister case is shoved into the shelf, though, so it's not practical for me to do that.</p><p>I wanted to create a platform that could stick out of shelf for easy placement of Amiibo figures. Because the reader is like a tiny trading card, I thought I could use one of those hard plastic trading card protectors. Just screw the thing in there, and it would make for a pretty piece.</p><div class='title'><b>Hard Plastic Card Protector</b></div><p>Amazon had a few different sizes of these sandwich plate style plastic card protectors available, so I bought a standard trading card size and a smaller size closer to the dimensions of the NFC reader. This one:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" /></a></p><p>Here's the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1">Amazon Link</a>. Now, a year later, it's out of stock, but I bought it for only 660<span class='ja'>円</span>. Maybe that's expensive for a single card protector, but I think it's a good price for an NFC enclosure.</p><p>Although, with buying this protector, I wasn't really thinking about how the reader was going to slip between the two plastic plates. A card is as thin as paper. The PCB of the reader is thicker than that, plus it has a USB-C connector on it. The protector came with a thin plastic frame border for the card to hold it in place, but that would not work with the reader.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, the protector was a good size, but I did not think about the USB-C connector. I wanted the PCB more centered, but the USB-C plug on the cable is WAY thicker than the connector. The USB-C connector would have to be flush with the outer rim of the plastic for it to connect.</p><p>The included screws weren't longer enough for added height, so I had to buy some new ones. My local hardware store was able to identify the guage of the screws at M4. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/IMG_2660.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/IMG_2660.webp">They sold these packs of screws, nuts, and washers.</a> I had a few different lengths from some other projects, but I bought one of those packs with 15mm length screws.</p><p>So, I ultimately used the following:</p><p>4 Screws - M4 Size - 15mm Length<br/>4 Nuts - M4 Size<br/>8 Washers - M4 Size<br/>4 Thumb Nuts - Reusing the ones including with the protector.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was a little tight, but it had to be to hold the USB-C connector in place. If it was too loose, the plates wouldn't hold it and you couldn't plug it in without pushing the PCB in further. Although, too tight and it could've cracked the plates or warped the connector. Adding the washers and screws gave it just enough height to hold it in place well enough. Although, it still slipped around and it could be pulled out easily.</p><p>The perfect solution would be to design a 3D printed bracket that could be flush with all edges of the plates and hold the NFC reader in place.</p><div class='title'><b>3D Printed Bracket</b></div><p>So, after almost a year after putting the plates together, I finally designed a bracket. I didn't realize that my sister had a small 3D printer, so it was the perfect excuse to finally make this thing. Her model of printer was a ToyBox, a more accessible consumer level printer which allowed her kids to make little figurines and such. It also accepted custom STL files, so you could still print whatever.</p><p>Looking online, <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" title="https://www.tinkercad.com/">TinkerCad</a> was recommended as an easy online program for creating STL files. And it was really easy to figure out how to move around the view, create objects, and also create negative objects which cut into the solid shapes ultimately creating and shaping your vision.</p><p>Being very precise and measuring all lengths using a tape measure, I put together the model. The plates measured 74mm by 74mm, and I added 5mm height. The NFC reader measured 40mm by 61mm, so I added some grooves for the reader to rest into the model and stay in place. I added rounded corners and measured the screw holes. I also added some divots for the washers.</p><p>It did not take long to create the model. I cut out more of the solid areas to use less material when printing. Also, I flipped the model upside down thinking that it would be better to have the flat areas printed first.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" /></p><p>Here's the file: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing">Google Docs / TapTo Bracket Thin Upside-Down.stl</a></p><p>My sister had several failed attempts trying to print it for some reason. I've never owned a 3D printer, but it seems like there's so much variance in print quality depending on properly seeding the model to the bench, using quality materials, making sure the printer head is clean to allow clean material on the bench, the speed of building the model, and generally just the overall quality and precision of the printer itself. Seems like a nightmare.</p><p>My friend Jason was coming to visit, so I asked if he knew anyone with a decent printer setup. And he was able to get an clean print of my file.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was an exact clean print! It felt nice and sturdy compared to other 3D printed parts I've had before.

The recent ADGQ run of Crazy Taxi resparked some dormant brain cells and reminded me of all the arcade fun the console had to offer. Ultimately, back in the day, I would shelf the console in favor of the Playstation 2 and its library of much deeper story telling games. But, the console would occasionally get pulled out of storage when friends were around.</p><p>With this wave of nostalgia, I purchased several hardware mods to build an ultimate Dreamcast with all my favorite games available to play at a touch. I received all the packages, but my Dreamcast was half a world away in the United States. This summer, I returned home, and now I have all of my original Dreamcast hardware on hand, and finally took the weekend to put everything together.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Spoilers.

After really crawling into my memory about when this happened, I do recall hooking it up to my LCD monitor a few times. But I never used it that way for long periods of time because it was a nuisance to my computer set up.</p><p>Second, I had also forgotten about some other prior modding. 2007 was probably the last time I had used my Dreamcast. At that time, I had purchased some new Shmup releases and the discs would scrap along the shell inside of the disc tray. <a href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast" title="/end-gen-dreamcast">I made a few modifications</a>, and eventually <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.webp">taped the lid sensor</a> to always be closed.</p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast Mods</b></div><p>For modding and upgrading the Dreamcast, I purchased the following:</p><p>- <b>GDEmu Disc Emulator</b> (8019<span class='ja'>円</span> / $53.46)<br/>- <b>Noctua Fan Replacement</b> (4924<span class='ja'>円</span> / $32.82)<br/>- <b>DreamPSU Power Supply Replacement</b> (3304<span class='ja'>円</span> / $22.03)<br/>- <b>Console Shell Replacement</b> (in Smoke Black) (4994<span class='ja'>円</span> / $33.29)<br/>- <b>Bitfunk Dreamcast HDMI Adapter</b> (2519<span class='ja'>円</span> / $16.79)<br/>- <b>Retro Fighters D6 Controller</b> (released in Feburary 2025) ($65.89)<br/>- <b>8BitMods VMU Pro</b> (in Smoke Black) (released in November 2025) ($94.44)<br/>- <b>128gb SD Card</b> (2865<span class='ja'>円</span> / $18.77)</p><p>The top 5 hardware mods were purchased from AliExpress from various retailers. I bought the D6 Controller from Retro Fighters directly. The VMU Pro isn't out yet, but it's only available through the 8BitMods site. Those prices include shipping to Japan. Maybe it's a bit expensive, but I think it's a small price to have a dedicated machine that can easily play all of these great games.</p><p>I should note that understanding which mods to buy and what was required came from another one of Tito's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA">Macho Nacho YouTube videos</a>, similar to <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">my PS2 build</a>. He put all of this stuff together a couple of years ago.</p><p>Ultimately, I decided to skip using the DreamPSU and the HDMI Adapter. Since its release, the DreamPSU has had <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html" title="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html">some criticism</a>. It seems like the DreamPSU doesn't really offer anything new to the Dreamcast, and could potential cause harm. If there's nothing wrong with your current Dreamcast power supply, then there's no reason to get rid of it. </p><p>I skipped the HDMI adapter because I am able to get crisp video through the VGA box. I can pass the VGA and audio signal into my OSSC, and use that to display on my TV through HDMI. Also, the HDMI adapter works with the VGA signal, so the few games that don't work with VGA won't work with it anyway.</p><p>My Saturday afternoon was spent replacing the Dreamcast shell and installing the GDemu and the fan.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's important to note that the GDemu only works on <b><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.webp">version VA1</a></b> consoles, denoted by the circled 1 on the bottom sticker. Revision VA1 consoles are the most common, so you most likely own that one. VA0 consoles were only produced through mid-1999, so perhaps only launch models in the US were VA0. The VA1 started production in mid-1999 and continued through late 2000. VA2 revision models began production around October and December 2000, but so they may have come to market in early 2001, a few months before Sega announced the Dreamcast was done.</p><div class='title'><b>Disassembly</b></div><p>The Dreamcast can be completely taken apart using a Phillips head screwdriver. </p><p>The disassembly starts with the 4 screws keeping the outer shell in place. You'll need to remove the modem to get at the 4th corner screw. With the shell removed, nearly all the inner components are visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The GD reader is the large piece in the middle. We'll replace that with the GDemu unit later. The left component is the power supply. The on/off switch in the front left is plugged into it. The controller port assembly is the component in the front. It has a battery that manages the internal clock. It also gives power to the fan on the right. Everything sits on top of a metal shield. The Dreamcast motherboard is between this shield and another one on the very bottom.</p><p>The first component to remove is the GD reader. Mine was attached using 2 screws, even though there were holes for 3 screws. Maybe I lost one while I was messing around in 2007.  Be sure to pull it out as an entire unit with the metal plate on the bottom. You don't need to disassemble the reader itself.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Next is the power supply. The power supply is held in place by 2 screws and its connection to the motherboard. First, unplug the on/off switch connected in the back and then remove the screws. The motherboard connection is really strong, so it can be difficult to pull it off with finesse. I rocked mine back and forth a bit, but be careful not too do this too much as it could dislodge the connector from the motherboard.</p><p>The power supply has a plastic shield that sits between it and the surrounding components, so don't lose that.</p><p>The next component to remove is the controller assembly in the front. You'll need to remove the power cable going to the fan and unplug the ribbon cable going to the motherboard. Both cables are removed pretty easily. Just gently rock them back and forth with a little bit of force and they'll come out. The component is held in place with 4 screws next to the controller ports.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At this point, there are only 3 more components to remove. The fan and the power button are only held in place with 2 screws each. Those are easy to remove. The direction they're installed is important, but it's easy to tell which was they go. We'll replace the fan later, so we don't need to worry about that one.</p><p>The final component is the motherboard, sandwiched between two metal shields, screwed to the bottom of the shell with 8 screws. After removing the screws, the upper metal shield is still attached to the motherboard with a few plastic pins. Removing them is unnecessary, so leave them alone. You can remove the upper shield and motherboard together as a single piece. The video plugs are set into the shell, so it takes a bit of movement to find the right angle, but eventually you can pull the motherboard out.</p><p>All that remains is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.webp">the bottom shield</a> with two termal pads.

Then, I screwed in the power button. It's important to note that the front plastic controller port panel must be set in place before putting the motherboard in. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, make sure the termal pads are in the correct position on the bottom plate before putting the motherboard in.</p><p>One small problem with my reassembly was a single screw <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.webp">being misaligned</a>. All other points of the motherboard were perfect except for this small spot. I'm not sure why this happened, but I decided to proceed rather than remove everything and solve the problem. The screws only held the board in place and it was very secure without this screw.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After the motherboard was secure, I put the power supply back into place, and made sure to put the plastic shield in the correct position. Make sure the power button cable moves underneath the component like it did before. Push the board into its connector, screw it in with the 2 screws, and connect the power button. The power plug in the back should be flush with the shell.</p><p>In the front, angle the controller port into the shell, then use the 4 screws to attach it to the build. Then plug in the ribbon cable.</p><p>So far, everything should be pretty smooth, and we have only the fan and the GDemu left.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast GDemu Disc Emulator</b></div><p>The GDemu is a PCB with an SD card slot and a button. It plugs into the motherboard in the exact position as the GD reader and acts as an emulator. Here's the GDemu board.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just as the GD reader reads the discs and gives data to the motherboard, the GDemu also sends game data. You fill up the SD card with a bunch of games, and the GDemu reads the currently selected "disc" and sends the data to the board. The SD card needs to be in a specific format, but I did that <a href="/old/v7/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation" title="/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation">preparation back in January</a>.</p><p>On the SD card, each disc is stored in a specific numbered position, so the GDemu ultimately acts like a disc changer. The first CD in the list is the default disc loaded when the Dreamcast is turned on. This is where the GDemu menu application is stored. From the menu, you can choose any game you installed. Additionally, you can switch games/discs using the button. Pushing the button loads the next disc in the list. This is really only useful for multi-disc games, though.</p><div class='title'><b>GDemu Assembly and Installation</b></div><p>The GDemu package came with everything you see here: the GDemu PCB, SD card extender, an 8gb SD card, some plastic pieces, and some screws.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It did not come with any instructions, so I was supposed to figure out how everything went together on my own. It's not too difficult to understand, but there are a few things that aren't so obvious. I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU">this YouTube video</a> of a guy putting together nearly the same thing, which helped me out.</p><p>Technically, you don't need any of the plastic parts to connect the GDemu. You can plug the GDemu into the motherboard directly and be done with it. However, the purpose of the plastic pieces is to seel the internal components from the outside and allow the fan to do its job of efficiently venting hot air. Whether or not the fan actually does this is a different question, but its best to try and help the Dreamcast accomplish this original goal. </p><p>The first step in assembly is attaching the SD card extender to the large plastic cover. There are 2 tiny screws used to do this. (I had to use a smaller Phillips screwdriver to accomplish this.) <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.webp">With the SD card extender in position</a>, the tiny screws don't screw into it. They screw into the post beside it, and hold the extender in place.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" /></a></p><p>That YouTube video was very helpful for understanding that.</p><p>The next step is screwing the GDemu board into the same plastic assembly. Connect the SD card extender into the SD card on the GDemu board. The ribbon cable is too long, but it's okay to have the extra length spill out of the back. There's nothing behind it that is harmful. You may be able to fold the cable inside of the plastic piece, too.</p><p>The board attaches with two screws. Be sure to put the button into the plastic shell before screwing in the board. Also, be sure not to screw the board too tight. The bigger plastic button needs some clearance so it can click the board's button easily.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Now there should be one long screw, one short screw, and one more plastic tube piece left. After plugging the GDemu into the motherboard, it becomes obvious where these pieces go. The back end of the plastic cover lines up perfectly with one of the GD reader screw holes. This is for the short screw. The front edge of the GDemu board hovers over another screw hole. The plastic tube props up the board and allows the screw to pass through into the base.</p><p>With everything assembled and screwed into place, the GDemu board should be held above the metal shield. It looks pretty good!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Noctua Fan Mod</b></div><p>The final bit to install is the Noctua Fan.

The Noctua fan takes up more space inside the Dreamcast and it interferes with the lid hatch. The mechanical component is a full squared piece and a section of it needs to be removed. Because of this, we've given those other two printed pieces as a lid hatch replacement.</p><p>This is where the terrible print quailty of the components caused troubles. The inner peg is meant to be shoved through the larger peg and create the lid hatch. My inner peg was too fat, or the hole was too thin, so when pushing the peg through the hole it didn't go all the way. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The peg was about 2mm longer, which meant the whole piece couldn't fit into the lid flushly. I tried shoving the peg in further and wiggling it into place, but it was still too long. I used a nail file to make the piece a little thinner and that worked. Although, not really. Now the piece was too loose so when the Open Tray button was pressed, the lid latch wouldn't go back into its extended position, so the lid couldn't be closed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lid latch component is very delicate. It needs to be loose enough to freely move back and forth between the two screw posts. When the button is pressed, it moves one way, then the spring brings it back to its original position. So, the two pieces also need to have a complete strong bond together so the spring doesn't pull the latch back on its own. Using the nail file, the middle piece was now too loose. Why did they print this as two pieces? </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I still had some epoxy from an earlier project, so I glued the two pieces together. The cheapness of the material probably helped fuse the two pieces together even better than usual.</p><p>Even so, the piece was still too rigid in the lid. I used my screwdriver head to widen the holes even more, and the piece finally moved smoothly. Much like the button component, these screws should not be too tight. They should be just tight enough to hold the piece into position and allow it to move freely back and forth. The lid finally opened and closed like it was supposed to after all this work. (This was the longest part of the physical build.)</p><div class='title'><b>Complete</b></div><p>With all the pieces of the puzzle finally put into place, I secured the top part of the shell on to the base, tightened the outer 4 screws, and the build was complete.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I plugged the VGA box into my OSSC, plugged video and power in to the Dreamcast, turned it on, and it worked perfectly the first time.

The OSSC translates that into an HDMI signal which I'm plugging into my TV. Even though I just bought a new TV, my TV doesn't really like 480p signals and it really doesn't like 960p signals.</p><p>FirebrandX had created the "perfect" timings for the Dreamcast a couple years ago with the following settings:</p><p><pre>Sync opt. > <br/>    Analog sync LDF = Off<br/>Output opt. > <br/>    480p/576p proc = Line2x<br/>Sampling opt. ><br/>    Sampling phase = 45 deg<br/>    480p in sampler = DTV 480p<br/>    Allow upsample2x = off<br/>< Adv. timing > 480p:<br/>    H. samplerate = 858<br/>    H. Synclen = 62<br/>    H. backporch = 111<br/>    H. active = 640<br/>    V. synclen = 6<br/>    V. backporch = 34<br/>    V. active = 480</pre></p><p>This causes a black screen for me because my TV doesn't like 960p signals. Turning the output option back to PassThru also creates a black screen with these settings. If I leave all these values at default, I get a very beautiful image, but unfortunately it's stretched to the 16:9 ratio as shown above. My TV doesn't have a 4:3 option, so I would need another box that converts 480p or 960p to a 1080p signal and allows 4:3 to be forced.</p><p>Using the Bitfunx HDMI converter does force 4:3 and gives a clean image, but there are no video options at all. You can't do scanlines or change the fuzziness of model edges. I dunno... it doesn't look right to me.</p><p>So, between choosing an imperfect toolbox or a single use hammer, I think I'll stick with the toolbox. If I somehow can afford a RetroTink4k in the future, then that's probably the best path for me and my TV.</p><div class='title'><b>RetroFighters D6 Controller</b></div><p>When I built my setup for the Playstation 2, I also bought an 8bitdo Retro Receiver so I could use a modern wireless controller with the old games.

While many of the games have been released and made available on other consoles and platforms throughout the years, there are still several games orphaned on the Dreamcast. Plus, the authentic feel of the playing the game, and hearing the original sounds and music is often not well replicated elsewhere.</p><p>Because of this, and 8bitmods eventual release of their VMU Memcard Pro, I decided to look into Dreamcast mods to determine what it would take to put together a console capable of playing its vast library via hard drive or sd card, similar to the <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2</a> set up I did last year.</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, it does not seem difficult at all. Many moderns mods are parts replacement for internal components. You still need to open up the console and take things apart, but you aren't soldering any mod chips or replacing capacitors. You just unplug this component, remove it, and plug in this one instead. Very plug and play. Many of these parts are pretty cheap through AliExpress too!</p><p>Anyways, I ordered a bunch of parts this week. My Dreamcast is back in the states, so even though the parts will arrive over the next two weeks, assembly will have to wait until after summer.</p><p>In the meantime, I can prepare.</p><div class='title'><b>Dreamcast GDemu</b></div><p>The main mod used in the Dreamcast is the <b>GDemu</b>. It is a PCB replacement for the entire GD-ROM reader assembly. To install, you need to take out the GD-ROM disc reader, and put this PCB in there instead. The GDemu board has an SD card reader attached to it, and this is where all of the games are stored.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8572_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I bought a SanDisk Extreme 128gb card, Class 10. Game are around 1.2gb each, which I thought would be enough space. But, I'm already getting close to the upper limit of space. A 256gb cards would've been better. I might upgrade later.</p><p>Some people online have complained about compatibility, but I think those complaints predate the current version of GDemu. More recent videos and posts have said similar SD cards work just fine for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Format SD Card</b></div><p>The GDemu requires the SD card to be FAT-32 format. One person said that using 64k byte cluster sizes can help with readability, too, so I opted for that. (It probably doesn't matter.) Using Diskutil, Macs will format FAT-32 with a cluster size of 32k bytes. So, for the 64k byte cluster size, you can use the following terminal commands.</p><p><pre>diskutil unmount SD_IDENTIFIER<br/>sudo newfs_msdos -F 32 -c 128 -v VOLUMEID /dev/SD_IDENTIFIER<br/>diskutil mount SD_IDENTIFIER</pre></p><p>The drive must be unmounted first before formatting it, then the <code>newfs_msdos</code> command is used. <code>VOLUMEID</code> is the new name of your SD card, and <code>SD_IDENTIFIER</code> is the identifier used in disk utils.  Check <code>diskutil list</code> for the correct identifier. <code>-F 32</code> is for FAT-32. <code>-c 128</code> is for the 64 byte cluster size.</p><p>(The reasons for 128 with -c is a little complicated. Overall, we want a 64k byte size. In bytes, this is 64x1024 = 65,536 bytes. The SD card has a block size of 512 bytes, so we do 65,536/512, which is 128. This number describes the number of blocks in a cluster.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8592_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, our SD card is in the current format. Now, we need games.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>To combat piracy, Sega and Yamaha created a new disc format for the Dreamcast called the GD-ROM. GD-ROMs held up to 1gb of information, surpassing the 650mb limits of the CD-ROM. One unique feature of the GD-ROM was that information was "burned" into the CD from the outside in, rather than inside out, like CD-ROMs. Both of these together were expected to make the Dreamcast secure from people burning their own games.</p><p>Within one year after its North American release, this was circumvented. Even though games were on GD-ROMs, the Dreamcast could still read CD-ROMs, so hacker group Utopia created the infamous Utopia disc which forced the Dreamcast to boot in CD-ROM mode. Games could then be burned to CD-ROMs and run nearly identically to the GD-ROMs. Some stuff had to be cut from games to fit into the 650mb CD limit, but many GD-ROMs filled their discs with dummy information anyways.  Much of this dummy information was just pushing the data to the outer edge of the disc.</p><p>Because of this, Dreamcast games can be found online in two main formats: GDI and CDI files. GDI is usually preferred as the CDI version could have cut content to fit into 650mb. Although, the problem with GDI files is that they are always 1.1gb or 1.2gb to simulate the full size of the disc. It's possible to shrink these sizes, cutting out the extra content, but that can still cause some compatibility issues.</p><div class='title'><b>Game Management</b></div><p>Games are copied to the SD card, but the GDemu requires a specific file and folder structure. You also need files for the GD Menu, too.</p><p>I found this amazing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4">YouTube video</a> from Derek Pascarella fully describing the software-wide of how to set up and manage games for your Dreamcast using the GDemu. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjUgXkdiVq4">Here's that link</a> again. The rest of this post is basically going to parrot this video.</p><p>You will need to download 2 things for Games and Menu management. And there's one more thing to download to edit Boxart and Metadata for games in the menu.</p><p>1) The <a href="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager" title="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager">GD Menu Card Manager</a> is how you will manage all your games<br/>2) <a href="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu" title="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu">Open Menu</a> is the most modern menu used in the Dreamcast to choose your games.<br/>3) The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing">OpenMenu DAT Tool</a> for editing boxart and metadata.</p><p>The Open Menu DAT Tool is available through the dreamcast-talk forum, which is member only and a little difficult to gain access. The video has a link to their personal Google Drive for the file. The link above connects to my Google Drive, where I also have a copy.</p><div class='title'><b>GD Menu Card Manager</b></div><p>The <a href="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager" title="https://github.com/sonik-br/GDMENUCardManager">GD Menu Card Manager</a> works for both Mac and PC. When you open the program, choose your SD card from the menu. You can choose whether to install GDmenu or Open Menu. Any game you want install, just drag into the window, rename to whatever you want, and hit Save Changes at the bottom.</p><p>Overall, the GDemu wants each disc in its own folder, numbered starting from 01. The 01 folder is special and it must contain the GDemu menu (GDmenu or openMenu). The Card Manager will copy the correct files for you. From 02, each folder is for a game disc. Again, the Card Manager will manage all these folders for you. When adding new games, you can have them alphabetically sorted, and the Manager will rearrange everything for you.</p><p>Some options are missing in the Mac version of the Card Manager. I'm not able to shrink the GDI files for some reason. This is probably using something only available on PC. However, as the video mentions, shrinking GDI files is not a one-size-fits-all hammer solution. For full compatibility, it's best not to shrink.</p><div class='title'><b>Game Serial Numbers</b></div><p>Much like Playstation games, Dreamcast games each have a unique identifier. All retail games do this, but hacks, ports, and other self-published indie titles sometimes don't. For example, the Dreamcast port of Divi-Dead and Grand Theft Auto III share the same serial number when added to the card manager, T00001.</p><p>Just like the game title, you can freely edit serial numbers to whatever you like.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250124_gdemu/IMG_8587_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I changed Grand Theft Auto III's serial number to TGTA3. The only thing this disrupts is the boxart and metadata used for Open Menu, and we can fix that.</p><div class='title'><b>Open Menu</b></div><p>When the Menu Card Manager saves changes to the SD card, it copies all the menu information it has locally to the SD card. On PC, all of its dlls and subfolders are clearly visible. The openMenu files are stored in the following location: <code>tools/openMenu/menu_data</code>. This is true for the Mac version, too, but all the files are hidden inside of the app. Click on the GDMENUCardManager.app file and "Show Package Contents." From there, the openMenu files are located here: <code>Contents/MacOS/tools/openMenu/menu_data</code></p><p>By default, there's not much there, but that's where there <a href="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu" title="https://github.com/megavolt85/openmenu">Open Menu</a> download comes in. Unzip the latest release and copy all of the contents of <code>menu_data</code> into the above location. Click on Save Changes in the Menu Manager, and your openMenu is completely up to date.</p><div class='title'><b>Boxart and Metadata Changes</b></div><p>Among the Open Menu files we copied to the GD Menu app were 3 DAT files, <code>BOX.DAT</code>, <code>ICON.DAT</code>, and <code>META.DAT</code>. These are file databases which house boxart, game icon, and metadata for all the Dreamcast games. It has all retail games, indie games, and most other ports and hacks. But, it doesn't have everything. And if you changed any serial numbers, it definitely doesn't have those games.</p><p>The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing">OpenMenu DAT Tool</a> will allow you to edit them. You can add new images (PNG format only) and create the menu icon from that. You can add and edit any metadata for games, too.</p><p>Save all the changes back to the DAT files for the Card Manager. And then "Save Changes" in the Card Manager to apply the changes to the SD card.</p><div class='title'><b>Preparation Complete</b></div><p>For the time being, my preparations are complete. I have loaded my SD card with over 100 discs. You can take a look at what I have available by viewing my <a href="/old/v7/modded-console-game-inventory" title="/modded-console-game-inventory">Game Inventory</a>.</p><p>I'll start getting the physical mods in the mail over the next few weeks. Then after summer vacation, I should have my Dreamcast available to install the mods.</p><div class='title'><b>Update! October 2025</b></div><p>9 months after doing this preparation, I have finally put together my <a href="/old/v7/modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="/modding-a-sega-dreamcast">modded Dreamcast</a>, and it looks beautiful.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After putting the mods together and plugging it in, all of my preparation worked perfectly the first time. The menu displayed all the games, selecting the games worked perfectly, and I could finally experience Crazy Taxi like I had way back in its golden years. (Unfortunately, I have no muscle memory for it. :/ )</p><p>Besides adding a few more games, there were two additional changes I made from the preparation above.</p><div class='title'><b>Updated Box Art</b></div><p>I had a few games on my Dreamcast which didn't have art, so I used the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16sek32schuAnjpluGbAKP9B5jhPulsQF/view?usp=sharing">OpenMenu DAT Tool</a> to update the DAT files used for openMenu.</p><p>Here are <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UF2sw7-ckEGQYH-r16O6ovVFYVUHFfZa/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UF2sw7-ckEGQYH-r16O6ovVFYVUHFfZa/view?usp=sharing">my updated DAT files</a>, if you wanted to use them.</p><div class='title'><b>Atomiswave Games</b></div><p>If you're looking around for Dreamcast games to download, you probably noticed that dreamcast-talk forum users megavolt85 and yzb ported games from the Atomiswave arcade platform.</p><p>The Dreamcast itself was basically a consolized version of Sega's Naomi arcade unit, which is why all the games look nearly identical to their arcade counterparts. Sega teamed with Sammy and SNK to create another arcade unit called the Atomiswave, which is also basically a Dreamcast. There were over 30 games developed for the machine, and 26 of them have been ported to the Dreamcast.</p><p>These don't natively play using the GDemu because of a small failsafe. In the <code>GDEMU.ini</code> file in the root of the SD card, adding the line <code>image_tests=0</code> will remove the failsafe ensuring correctly sized media being sent to the motherboard, and allows all Atomswave games to be played. There are no negative effects, to my knowledge.

| October 25, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>My retro gaming hardware collection has grown recently. The Analogue Pocket introduced me into a gaming platform possible of playing decades of games across dozens of consoles, handhelds, and arcade boards. Recently, I got a Mister which expanded this reach even further.</p><p>Last year, <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">I made a page</a> that catalogued all of the notable games I had on my Analogue Pocket. And now I've revamped that curated list into an overall Digital Retro Game Library. This lists all the notable games I have available on both the Pocket and the Mister. More platforms may be added in the future, like PS2 and Gamecube.</p><p><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><b>Digital Retro Game Library</b></a></p><p class='img'><a href="/apps/pocket" title="/apps/pocket"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playlists</b></div><p>Originally, these games were being collected to build Genre lists of games using the now-canceled Playlist feature for the Analogue Pocket. The idea was that I could scroll through a Genre of games and choose one to play without having to pay attention to the hardware platform it was designed for. I was collecting all this information using <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-utils" title="/analogue-pocket-utils">Pocket Utils</a>, a collection of Java programs that I wrote to manage games and stuff on my Pocket.</p><p>Later, after the Playlist feature was buried and gone, I decided to put all of this information into a webpage so I could at least see everything visually. This was the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="/analogue-pocket-curated-games">Pocket Curated Games</a> page, the first iteration of this project.</p><p>Later again and recently, I got a Mister. The Mister is the premiere FPGA gaming platform, and the Analogue Pocket is a handheld FPGA device. FPGA cores are written for specific hardware, so there are advantages to both platforms, although the Mister can generally handle more complicated systems and it's open source. Because of this, people have built several features and accessories on top of the platform. One thing implemented a couple years ago was Shortcuts. Rather than turning on a core and choosing a game, you could choose a game directly from the main menu. This is exactly like how I wanted Playlists to work on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>So, by updating the programs in Pocket Utils to look for Mister games, I could add all that information in the database. And writing a new program, I could automatically make shortcuts to all the games I have managed in my database, essentially creating all the Playlists I wanted from the beginning.</p><p>The Pocket Curated Page being revamped into the Digital Retro Game Library now shows all those games, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Launching Games</b></div><p>There's another really nice feature available on the Mister called TapTo. TapTo is a service that runs in the background on Mister and accepts game executing commands. The main idea for this feature was to bring back physicality to the Mister, which is a sole digital platform. Using a physical NFC reader you can "tap" a physical NFC card (or anything with an NFC signal) and it will automatically launch the game associated with it.</p><p>I'm not interested in having a huge collection of cards for individual games. But, I was very interested in TapTo's feature of launching RANDOM games. By sorting all of my shortcuts to games in Genre folders, I could launch a random Shooter or random Fighter.</p><p>Earlier this year, the TapTo service was upgraded to accept network requests. Any device connected to the same Wifi network could send a command to TapTo and it'll execute it. They launched a phone app that took advantage of this, but the request service is wide open. Anything can send commands.</p><p>So, combining yet another project with this, I added functionality in my chat bot, <a href="/old/v7/schlock-bot" title="/schlock-bot">Schlock Bot</a>, to accept requests to launch random games from my Genres. With Pocket Utils updated to manage my Mister games, Schlock Bot can read this information too, and launch individual games.</p><p><pre>!game Shooter<br/>!game Panzer Dragoon (Saturn)</pre></p><p>These commands can be typed in my Discord and read by Schlock Bot.</p><div class='title'><b>Going Further</b></div><p>One annoying thing about typing in games to launch in Discord is that you have to type them correctly. Dr. Mario has a period in it, so if you type Dr Mario, it won't find the game. Also, I have a Gameboy Color version of Dr. Mario, too, so which one do you want? You need to be annoyingly specific.</p><p>So, using the Digital Game Library, you can click on a game, it'll write that execution command in Discord, Schlock Bot will read the command (if it's running), and then launch the game on Mister (if that's running too).</p><p>As such, the Digital Retro Game Library not only shows all my available games, but it's also a method of selecting games to play on the Mister.</p><p>There's a lot of moving parts in between clicking a game and it launching on the Mister. It would be a lot better if the webpage sent the request to Schlock Bot directly. But, this janky thing works for the time being. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Future Additions</b></div><p>Getting back to the Library, prior to getting a Mister, I set up a Playstation 2 with a game server to play all of those classic games. I made an <a href="/old/v7/playstation-2-game-inventory" title="/playstation-2-game-inventory">inventory</a> page that shows all of those games, but I'm thinking about adding them in this library, too. Also, I may mod a gamecube in the future to play a library of those games. I will want to have a library of those games listed somewhere, so adding them here or on the PS2 inventory page makes sense.</p><p>In addition to more games, I was thinking of putting download links to my save files for each game, too. I'm already doing this on the PS2 Game Inventory page with memory cards.</p><p>We'll see. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to MemCard Pro2 for Playstation 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">MemCard Pro2 for Playstation 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 17, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Late last year, English gaming company 8bitmods released a device called the <b>MemCard Pro 2</b>. It is advertised as "the last memory card you'll ever need." It works for both Playstation 1 and Playstation 2, and it stores all of its data for memory on an SD card. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After putting together my <a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">Playstation 2 set up</a>, I wanted some way of being able to backup all of my save data from my decade of playing the Playstation 1 and 2. Having a memory card that uses an SD card was what I wanted, and I found this.</p><p>But, it does MUCH more than just store save files on an SD card. It has a paging system, so you can easily create a new card with the press of a button. It identifies games with Game Id, so it can create unique memory cards for each game. And the card has Wifi, so all of its functions can be controlled by a web interface!</p><div class='title'><b>Updating</b></div><p>Before doing anything, you need an SD card. Each PS2 memory card is 8mb so even having an SD card with 128gb of space is massive over kill. I bought a 64gb Samsung card for around $10 since it seemed to be the cheapest option. 32gb cards were available, but they were around the same price. May as well get a slightly large one. The SD card must be formatted either FAT32 or ExFat. I went with ExFat.</p><p>With the card ready to go, the next necessary step is firmware. You should update to the most recent version for access to all of the current features. Here's the link to the firmware: <a href="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro2/public" title="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro2/public">Latest Firmware Download</a> (new firmware URL as as Oct 2025)</p><p>Put the SD card in the MemCard and put the MemCard in the PS2. Power it on, and it'll start updating. When finished, it is ready to go.</p><div class='title'><b>Wi-Fi</b></div><p>You may think that Wi-Fi is unnecessary for a memory card, but you have so many more methods of control than being limited to the 2-button, small screen interface attached to the PS2. When you want to change card, you can easily do it with a scroll and a click in a web browser.</p><p>Setting up the Wi-Fi has a few steps that are pretty easy. First, you need to hold down the Left button and release to enter the Menu. Click down to Wi-Fi and select it. You'll be given an IP address. Now, the memcard pro is broadcasting as an access point. It wants you to connect to the access point and visit the webpage at that IP address. Going to that IP address will open a webpage to complete the Wi-Fi set up.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In the Setup Wizard, you'll choose a Wi-Fi network to connect to.

You can also update the firmware from here, too, rather than doing it manually.</p><div class='title'><b>Save Management</b></div><p>One of the best features of the Memcard is identifying games using Game_Id. Every disc printed and created for a Playstation 1 and 2 has a unique Game_Id associated with it and the Memcard can identify this ID and automatically create or switch to a virtual memory card used only for that game. It does this by default, but you can change this behavior in the settings.</p><p>That means that you don't need to worry about trying to find which cards have which saves. You also don't have to worry about space on a card because other games won't be there to fill the space. And, even if you do save a lot in one game and use up all of the space, you can create a new page and have up to 8 memory cards for each game.</p><p>All memory cards are stored as virtual drives in the <code>mcd</code> format on the SD card. Unfortunately, you can't modify the contents of the card directly on a PC. So, if you want to add stuff on the card directly, you still need to use uLaunchELF on the PS2.</p><p>There might be something out there that will mount of the drive and give you access because people have written scripts and programs that access the contents of the cards for Save Splitting. But, I haven't found anything yet. Save Splitting is useful when moving the contents of your current memory card stash into the Memcard.</p><div class='title'><b>Transferring Old Memory Cards</b></div><p>I have an old plastic bag full of memory cards from the late 90s and 2000s.

Starting with the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, consoles natively supported HDMI, and now its standard on absolutely everything. Prior to HDMI, RCA composite cables were standard in North America and Japan, while SCART was standard in Europe. But, for North America, the highest quality video you could get used RGB composite cables.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2 Component Cables</b></div><p>For the Playstation 2, the official component cables are one of the best options. But the actual official ones are hard to find and usually expensive. Also, there are many bootlegs cables being sold as official. Signal integrity is very important to analog video, so cheap cables can eat away at the quality. So, the actual best PS2 video cables on the market are the cables from Retrovision.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I think they look cheap on the outside, but the internals are not. The inner components are perfectly shielded and expertly crafted to ensure the highest quality, strongest signal possible from source to destination. They were $30 on Amazon, not too much more expensive than others.</p><div class='title'><b>Signals and Resolutions</b></div><p>For the most part, by default, the Playstation 2 outputs a 480i resolution. In general, this is a 640x480 resolution drawn with interlacing. I'm not an expert, but I have come to understand that interlacing draws the video with overlapping alternating lines. A complete single frame is split into two images alternatingly drawn on top of each other, which creates two frames instead one.</p><p>Modern TVs with HDMI use progressive scan to draw the image on a TV. A single frame is drawn from top to bottom in order without alternating lines. Some Playstation 2 games have the option of output 480p, where p stands for progressive. The OSSC loves a 480p signal because, even though it is being passed as an analog signal, it's in a digital format, and that's what modern TVs want.</p><p>The 480i signal is more annoying. The OSSC needs to convert the interlaced signals into progressive, and it uses bob deinterlacing to do this. Bob deinterlacing takes the half-drawn image from the first frame and treats it as progressive. It's only 240 tall, so it doubles the height. Then it does the same with the next frame, the other half of the image. Another name for this technique is line doubling.</p><p>So, we want to set up the OSSC to handle <b>480p</b> and <b>480i</b> signals.</p><p>People have made a list of all Playstation 2 games that support 480p (and other resolutions) and how to enable it.<br/><a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes" title="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes">https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes</a></p><div class='title'><b>480p Signals</b></div><p>Overall, if a game supports 480p (or any progressive scan format), we want to use it. Using OPL, there's a way to force this. GSM, or <b>Graphics Synthesizer Mode Selector</b>, is another unofficial PS2 app that works with OPL. When choosing a game in OPL, you can hit <code>triangle</code> to enter the Game Settings menu. Then enter the GSM Settings menu. For 480p available games, enable GSM and switch the "Mode" to 480p.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Be sure to save the Game Settings!

In those recent years, no home console had been backwards compatible with its predecessor, mainly because of cartridges. So having a new console being able to play your current game library was a massive boost.</p><p>This was accomplished by including the original Playstation hardware inside of the Playstation 2. Over time, this extra hardware was shrunk, and eventually relegated to software emulation, which wasn't perfect.</p><p>Anyways, with getting OPL and a Games server working for the Playstation 2, I wanted Playstation 1 working in the same way. The overall process for Playstation 1 games is similar to Playstation 2 games, but the steps are different.</p><p>Here is my set up for the Playstation 2 with OPL, the file server, and everything else:<br/><a href="/old/v7/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="/returning-to-the-playstation-2">/returning-to-the-playstation-2</a></p><div class='title'><b>POPStarter</b></div><p>Even though the Playstation 2 has the Playstation 1 hardware for games, the games will be run in software. Unfortunately, there's no way around this. <b>POPS</b> is Sony's Playstation 1 emulator that runs on the ps2, and OPL's method of using this is called POPStarter. It stands for Playstation One Portable Station, probably.</p><p><b>Note</b>: There are two ways of setting up Playstation 1 games and POPstarter using OPL and I'm using the old way. This way is only compatible using OPL Anniversary Edition. The latest versions of OPL have removed this method of execution for a newer method which has a slightly better success rate for compatibility. I'm not sure if it works through SMB, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall, my Playstation 2 setup is streaming games through the ethernet port using an SMB server hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. I need to add POPStarter configuration on my memory card with Free McBoot. And then, there are some additional files required for the file server along with the games.</p><div class='title'><b>POPSTARTER Configuration for the Memory Card</b></div><p>Because I'm running Playstation 1 games from the SMB File Share, I needed to download a specific POPStarter setup for the memory card. I downloaded <b>POPSTARTER.zip</b> found on the following page: <br/><a href="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/">https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/</a></p><p>When unzipped it will give a <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder. This entire folder will be copied to the Free McBoot memory card, but we need to change two things first.</p><p>First, we need to change the <code>IPCONFIG.DAT</code> file. This contains the ip details of the PS2. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PS2-IP-ADDRESS NETMASK GATEWAY</pre></p><p>These details are all found in the Network Settings of OPL. The PS2-IP-ADDRESS is the IP address of the PS2 on the network. The Netmask is the same one in OPL. And the Gateway is the IP address of the File server. All of these are listed in OPL's Network Config menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Note</b>: Originally, my Playstation 2 IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>. POPS does not like it when the IPs of the Playstation 2 and the File Server are on different subnets, so I changed the PS2's IP address in OPL to <code>192.168.2.10</code>. This solved my problem.</p><p>Here is my completed file:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1</pre></p><p>Next, we need to change <code>SMBCONFIG.DAT</code>. This tells popstarter where the files are located on the network. OPL knows where the files are, but it doesn't tell POPS this information when it launches, so we need to add this information here. By default, here are the file contents:</p><p><pre>PC-IP-ADDRESS PS2SMB<br/>username<br/>password</pre></p><p>There's the server's IP address, the server's folder name, and the login details. I'm using the SMB Share setup on the Raspberry Pi, so here are my details:</p><p><pre>192.168.2.1 share</pre></p><p>There are no login details, so those lines are omitted. The share on the Pi is just <code>share</code>, and it's running on that IP.</p><div class='title'><b>Memory Card Installation</b></div><p>The <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder and all of its contents will be copied to the Memory Card with Free McBoot. To do this, we'll need to put all these files on a simple USB Drive and plug that directly into a USB slot of the PS2.</p><p>After turning on the PS2 with Free McBoot, you'll need to open uLaunchELF, which is a file browser for the Playstation 2. The drive marked <code>mass</code> is your USB drive, <code>mc0</code> is the memory card in the first slot, and <code>mc1</code> is the memory card in the second slot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In <code>mass</code>, select (mark) your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder, hit <code>R1</code> to pull up the menu, and select copy. Navigate to <code>mc0</code> for your Free McBoot card, hit <code>R1</code> again, and select paste. This will copy your <code>POPSTARTER</code> folder to the memory card.</p><p>Your memory card setup is complete.</p><div class='title'><b>File Server Files</b></div><p>On the file server, Playstation 1 games are put in the <code>POPS</code> folder, but we need another file for the emulator to work, the emulator itself! The file for the actual emulator is named <code>POPS_IOX.PAK</code>. It's not too difficult to find through a Google search, but this file contains copyrighted information by Sony, so search at your own risk. </p><p>This last file we're going to need is <code>POPSTARTER.ELF</code>. ELF files are applications that run on the Playstation 2, and this is POPStarter application that runs the emulator. When you select a game in OPL, it will open that game with this application.</p><p>With everything set up, now we need some games.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>POPStarter and OPL requires Playstation 1 Games in the VCD format and using the same filename format as PS2 games. When you illegally download any Playstation 1 game, it'll most likely be in the bin/cue format. So, you'll need to convert them.</p><p>The best program to do this with is called <b>PFS BatchKit Manager</b>. It can be found on GitHub here:<br/><a href="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager" title="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager">https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager</a></p><p>PFS BatchKit Manager is a command line program for Windows, so Windows might complain when you try to open it. It should run within your OPL folder on your File server. Conversions are found under the Advanced Menu. Follow this route:</p><p><pre> -> 10. Advanced Menu<br/> -> 1. Conversion<br/> -> 1. Convert .bin to .vcd</pre></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It will search the <code>POPS</code> folder for any bin/cue files, and process them. First, it'll combine all the bin files into a single bin file. Then it will convert to vcd. PFS BatchKit Manager will also rename your files with the Disc ID in the front and with the correct game name from their database.</p><p>I've had the process fail once or twice on large batches of files, so I always convert a few at a time. It can sometimes take a while, too, so I prefer going bit by bit.</p><p>This will complete the process for single disc games. You can open OPL Manager to double check the file names are correct.</p><div class='title'><b>Multi-Disc Games</b></div><p>For games with multiple discs, there is one more step to complete.</p><p>POPStarter doesn't read the PS2's memory card, so it will create a virtual memory card for saving. Memory card files are stored/indexed by Game Id, and this is problem with multi-disc games because each CD has its own Game Id.</p><p>Configuration files must be set up to tell POPStarter you are running a multi-disc game. This will allow memory card sharing among each disc AND it will allow you to swap game discs.</p><p>There's a script you can download called <b>DISCS_POOPER.cmd</b>, also Windows only. Place this script in the same folder with all the discs of a multi-disc game, run the script, and it will create the necessary sub folders and the configuration files needed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" /></a></p><p>You can find this by searching around, but I have a copy of it on my GitHub:<br/><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/blob/03bb3180655a99fb3962c2f889c88d85d5d1404f/POPS/DISCS_POOPER.cmd" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/blob/03bb3180655a99fb3962c2f889c88d85d5d1404f/POPS/DISCS_POOPER.cmd">github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/DISCS_POOPER.cmd</a></p><p>Put these folders and games in the <code>POPS</code> folder of your file server, and you're good.</p><div class='title'><b>Multi-Disc Controls</b></div><p>There are button commands used for multi-disc games to simulate opening the disc tray, inserting a different disc, and closing the tray.

| June 19, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Lately I have revisited the Playstation 2, my favorite console of all time. I played the PS2 for hours and hours during college, made some amazing friends through playing games, and have amazing memories of those times. So, I wanted to relive those memories as well as return to a time when video games began evolving into something with more complexity, both for story and gameplay.</p><p>I wanted to return to the PS2 in the same way I've come back to other retro consoles thanks to the <a href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket" title="/analogue-pocket">Analogue Pocket</a>. I wanted to have a significant library of games that could easily be stored and sifted through digitally, as well as having them look their best on a modern TV. The PS2 is also backwards compatible with Playstation 1 games, so I wanted to be able to play those too. After messing around with things for about a month, I finally have everything set up.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The overall set up isn't too complicated, but it has a bunch of parts required for everything to work together. To quickly explain, I'm using a memory card with Free McBoot on an original Playstation 2 slim to run Open PS2 Loader. I have a Raspberry Pi acting a network file server that OPL is connecting to in order to load games. I have a 4tb hard drive connected to the Raspberry Pi where all of the games are stored. And, the PS2 is using component video cables connected to an OSSC to digitize the video and send it to my modern TV.</p><p>All of this was inspired by another one of Tito's YouTube videos: <br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8</a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 2</b></div><p>At the center of the entire set up is an actual Playstation 2. None of this entire process modifies the original console whatsoever. Everything extra can be unplugged from the Playstation 2, and it'll be the same as it was 20 years ago.</p><p>My original Playstation 2 Slim is 10,000km away back in the United States, so I bought a Japanese Slim from Yahoo Auctions. For the best possible compatibility, people had recommended the original Slim release, so I bought a SCPH-70000 model. It was really cheap at only 3000yen, and it came with the vertical stand and a few games.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In later revisions of the Playstation Slim, they moved Playstation 1 processing into software rather than hardware. They also removed legacy hard drive support, which isn't even available for the Slim.</p><div class='title'><b>Free McBoot Memory Card</b></div><p>In order for any of this to work, we need access to the Playstation 2's file system and be able to run unofficial applications. In particular, we need to be able to run <b>Open PS2 Loader</b>. Creating your own Free McBoot memory card from complete scratch has a lot of steps, but these days, you can easily buy a pre-built Free McBoot memory card from Amazon. I bought one from Amazon JP for only 1500yen.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Official Playstation 2 memory cards have the Magic Gate branding on them, which acts like a Seal of Approval ensuring that all games are compatible with it. This card doesn't have such approval and it's also 64mb compared to the official 8mb limit. Because of this, some games don't like it. We Love Katamari in particular has some saving problems.</p><p>One really nice thing about this card is that it came with absolutely everything installed on it. It already had OPL, all of the retro game emulators, and other necessary applications.</p><div class='title'><b>MemCard Pro2</b></div><p>Going one step further, 8bitmods released a device called the MemCard Pro2, which they restocked a month or two after my initial setup was complete. It is advertised as the "the last memory card you'll ever need," and with this, I no longer need a dedicated memory card with Free McBoot. Although, having an extra card with Free McBoot is handy when moving files around from Memory Card to Memory Card.</p><p>All of the details for the Memcard Pro2 are discussed in another post: <a href="/old/v7/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="/memcard-pro2-for-ps2">/memcard-pro2-for-ps2</a></p><div class='title'><b>Raspberry Pi 3 w/ SMB Share</b></div><p>While the hardware center is the Playstation 2 itself, the software center is the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi acts as a File Server and it is directly connected to the PS2 using an ethernet cable. </p><p>I didn't own a Raspberry Pi, so I went to Yahoo Auctions again to find a cheap one. I found a Raspberry Pi 3 with heatsinks installed and an AC adapter for 4000yen. Good deal!  Later, I bought an acrylic case with a fan for only $4 from AliExpress. Also, I had an extra LCD Monitor and a extra keyboard, so I'm using those with it, too.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In order to set up the SMB Share, you need to flash an SD card with the Playstation SMB Share.

This happens every time the Raspberry Pi boots up. The default username is <code>pi</code> and the default password is <code>raspberry</code>. With everything set up, you'll need IP information for OPL's connection. Type in <code>ifconfig</code> and you'll be given the network data.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" /></a></p><p><pre>inet 192.168.2.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255</pre></p><p>This is the line that we care about. The Pi's IP address is <code>192.168.2.1</code>. To turn off the Raspberry Pi, type <code>sudo shutdown -h now</code>. It will shutdown, but then you'll need to unplug it. There's no actual on/off switch.</p><p><b>Note:</b> the Raspberry Pi doesn't like to plug and play. Anything you have plugged in on start up, it will auto mount, but if you plug in something after it has already been turned on, you need to manually mount the device, whether it's a keyboard, a monitor, or a usb drive. Plug in everything before you give it power for best results.</p><div class='title'><b>USB Drive</b></div><p>The SMB Server expects a USB device plugged in the Raspberry Pi to serve files from, and the device must be formatted exFat. </p><p>Every one recommends to use a USB Flash Drive, but standard USB Flash Drives aren't able to scale. They're fine if you want to have a couple of games, but I want to have a large library of games. Modern USB hard drives are pretty big. In fact, I have a few 5tb SSD drives for backing up files. But these are powered through USB. The Raspberry Pi uses a measly amount of power so it can't power anything through USB.</p><p>I had an older 4tb Western Digital hard drive with an actual hard disk, not a solid state or a flash drive. This drive has its own power connection separate from USB. By plugging this in and turning it on before powering on the Raspberry Pi, it works just like any other USB storage device. </p><div class='title'><b>Games and OPL Manager</b></div><p>The physical chain between the Playstation 2 and the games is complete, but there are two more steps. First off, we need some games. You can illegally download games for several different places online. These files come in two different flavors: ISOs and bin/cue files. </p><p><b>Open PS2 Loader</b> is the UI application used on the Playstation 2 to select and run these files, so they need to be in a particular format and have a particular file naming scheme. The USB Drive also needs to be in a particular file structure for OPL to find the games.</p><p><b>OPL Manager</b> is a PC program that will do all of this for us. You can <a href="https://oplmanager.com/site/" title="https://oplmanager.com/site/">download it here</a> or just search on Google if the location changed.</p><p>When OPL Manager first starts, it will ask for a base location. For me, I use a temp location on my USB drive for a few reasons. (One) OPL Manager can take a while to load if there are a lot of games at the location. So, when using a temp location it only needs to load the few games I'm working with at the time. Likewise, these games take up a LOT of space, so (Two) I don't want to process them locally and copy them later. This takes up a lot of space on my local computer, and takes time copying to the hard drive later. I want to work with everything on the drive, and move files around on the drive after.</p><p>Once a base location is selected, it will create all of the folders OPL requires. PS2 games will primarily go in the <code>DVD</code> folder. The <code>CD</code> folder is also for PS2 games that use CD format rather than DVD. This only matters when a game uses other tracks on the disk for audio. I don't think any PS2 game does this. All notable and modern games have their music baked into the game code, so the <code>CD</code> folder can be ignored.</p><p>There are a few other interesting folders, particular <code>THM</code>, <code>ART</code>, and <code>CFG</code>. For a further description of these folders, please read my full OPL load out post: <a href="/old/v7/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="/opl-theme-and-loadout">/opl-theme-and-loadout</a></p><p>OPL only wants games in the ISO format, so you need to convert CD/Bin games to ISO. OPL Manager can do this. Choose <code>Disc/Convert to ISO</code> under Tools, and select files from there.</p><p>Also, OPL wants a particular file format. OPL Manager will mark all the illegal filenames for you and ask you to change them. File names should start with the game's disc id, should not contain certain invalid characters, and should also not be longer than 31 characters. OPL Manager will help you make sure all of this stuff is correct.</p><p>Once all of the games are converted, I copy them into the main location and they are ready.</p><div class='title'><b>Open PS2 Loader</b></div><p>With the games ready, it's time for the Playstation 2 to find them. The USB Drive is plugged into the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is turned on and the server is running. Now, the Playstation 2 can be turned on. With the Free McBoot memory card also plugged in, Open PS2 Loader, or OPL is available from the menu. Select it, and OPL will open.</p><p>When it first boots up, there will be no games. There's a few things OPL does by default that we'll change later, but the first thing we'll need to do is configure the Network Settings so OPL can find the file server.</p><p>Hit <code>start</code> to bring up OPL settings, go to Network Config, and here is where we will enter the IP information from the Raspberry Pi we received from several steps before.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For the SMB Server, the PI's IP address was <code>192.168.2.1</code>, and the "Share" folder's name is <code>share</code>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Originally, my PS2's IP address was <code>192.168.0.10</code>, but I changed it to <code>192.168.2.10</code> to have the same LAN address as the Raspberry Pi. It's not necessary for OPL to work, but it is necessary for POPS to work with Playstation 1 games. Please read the <a href="/old/v7/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl">POPS</a> post for more details.</p><p>Overall, OPL will serve PS2 games from 3 locations: the USB drive, the hard drive, and the ethernet port. By default, it won't automatically connect to these locations. You need to hit the Circle button to connect manually. Also, the hard drive is selected by default. All of this can be changed in the OPL Setting menu.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By default, I am displaying the Ethernet games on Start Up. Since we're not using the USB Drive and Hard Drive for games, nor are we using any Applications, I disable all 3 of these options in the menu. And for both Ethernet games and Playstation games, I have OPL connecting to these sources automatically on start up.  Now, when OPL opens all of my Playstation 2 games will be shown immediately.</p><p><b>Note:</b> I'm using OPL Anniversary Edition which has Playstation as a menu display. The latest versions of OPL have removed the Playstation menu and force everything to be run from the Applications menu for better compatibility.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 1 Games</b></div><p>We can also run Playstation 1 games using OPL.

The video game generation of the Playstation 2 was the final generation to output analog video by default. HDMI became the standard for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and now everything is HDMI. Without any additional modification, Component video is the highest quality available for the PS2.
