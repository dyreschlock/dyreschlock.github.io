Using original hardware, the best way to do this is using  OPL.</p><p><b>Open PS2 Loader</b>, or OPL, is an interface installed on a PS2 memory card using Free McBoot OS.

To keep track of everything, I put all the entries in a database.

Overall, the calculation method are still based on Gamepress's <a href="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet" title="https://gamepress.gg/pokemongo/comprehensive-dps-spreadsheet">Comprehensive DPS Spreadsheet</a>, but now I'm pulling my data from Poke_Miner's <a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters">Game Master</a> file, and also updated the UI to be more visually appealing and understandable.</p><p class='img'><p class="img"><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter"><b>List of General Raid Counters</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/220906_pokemon/IMG_0744.webp" /></a></p></p><p>In addition, there are two others pages. </p><p><b><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/custom">Personal Raid Counter List</a></b> —  I made a page that uses Pokemon in my game to determine whether or not I can defeat the raid boss using just my two accounts. It's not up to date. </p><p><b><a href="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top" title="/apps/pokemon/raidcounter/top">Top Counters per Pokemon Type</a></b> —  Another page compares Pokemon of each type against a generic Arceus to see which is strongest within each type, and overall. It's up to date, but I haven't focused on readability.</p><div class='title'><b>Purpose</b></div><p>The purpose of these pages is to determine which Pokemon are the strongest against Pokemon that appear as raid bosses. It's very helpful to understand which Pokemon are worth catching and leveling to take down these bosses easily. While they almost always can't be defeated with just one person, every bit helps to defeat them with the fewest amount of people as you can.</p><p>Many sites that focus of Pokemon Go offer lists of the best pokemon, but never with enough detail to understand why they're the best and never on a single page with all bosses available in the game. Gamepress's DPS page is a great resource to see how much more powerful one pokemon is than another, but you have to manually search and filter everything.</p><p>Back in 2019, I first made this page. At the time, it was use the outputted data from Gamepress to create the page. Whenever there was an update, it would take a LOONGG time to redownload everything. So, last year, I rewrote the backend to do all the calculations itself using the same method as Gamepress. There's more information about here on the previous Project post: <b><a href="/old/v7/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old" title="/pokemon-go-raid-counters-old">Previous Post from 2022</a></b></p><div class='title'><b>Update</b></div><p>I liked my previous page, but it was unreadable to anyone else. Also, Gamepress almost never updates its backend data, which my page relied on.</p><p>As mentioned above, this update does two things.</p><p>First, I'm using Poke_Miner's <a href="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters" title="https://github.com/PokeMiners/game_masters">Game Master</a> file in Github to get my updates of Pokemon and Moves. This gets updated much more frequently when stuff changes in the game. (At least, I think it does.) Going along with this, all Pokemon data and moves are stored in the database, which makes it MUCH easier to change manually.</p><p>Second, I updated the UI. Only I could read it before. Now, I added labels on the numbers, and added images of the Pokemon and more colors, too. The Pokemon images really really pop, and make it super easy to scan the lists. I also added rounded corners, because Fuck yeah!</p><div class='title'><b>Further Updates</b></div><p>I'm not completely happy with a lot of the white-on-white text, so I need to fix that at some point.</p><p>Also, one of my users complained that he still didn't understand anything, so I was thinking of making pages for each raid boss that showed more detail, such as which moves were available, and pokemon types and weaknesses. I'll get to that at some point.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Fixing and Modding a PS4 Controller" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller">Fixing and Modding a PS4 Controller</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Some of the other inputs seemed sticky, too. Searching for troubleshooting methods online, one video suggested taking the controller apart to give it a good clean.</p><p>I ran through the cleaning procedure, but it was still broken. Such an annoying shame. However, the video mentioned that the button membranes or the button cable ribbon could be damaged. They were pretty cheap on Amazon! Only $3 for replacement membranes and $5 for a new cable ribbon.</p><div class='title'><b>Fixing</b></div><p>They arrived pretty quickly, so I ran a stream where I tried to fix my controller.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aSA6RM1V_jI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Success!  I was really surprised that it worked so flawlessly so easily. These controllers cost $60 new, so I think it's pretty amazing how a simple $5 part could completely fix it. I wonder how many people throw their controller away or sell it as junk online just because of a problem that a simple $3 or $5 part could fix.</p><p>So, fixing this thing was easy. What else could we do?</p><div class='title'><b>Modding</b></div><p>Taking out the buttons is extraordinary simple. They're just plastic pieces siting in a plastic shell. The rubber membranes and cable ribbon underneath do the real work of detecting the button presses.

There have been a few revisions over the years. Of course, I knew this from having to buy the correct button cable film from before, and also noticed that the trigger membranes were different. But, I didn't pay attention when buying the buttons.</p><p>Although the buttons are nearly identical across all revisions, the R2 and L2 triggers are not the same.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3616_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_3617_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>In my earlier revision of the controller, the tension and knock back is caused by a spring loaded wire that sits in a pathway on the inner left side of the button.

Also, the touch pad and home button are also black. It wasn't a complete conversion to blue.</p><div class='title'><b>Modding, again</b></div><p>Finding a complete set of buttons for my controller wasn't easy, but they did exist on AliExpress. And for only $3.  There was no way I was going to find a set of buttons with the exact Blue color, but I could find a full set of White buttons that matched the color of the controller. In the end, only a few buttons could be blue and they would really stand out. :)</p><p>Once again, I streamed the process.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0PAGyqHwjAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>..and once again not everything was perfect. The white of the buttons was not the exact same color white as the controller. It was more of a warm white, rather than a slate white. Also, the R2 and L2 buttons were closer, but not exact, so they could not be used. R1 and L1 were also wrong. Replacing the touch pad is more involved than it initially looked, too.</p><p>So many problems, but it wasn't all a waste.  The Home, Share, and Options are the same across all model of controllers, so they fit. And the slight difference in color isn't TOO noticeable.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230910_ps4/IMG_4623_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While it's not a perfect match, I think it looks better than before. :)</p><p>I like the idea of the face buttons and sticks popping out from the contrast and all the secondary buttons fading into the color of the controller.</p><div class='title'><b>Continuing…</b></div><p>For now, I'm going to call this closed. It'll take a bit of searching to try and find the exact colors I want for my model of controller.  More money, more time, more hassle. It's 90% of the way there, and that's good enough.</p><p>The main goal was fixing the controller in the first place, and even more so, I now have an excellent controller to use for the Switch. I bought an 8bitdo wireless adapter for the modded Playstation Classic, which I had given up on. Using it on the Switch instead, the PS4 controller works amazing. It is a far more comfortable controller to use than the Joy-cons.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Analogue Pocket - Curated Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/analogue-pocket-curated-games">Analogue Pocket - Curated Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Over the years, I have amassed quite a collection, and I've always wanted a good way of keeping track of what I have. </p><p>I've made some rudimentary webpages before, but I finally found some inspiration to put together a visual database of my games collection.</p><p><a href="/apps/games" title="/apps/games"><b>My Games Collection / Database</b></a></p><p class='img'><a href="/apps/games" title="/apps/games"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230504_games/IMG_2096.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230504_games/IMG_2096.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230504_games/IMG_2096.webp" /></a></p><p>By visiting the above link, you can view lists of all the games I have in my collection. You can click on each Console and Handheld to see a list of all individual games. You can also click on Condition and Region to filter results.</p><p>Inspiration for the layout came from prolific Giant Bomb community member, Brad Lynch, when he <a href="https://twitter.com/MarinoV1/status/1651677046383210515" title="https://twitter.com/MarinoV1/status/1651677046383210515">tweeted</a> screenshots of spreadsheets cataloguing his own collection. I instantly loved his layout.</p><p>Something that really puzzled me for a long time was how to include Digital games into my collection. Obviously some games are so incredibly simple, should they be included? 10 years ago, I think that was a difficult question to consider, but now? You can buy every games available on the platform digitally whether it's a full AAA release, indie release, or a simple game release. Using Digital as a condition type is perfect.</p><p>Going a step further, I could also use region to narrow down the version of the game. Including other information, such as Publisher, Developer, and Release Date seemed like a lot of data entry, but it didn't really take all that long to do. I've always been curious which are the most common developer and publishers among my games.</p><p>Unfortunately, these are only all of the games I have with me in Japan. The bulk of my collection is back in America and I won't have access to catalogue it until I return to visit.</p><p>But, overall, I'm quite happy. Another project marked off of the bucket list as I closed out the the oldest open bug case in my GitHub. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pocket Camera with Zoom Lens" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens">Pocket Camera with Zoom Lens</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This takes all of the original hardware of the GameBoy Camera and puts it into a shell that you can attach actual Camera lens. You can read more about here: <a href="/old/v7/gameboy-camera-plus" title="/gameboy-camera-plus">/gameboy-camera-plus</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230409_gameboy_camera/IMG_1665_t.webp" /></p><p>Attached to the Pocket Camera Plus, I'm using a pretty generic and bare bones Zoom lens. I just bought whatever was cheapest on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">Amazon</a>. It has manually focus, zoom, and aperture, and has a focus length of 6mm up to 60mm. I guess that means it has a 10x zoom. Each of the rings has a pin used for movement, but these pins can be screwed in to keep the current setting.</p><p>In addition to the manual settings of the lens, the GameBoy Camera game has a Contrast and Brightness setting. Contrast is very important to reduce the harsh lights and darks coming into the camera. There is some automatic brightness control that the camera already does. This makes the manual aperture nearly useless. And even the digital brightness settings in the game can get overridden by the software trying to autocorrect the brightness.</p><p>For the following photos, I really only used the manual Zoom and Focus, and digital Contrast when taking photos.</p><p>Anyway, with my Pocket Camera and regular Camera, I went around town throughout the weekend and tested it out.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakurano Park <span class='ja'>桜野公園</span></b></div><p>It's Spring in Takayama, so the Cherry Blossoms are in full boom. One of the best places to view cherry blossoms in Takayama is northwest of the main town. On the way to Kokufu, Sakurano Park is off to the side of the highway on the other side of the river. It's the perfect place to have a picnic on a warm Spring afternoon while viewing the cherry blossoms. (Although, this Spring has been freezing with the occasional snow)</p><p>I took some photos in late evening as the sun was setting.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div

incredible amount of flexibility when taking photos. No matter how close or how far away from the subject, the zoom allows you to frame the photo and the focus allows you to get all of the detail. The sensor itself is still primitive by only allowing 4 colors, but you can still get a ton of clarity.</p><p>Of course, photos are best taken when the subject is clearly light. If there is no strong light source, then it can be hard to squeeze out detail. 4 colors can only do so much.</p><div class='title'><b>Shiroyama Park <span class='ja'>城山公園</span></b></div><p>The next day, I went to Shiroyama Park downtown and took a few more photos.

| April 7, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Back in February, people began circulating a video about a mod for the GameBoy Camera. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnSb0cRK9xI" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnSb0cRK9xI">Macho Nacho made a video</a> about how you could take apart your GameBoy camera, and put it into a new shell created by 2BitToy. This shell used a CS mount ring, which would allow you to attach any CS mount camera lens to the GameBoy camera. People have made GameBoy Camera mods before. But, this was the first non-destructive, compact, and stable modification made easily available.</p><p>Here's the website detailing the mod: <a href="https://2bittoy.carrd.co/" title="https://2bittoy.carrd.co/">https://2bittoy.carrd.co/</a></p><p>It looked really simple and it wasn't too expensive. The Analogue Pocket has recently revived my interest in retro handheld accessories, so I ordered all of the parts and let things slowly arrive over time. Now that it's Spring Break, it's time to put everything together!</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1412_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was really surprised how fast and easy it came together. You can look through the pictures below to see how I assembled everything together. Macho Nacho's video also shows the step-by-step process of putting together the camera.</p><p><b>One thing to note!</b> In Macho Nacho's video, he doesn't recommend using this mod with the Analogue Pocket. However, he's using Version 1 of the 3D printed shell. When I purchased the parts, Shapeways had Version 2. Version 2 is a little fatter than the original.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1407_t.webp" /></a></p><p>With the whole thing assembled, it is really tight when fitting it into the cartridge slot of the Analogue Pocket. This may or may not be a problem in itself, BUT there is no movement of the cartridge after it's inserted. It is very solid. That said, when actually taking pictures, I'm not going to hold it like a GameBoy. I plan on holding it in the middle to balance all of the weight.</p><div class='title'><b>Assembly</b></div><p>There are 3 overall steps required to make this once you've gathered all of the parts: (1) taking apart a GameBoy Camera, (2) glueing the CS mount ring and IR filter, and (3) putting everything together. I let the Epoxy sit overnight to harden, but otherwise, it took me no longer than an hour to do everything. It was really fast.</p><p>I would recommend glueing the CS mount ring and IR filter first. Then, the disassembly and assembly can be done together very quickly.</p><div class='title'><b>Required Parts and Tools for Building</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_0739_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Macho Nacho's video details all of the parts and tools you'll need, but I'll reiterate them here for comparison.</p><p>There are 5 main set of parts you'll need to create the Camera Plus.</p><p>1. You'll need an original <b>GameBoy Camera</b>. You'll take this apart and use the insides. If you don't already have one, you'll have to search on eBay for one. I got one from Yahoo Auctions for 2930<span class='ja'>円</span> with shipping.</p><p>2. You'll need a set of <b>3D printed plastic components</b> to create the new shell for the Camera. You can print them yourself using the files from 2BitToy's website. Or, you can buy printed ones from ShapeWays. There are 4 total: The front and back shell, the sensor mount, and the IR filter mount. With shipping to Japan, this was $92.83<br/><a href="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy" title="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy">https://www.shapeways.com/shops/2bittoy</a></p><p>3. This is optional, but it's probably worth it. You'll need a <b>10mm x 1.0mm IR Filter</b>. Linked below is the one that I purchased. It was 1200<span class='ja'>円</span>.<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B07GFMMK5V</a></p><p>4. You'll need a <b>5mm CS Mount Lens ring</b>. This will be glued to the back shell and used to screw in the lens. It was 816<span class='ja'>円</span><br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B01N0XBD6A</a></p><p>5. Lastly, you'll need a <b>CS Mount Zoom Lens</b>. This is the one I purchased. Only 2660<span class='ja'>円</span>!<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9">https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B07H2VTQX9</a></p><p>Altogether, the materials cost 7606<span class='ja'>円</span> and $92.83, a total of about $150. Actually, I suppose this isn't so cheap after all. Although, your mileage may vary depending on how cheap you can get a GameBoy Camera and Lens.</p><div class='title'><b>Required Tools</b></div><p>You'll also need a few totals to disassemble the GameBoy Camera and glue some parts together. This adds a little bit more to the grand total.</p><p>1. You probably already have a <b>Phillips screwdriver</b>, but you need to have one fine enough to remove small screws. </p><p>2. You'll also need <b>Epoxy</b> to glue the Lens ring to the back shell and the IR filter to its mount. You may already have this, but it's easy to buy at your local hardware store. You can see the brand I purchased from my photos.</p><p>3. Something you probably don't have is a <b>Tri-point screwdriver</b>. Old Nintendo products used screws with three divots in them, rather than a flat-head or a Phillips. I did not already have this. They are readily available on Amazon, though. I bought the following one.<br/><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS">https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B0162MMGSS</a></p><div class='title'><b>Photo Results</b></div><p>It is uncanny how much definition and versatility this modification adds to the GameBoy. You can take a picture from across the room by zooming in and focusing using the dials on the lens.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1419_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230401_gameboy_camera/IMG_1420_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I can't wait to take this thing out in the field and take some photos.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Analogue Pocket Extras" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pocket-extras">Analogue Pocket Extras</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The most visible front-facing part of these cores is the Platform information and image.

Usually these images are available, and it only takes 5 minutes to make the image. But, for some Arcade games, those images can be hard to find in good quality. Often too, if I do get a good image, the original artwork looks lame.</p><p>Recently, I've been recreating many of these images using key art from officially marketing at the time. I put the image on the canvas and try to make it fit. Often I need to blend things around, move the title and other things in the background for a good composition.

Thus, I created a "Home" image set to complement my Arcade images. Home would include cores for Consoles, Handhelds, and Computers. Technically, handhelds aren't specifically made for the home, but I think this monicker is pretty descriptive.</p><p>I really liked <a href="https://github.com/terminator2k2/Analogue-Pocket-Core-Art" title="https://github.com/terminator2k2/Analogue-Pocket-Core-Art">Terminator2k2</a>'s Image set which just had the logos of the systems, but I needed to do something else to distinguish my set. I got the idea when I started looking at old ads for consoles that showed off their game libraries. Also on Twitter, many people like to post a smattering or a pile of game boxes when they have a large haul from a shopping spree. I thought that I should try and do that. Games are the most important thing for any console or handheld after all. They should be displayed front and center.</p><p>I already had a bunch of box art downloaded thanks to my <a href="/old/v7/pocket-utils" title="/pocket-utils">Pocket Utils</a> project, so I made a collage of them in photoshop, added some perspective, shrunk down to the correct size, and color-corrected some things to make it look alright in grayscale.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/snes.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/ng.png" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/nes.png" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/pocket-platform-images/main/pics/home/genesis.png" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Overall, I think they turned out pretty good.

The MiSTer is another FPGA device that has been around much longer than the Analogue Pocket, and there are hundreds of cores that have been created. All cores available for the Analogue Pocket today are ports of these cores. Because of this, it's easy to see a roadmap for future cores to be released on the Pocket. In particular, core developers <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jotego/posts" title="https://www.patreon.com/jotego/posts">Jotego</a> and <a href="https://github.com/opengateware" title="https://github.com/opengateware">Open Gateware</a> (aka Boogerman) have a wealth of cores they plan to bring to the Pocket.</p><p>I've worked ahead quite a bit so when new cores are released, I don't have to spend that afternoon making the image.

| October 13, 2022 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the last month, the Analogue Pocket has continued to be an absolute monster. The Sega Genesis is now available. The Nintendo Entertainment System is now available. Sega GameGear is available, too. And there have been many cores of 1980s Arcade games released, too.</p><p>It's starting to get unwieldily, so I've created a collection of programs to help me organize and process games so they can be played on the Pocket.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils">https://github.com/dyreschlock/pocket-utils</a></p><p>I've been working on this pretty solidly for the past three weeks, and I think it's finally feature finished. The GitHub repository has straight forward information of how each process is set up and what exactly each process does. But, overall…</p><p>Pocket Utils is a collection of scripts and programs that do several things, including the following: (1) Process MRA files and Create Arcade Roms, (2) Create Library Images for sorted Games, and (3) Update Platform information for cores.</p><div class='title'><b>Process MRA Files</b></div><p>The Multi-Arcade Machine Emulator, or MAME, on computer standardized how to emulate arcade games. When ripping games from their original boards, each component had their own file, and everything was put together in a zip file. </p><p>FPGA emulation of arcade games doesn't like this. The chip wants direct read access to the data it wants and unzipping a file in memory is extra useless overhead. Thus, the idea of a MRA file was introduced. A MRA file contains specific instructions on how each piece of the arcade board can be assembled into a single ROM file. This file is not compressed and allow free access to all the data the FPGA wants. </p><p>A separate program is required to process these MRA files, though. I use this <a href="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c" title="https://github.com/nullobject/mra-tools-c">MRA Tool</a> found in NullObject's GitHub. When an arcade core is released for the Analogue Pocket, it'll come with MRA files to create ROMs from ZIP files of arcade components. You must get the arcade ROM zips, process the MRA file in the program giving it the zip files, and then place the generated ROM into the core's folder on the Analogue Pocket.</p><p>There are lots of steps to getting this to work, and many arcade cores released for the Analogue Pocket play multiple games. Some releases come with 10 or more games. In fact, arcade systems like Capcom CPS1 and CPS2 have as many as 300 variants of their games. Doing all of this manually is not feasible.</p><p>This program solves this problem.</p><p>Put all of your MRA files in the to-be-processed directory. Run the program. It'll attempt to download any and all ZIP files required to make the arcade rom, and store them locally. If the Arcade ROM is successfully generated, it'll copy it to the correct directory on the Pocket, and also copy the MRA file to the Pocket, too.</p><p>If it can't find the ZIP files online, you can manually search for them and put them in your local store. If a ROM was already generated, it'll copy over the MRA file anyway. If the MRA file is already there, it'll copy it to a duplicate directory.</p><p>With Standard games, everything works really well and there are almost never any problems. Problems usually only come up when trying to generate bootlegs or hacks of roms. Those often require extra steps.</p><div class='title'><b>Create Library Images</b></div><p>One of the most appealing features of the Analogue Pocket is the Library feature. </p><p>Something I've never liked about using emulators is having to choose the games I want to play from a list. It's so sterile and clinical. The Super Nintendo Mini was so amazing because of its visual presentation. You had a line games presented with their box art. And you could visually choose the game you wanted to play by selecting that box art.</p><p>The Library feature of the Analogue Pocket was just that. It gave you a visual list of all your games to select from. Further still, you could organize all of your games in Playlists. This was promised in Analogue's Tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888" title="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888">Analogue OS</a>.</p><p>By default, the Analogue Pocket has an internal list of game data but it doesn't have an images. Early on, you could download an image pack that gave you all the title screens for every game. But I don't want title screens. I want box arts.</p><p>It took a little while to figure out, but the Analogue Pocket uses a CRC hash of the file to reference which image is uses in the Library. If you have a correctly sized PNG file, you can run it through <a href="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter" title="https://github.com/DerTolleEmil/AnaloguePocketLibraryImageConverter">DerTolleEmil</a>'s Image Converter and it'll give you a BIN file. Put this bin file in the correct folder named with the CRC hash, and it'll use this image in the Library.</p><p>So, my program goes a bit further with it.</p><p>In each of the folders for Consoles and Handhelds on the Analogue Pocket, I have the ROMs that I like sorted into genre folders. My initial "CreatePocketEntries" program will collect all of these games in my database. "CreateLibraryImages" will look at every game in my database and attempt to download the box art image from <a href="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails" title="https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails">LibRetro</a> on Github. With this image, my program will resize it to the correct dimensions for the Pocket, convert the PNG image to BIN, name it correctly, and copy the file to the System folder on the Pocket.</p><p>Now, when using the Library, the image matches the box art. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/221013_pocket/IMG_3099_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Update Platform Information</b></div><p>Another thing that I collect in my database is Core information.</p><p>When a user chooses a core from the openFPGA menu on the Pocket, it lists certain information about itself, such as when the console or handheld was original released, who was the manufacture, and also the name and category of the core, too. All core developers are very particular about the accurate representation of the consoles, games, and their code, so this information is usually correct, but sometime it is not to avoid copyright and trademark violations.</p><p>In the database, it's easy for me to edit this information and also collect all the information into categories. My program will rewrite all of the information in the Platforms directory with what I have in my database. </p><p>Additionally, it'll create Platform Images using agg23's <a href="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process" title="https://github.com/agg23/Analogue-Pocket-Image-Process">Platform Image Creator</a>. Any new images that I've made and placed in the processing directory will be converted and copied over.</p><div class='title'><b>Run the Updater</b></div><p>There is also a simple shell script that runs <a href="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility" title="https://github.com/mattpannella/pocket-updater-utility">Matt Pannella</a>'s command line program with all of the settings that I like.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>I use this stuff pretty often when new cores and new features are released, so there continue to be more updates. When Playlists eventually come to the Pocket, I'll have a new program to make those. I'm also working on another program that will make a list of games I have in my "unsorted" directories for each core.</p><p>The Pocket continues to be one of the absolute best gaming devices made, and being able to make all this stuff to organize games has gotten back into programming on the side. It's been pretty great. :)<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/game-projects/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/game-projects">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
