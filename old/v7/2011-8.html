| August 31, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The night before I moved into my new apartment, Fishy, Chaos and I took a stroll down State St, and had dinner at The Osaka House to celebrate my night of homelessness.  There was a point where I had been to every sushi restaurant in Madison, but in the last 4 years several new places have emerged. The Osaka House poised itself on being new, but after our visit it is merely a satellite restaurant of Edo Restaurant.  Edo is located in Monona, and is where my coworkers and I go for sushi because it's the closest.  Osaka House had the same new menus that Edo has.  They even said 'Edo Restaurant' on the cover.  But anyway, this is all good because Edo Restaurant is quite delicious.</p><p>I ordered a bunch of rolls that sounded delicious, and I noticed a super cheap roll under the vegetarian options:  Asparagus Sushi, $3.  Hell, how could I pass that up.  Out of the whole night, I would say this roll was the stand out for me.  Though, not because it  was better tasting than anything else I had, but because I had no expectations for it.  I mean, $3 and purely vegetarian?  How good could it be?</p><p>But it was surprisingly good, and incredibly simple.  Just a single Asparagus stalk in rice.  Fuck, I could do that.  I've tried making sushi before, with disappointing results, but how could I mess this one up?</p><p>Now that I'm settled into my new place, I took a look at a few recipes online, and found the following recipe for preparing Asparagus (&lt;a href="http://embitca.hubpages.com/hub/How-to-Cook-Asparagus"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) and sticky rice (&lt;a href="http://www.mahalo.com/how-to-make-perfect-sushi-rice/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).  Make the two separate, and then combine.</p><p>Tonight, I invited two of my friends over, Kate and Fishy, and attempted to make them dinner.  So, here's what I did, and here's what I learned:</p><div class='title'><b>Asparagus Sushi Recipe</b></div><p>Here are all the ingredients you'll need</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6260.webp"  /></p><p>Black Pepper, Salt (I used Garlic Salt), Rice Vinegar, Balsamic Vinegar, Sugar (I used Honey), Olive Oil, Asparagus, Dried Seaweed (aka Nori), and Rice.</p><div class='title'><b>1) Make Rice</b></div><p>The first thing I did was make 2 cups of rice, because, out of all the steps, that takes the longest.  I have a rice cooker specifically for this task, but you can make the rice however you want.  Just make sure to <b>wash and clean</b> your rice, or else all the dust and dirt will get baked in and you lose a lot of flavor.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6258.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>2) Prepare Asparagus</b></div><p>I laid out all my Asparagus on a flat baking pan.  I covered the pan with some Aluminum Foil to save me from some extra clean up down the road.  On top of the Asparagus, I drizzled some <b>Olive Oil</b>, doing my best to coat the veggies.  Next, I did the same with a little bit of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  Followed by some <b>Black Pepper</b>.  And concluding with some <b>Balsamic Vinegar</b>.  With all the seasoning scattered on top, I started tossing all the Asparagus together to mix all the ingredients and to properly coat everything.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6261.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>3) Roast Asparagus</b></div><p>Rather than steam or pan fry the Asparagus, I went with the Roasting route as that recipe suggests.  I preheated the over to 400, and dumped the whole pan inside.  After a while they start to simmer and smell really really good.  After 10 minutes, I took a single piece and tried it.  Not quite finished.  We decided to leave them in there another 5 or 7 minutes. We probably should have left it in there a little longer than that, but it turned out alright.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6264.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>4) Sticky Rice Mixture</b></div><p>While the Asparagus were baking, I made the mixture for the sticky rice.  In the little pot, I combined the 1/4 cup of <b>Rice Vinegar</b>, 1/4 cup of <b>Honey</b>, and 2 tbsp of <b>Garlic Salt</b>.  I didn't measure any of this, I just eye-balled it.  I turned on the stove to #4, which heated the mixture really fast.  The recipe says to mix everything until the powder has dissolved in the liquids, and then you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6262.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>5) Sticky Rice</b></div><p>With the mixture complete, simply add it to the rice, and mix mix mix.  While the White Rice is naturally very sticky, this mixture will start breaking it up a bit, and make the rice much more manageable, and delicious.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6263.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>6) Combine!</b></div><p>Putting Sushi together is the easy, and the most fun part of this whole recipe.  The more challenging parts (to me) are correctly preparing everything to put inside the sushi.  To make sushi, start with the <b>Nori</b>, lay down the <b>rice</b>, put the <b>ingredients</b> on the rice, roll them together, and that's it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6265.webp"  /></p><p>Though, you might find that quite difficult just using your hands to place everything together.  The rice will stick to anything dry, so the trick is to constantly wet your hands.  You can have a bowl of water to dip your hands in, or I just use water from the tap.</p><p>Wet your hands, grab some rice, stick in on the Nori, and continue until you have a line of rice.  Place the ingredients in the center most portion of the rice.  With your hands, roll the Nori and completely surround the rice.  Roll it all the way around so you have a tube.  Surround the tub with the bamboo roller, and tighten it up.  Hold it for a couple seconds so the heat can penetrate through all the layers of the Nori, and fuse it together.  Then release, and you're done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6266.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110901_sushi/IMG_6267.webp"  /></p><p>With a super-sharp knife, you can segment the roll into individual pieces.  But my knife is somewhat dull right now, so we just chowed down on the rolls as is.</p><div class='title'><b>Lessons Learned, and solutions!</b></div><p>After eating that first roll, there were 2 problems...</p><p>The <b>first</b> problem was that you could hardly taste the asparagus.  If you notice that first image under combining, I only used 3 stalks in a roll.  The rice totally overpowered the sushi.  To solve this I used twice the amount of asparagus, and it turned out so much better.</p><p>The <b>second</b> problem was that I didn't clip the asparagus.  One step that I skipped from the Roasted Asparagus recipe was cutting off the fibrous wooden stem that cannot and should not be eaten.  The video made mention of the point between food and stem was the snapping point.  Hold on a stalk and break it with both hands.  Where it breaks is where you want it separated.</p><p>After solving these two problems, I thought they turned out delicious.  Though, I don't think my lady friends were impressed.  This isn't exactly gourmet food.  Plus, I don't have any furniture in my apartment, so we ate on my carpeted floor.  This was the <b>third</b> problem, I think.  Also, if I had dishes, then we could've made use of <b>soy sauce</b>.  Also, I was missing some <b>wasabi</b> and <b>ginger</b>.</p><p>But whatever.  This is some delicious food that was easy and quick to make.  Barring the 30-40 minutes it takes to make 2 cups of rice, everything else was about 20 minutes.  And most of the steps can be done concurrently, so once the rice is done, you can start rolling.  Though, you may want to wait 10 minutes for the rice to cool, or else you'll burn your fingers.</p><p>Also, going by this recipe, I yielded 7 rolls.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX Prime 2011" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-prime-2011">PAX Prime 2011</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| August 23, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The annual Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle is this weekend.  This has been creeping up on me.  After moving into a new apartment, the last few weeks have been busy and just flew by, and I almost forgot about this.</p><p>At the beginning of August, they released the panel schedule, and over the last few weeks, game studios have been issuing press releases on all the games they plan on having in the exhibition hall.  Everything seems to be coming together, and I'm definitely excited.</p><p>Here's some of the panels (and events) that I plan on attending...</p><p><b>1up Presents: Retronauts v. Your Fondest Memories</b> - Friday 3pm @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Although I don't listen to retronauts anymore, their live podcasts are always great.  Jeremy Parish and Chris Kohler have an incredible wealth of gaming knowledge, and they're joined by Jeff Green this year, which should add some extra humor to the mix.</p><p><b>Minecraft Adventure Update Q&A and Demo</b> - Friday 3pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch hosts a Q&A for the upcoming Minecraft 1.8 patch, and plays through a demo.</p><p><b>After Party w/ The Protomen</b> - Friday 8pm @ El Corazon<br/>An intimate after party with one of the best video game music groups!  Openers include Jonny Nero Action Hero, and Klopfenpop.  Hosted by Fangamer.</p><p><b>Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'</b> - Saturday 10:30am @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Though I'm not really fan of Destructoid people, Ashley and Anthony Burch, along with their father, form a hilarious sibling rivalry over specific games.</p><p><b>Irrational Games</b> - Saturday 2pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>It's been over one year that Irrational Games unveiled their upcoming title BioShock Infinite, the pseudo sequel/prequel to their 2007 hit game BioShock.  The panel is lead by Ken Levine as he discusses the development process, what we're seen already of BioShock Infinite, and they'll probably play through the E3 demo on stage.</p><p><b>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b> - Saturday 3:30pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>One of the biggest and most hyped games of this upcoming season is the new Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim.  Bethesda devs take the stage, and most likely will run through the QuakeCon demo on stage.  Super excited for this one.</p><p><b>Square Enix Presents...</b> - Saturday 7pm @ Pegasus Theatre<br/>Squaresoft is heading a panel as well, and they will be unveiling a brand new title.  This title is Airtight Games upcoming FPS from creative director Kim Swift (creator of Portal, and director of the Left 4 Dead games).  While I don't give a shit about Square anymore, I'm quite a fan of Kim Swift.  Can't wait to see what it is.</p><p><b>Minecraft Griefer Party</b> - Sunday 5:30pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch is tearing down the Minecraft booth and giving away pieces of it as souvenirs.</p><p>Nothing else really caught my eye.  It seemed like there were a lot more interesting panels at PAX East this year (<a href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced" title="/pax-east-panels-announced">reference</a>).  It's also annoying that there isn't a Chiptune showcase.</p><p>But that's fine.  My time at PAX is almost always spent in the exhibition rooms standing in lines waiting for games.  This year there is a huge amount of upcoming games I'm interested in and all of them plan to be at PAX.  These include <b>House of the Dead</b>, <b>Team ICO Collection</b>, <b>Elder Scrolls Skyrim</b>, and <b>Zelda Skyward Sword</b>.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml">this list</a>, there will also be indie game <b>Fez</b>, upcoming Suda 51 / James Gunn game <b>Lollipop Chainsaw</b>, <b>Batman Arkham City</b>, <b>Mass Effect 3</b>, Grasshopper published titles <b>Sine Mora</b> and <b>Black Knight Sword</b>, and Sony will have <b>Playstation Vita</b> units to demo too.  Mojaang (Minecraft) has a booth too!</p><p>It should be an amazing fun time.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Added stuff about Minecraft from their <a href="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/" title="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/">schedule</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Upcoming Music!" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/upcoming-music">Upcoming Music!</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I was only able to attend Friday night, but seeing The Chemical Brothers live was one of my all-time favorite concerts.</p><p>Here's the link for the full schedule:<br/><a href="http://lineup.northcoastfestival.com/events/2011/09/02/" title="http://lineup.northcoastfestival.com/events/2011/09/02/">http://lineup.northcoastfestival.com/events/2011/09/02/</a></p><p>This year, they have some pretty big names too, much more variety, and multiple after-parties scattered across the city.</p><p>Those are listed here:<br/><a href="http://do312.com/ncmfafterparties" title="http://do312.com/ncmfafterparties">http://do312.com/ncmfafterparties</a></p><p>With so much going on, it's a pretty good idea to make a schedule, so here's what I plan on doing from Friday to late late Sunday night:</p><div class='title'><b>Friday</b></div><p><b>5:30pm</b> - James Zabiela @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>7:30pm</b> - Wolfgang Gartner @ North Coast Stage<br/><b>8:30pm</b> - David Guetta @ North Coast Stage  (...i guess)<br/><b>10pm</b> - James Zabiela @ Sound-Bar</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday</b></div><p><b>2pm</b> - Felix Cartel @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>3pm</b> - Zeds Dead @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>4:30pm</b> - Big Gigantic @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>5:30pm</b> - Future Rock @ Groupon Stage<br/><b>7:15pm</b> - Carl Cox @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>8:45pm</b> - Fatboy Slim @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>10pm</b> - Andy Moor @ Vision</p><div class='title'><b>Sunday</b></div><p><b>1:30pm</b> - DJ Solo @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>5:30pm</b> - Little Dragon @ Groupon Stage <br/>(or) <b>6pm</b> - ATB @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>6:30pm</b> - Of Montreal @ North Coast Stage<br/>(or) <b>7pm</b> - Benny Benassi @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>8:30pm</b> - Bassnectar @ North Coast Stage<br/>(or) <b>8:30pm</b> - Thievery Corporation @ Red Bull Stage<br/><b>10pm</b> - Steve Bug, Ida Engberg, Woody McBride @ Transit<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (36)
