| May 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As a game collector, you eventually come across a game that you simply cannot find.  A game that's not necessary rare, but uncommon.  The only distinction between the two being demand.  This particular game for me is (was) Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.</p><p>DDR Party Collection was released in Dec 2003 as a follow-up and compliment to DDR Extreme.  The arcade version of DDR Extreme had so many songs that the home release couldn't contain them all and they released two games.  DDR Extreme had all the new original songs, plus some favorites.  While DDR Party Collection contained the bulk of the favorites and classics they couldn't pack into DDR Extreme.  It used the exact same engine as DDR Extreme, and had just as many songs!</p><p>We played this game a few times at DDR Nights in college, as Tony had a ROM copy, but I wished someday to own a legitimate copy.   Throughout my Study Abroad in Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  Throughout my yearly vacations to Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  I eventually gave up and decided to buy a copy off ebay, but they were no longer listed!  No one was selling.</p><p>It was <b>one year ago yesterday</b> that I finally found a copy.  My 6 year long quest had finally come to its end in Kumamoto.  And it was a fated encounter...</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto</b></div><p>After Dave and I visited Kagoshima, we traveled North to Kumamoto.  Kumamoto is Kyushu's central prefecture, and it's focal point is the gigantic castle in the dead center of town.  Dave and I were able to visit the castle, but only 30-40 minutes before it closed.  Afterward, we wondered what to do.</p><p>On my map, I had one location written down which was a Geo (video game store) not too far east of the Capitol.  We ventured down the castle hill, and made it to the train station.  We passed some delicious looking restaurants on the way there, but wanted to ensure we got on the train.  When we got to the train station, the train wasn't scheduled to arrive for another 20 or 30 minutes, so we backtracked to this interesting hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</p><div class='title'><b>Choboiyaki</b></div><p>This restaurant served Okonomiyaki, but it's not the type you would expect.  It was definitely prepared in a similar manner, but the pancake was HUGE.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp"  /></p><p>The radius of this pancake is about as large as the diameter should be.  She piled on the cabbage, and smashed it all down into form.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp"  /></p><p>The pancake was flipped over, folded, and cut up into servable pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp"  /></p><p>And like all Okonomiyaki, it was absolutely delicious.  Between her semi-decent english and my horrible Japanese, we were able to talk a little bit about what she was actually making...</p><p>Japan may look somewhat small, especially compared to the United States, but it is incredibly diverse.  As a country, Japan grew from isolation, and that isolation spread to its culture, and it culture is known for taking elements of other culture, assimilating them, and expanding on them.  So you get plenty of local cultural traits you won't find anywhere else.  And this especially applies to food.</p><p>This particular version of Okonomiyaki is only local to Kumamoto and is known as Choboiyaki.  At least I think that's what she said.  Here's a pic of the menu with the name on it: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp">Image!</a>.  Maybe it's just Choboyaki...  or Chobomiyaki, except the 'ya' fire kanji immediately follows 'chobo'.  I dunno...</p><div class='title'><b>Off to Geo</b></div><p>That stuff was delicious and unique, but it's off to the game store to kill time.  I'm sure Dave was somewhat bored with my over-attentive scrutiny of searching every single game they owned, so I didn't go through absolutely everything.  I searched PS2 games and found nothing.  I skimmed PS1, skimmed Saturn, searched Dreamcast, and that was pretty much it.  I couldn't quit find the Rhythm game section for PS2, but didn't want to bore Dave that much more.</p><p>Though, on my way out, Beatmania caught my eye.  "Hold on a second.." I said as I crotched down to take a look, and HOLY CRAP!  What do you know!  It just so happened that they had a copy of DDR Party Collection on the shelf.  I was pretty surprised, as I had never seen this game in the wild.  Though, I didn't get my hopes completely up, as in the past, I happened across a game on the shelf, and they ultimated didn't actually have it in stock.</p><p>I took the case to the counter as my only purchase.  They went around the corner to search through their PS2 games, and didn't seem to immediately find it.  The two girls came back to the counter to take a look at the case again and noticed something they had missed on first glance.  They went to the back and came back with this:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp"  /></p><p>Exclamation point!  Not only did they have a copy of the game, they had the limited edition release of the game that came with a dance pad, complete with bucket.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp"  /></p><p>I looked closer at the sales label (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp">pictured here</a>), and it had the sale date as Dec 11th, 2003.  Not only did they have this in their possesion, but it's been since RELEASE DAY!  It had waited for 6 1/2 years collecting dust and being constantly passed up but patrons until I came through the doors.  One of the games I've been searching for 6 years, and I found a release copy NEW.</p><p>This is fate.  I immediately bought it.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a bucket of DDR turned into a slight difficulty considering Dave and I packed VERY lightly for our trip.  I had no room for this thing in my luggage.  But how could I not keep this thing that I was destined to own!</p><p>Well, I don't need the crappy DDR pad.  So, I threw that in the trash.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp"  /></p><p>I stuff the bucket full of my dirty clothes</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp"  /></p><p>And doing so gave me plenty of room to store in my luggage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp"  /></p><p>Perfect!</p><p>And so my quest ends.  The game that took me the longest time to find was finally found.  (Actually, I guess that's not true, as I've been searching for a copy of Snatcher on Sega CD since the late 90s.)  With DDR Party in hand, my PS2 DDR Collection is complete.  I have all the games I want. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet " rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-ds-carrying-case-puppet">Nintendo DS Carrying Case / Puppet </a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 22, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Nintendo's new handheld, the Nintendo 3DS is set for release this Sunday.  And I've had one on preorder ever since they've announced the price and release date.  I wrote something a few weeks ago about how excited I was about it: <a href="/old/v7/nintendo-3ds" title="/nintendo-3ds">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=829</a>.  I wasn't excited for the 3D so much, as I was to finally have a second DS for trading of Pokemon.</p><p>This week, the gaming press have gotten their review units, and have written some reviews and comments about the handheld.  There have been 2 concerns that are starting to make me doubt whether I should purchase the Nintendo 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Battery Life</b></div><p>Apparently, if you're using the Nintendo 3DS under the lowest settings without any 3D, you can only get about 4 1/2 hours worth of game time out of it!  And then it takes about 3 1/2 hours to fully charge the thing.  This is ridiculous compared to my DS Lite, which I can play for hours and hours, and never think to charge it.</p><p>How is the Nintendo 3DS supposed to be a handheld if I'm always tethered to an electrical outlet?  How is this supposed to work if when I go to on a long vacation and want to play through Okamiden, or Zelda Spirit Tracks?  I'll be constantly charging the stupid thing.</p><p>Source from Ars Technica: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars" title="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/03/cradled-by-inadequacy-the-3ds-battery-put-to-the-test.ars</a></p><div class='title'><b>DS Rendering</b></div><p>The 3DS screens have higher resolution as the DS.  As such, if you're playing a DS in full screen mode, the image is stretched and the pixels are not 1 to 1.  You can fix this by running DS games in their native resolution, but it is small.  Almost, Gameboy Micro small.  Also, according to the Destructoid article, the colors are slightly washed out.  DS games look much more brilliant on a DSi or a DSi XL.</p><p>This would really hamper my experience with the 3DS for the first several months as I will be using it to play DS games.  With the added processing power of the 3DS, you'd think they make the games look better, much like the Playstation 2 did with PS1 games.</p><p>Source from Destructoid: <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml">http://www.destructoid.com/upgrading-to-3ds-don-t-get-rid-of-your-ds-just-yet--196897.phtml</a><br/>Also, Kotaku or Joystiq wrote the exact same thing a few weeks ago.</p><div class='title'><b>Buy or not Buy</b></div><p>So now, I'm a little torn.  It seems like if I get a 3DS, I will still be using my DS quite often.  I might only use the 3DS for 3DS games (of which none I care about), or the built in games (which are not full games, but little time wasters), or the eStore (which won't even be ready by launch).</p><p>Let's take a look at a timeline.</p><p>November 21st, 2004 - Nintendo DS<br/>June 11th, 2006 - Nintendo DS Lite<br/>April 5th, 2009 - Nintendo DSi<br/>March 29th, 2010 - Nintendo DSi XL</p><p>March 27th, 2010 - Nintendo 3DS</p><p>With the release of each recent handheld, they've had another one fixing problems not too long after.  With the original horrid ugly looking DS, they replaced that thing with the pretty DS Lite a year and a half later.  The DS Lite fixed all the design problems they had with the DS.  It improved battery life, full LCD screens, in a smaller, more compact design.  I did not own a DS until the DS Lite was released, and by then, there was an actual reason to own one.</p><p>Given the uproar about the current battery life of the Nintendo 3DS, I doubt it'll take long before they come up with the solution.  I should really wait for that solution rather than spending $250 on something that might end up sitting on my shelf for the months to come.</p><p>If anything, the release of the Nintendo 3DS should bring down the price of used DSs.  Maybe I'll pick up a DSi XL.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space Extraction + Severed" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space-extraction-severed">Dead Space Extraction + Severed</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 7, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Dead Space Extraction</b></div><p>In 2009, the now Visceral Games produced a Dead Space spinoff named Extraction.  It was a Wii title, and it was an on-rails shooter.  What better direction for the series than to make this moody adventure game into a fast paced action game.  And then to release it on a platform that has the least amount of your fan base.  I'm not really sure why they thought this was a good idea.  And it seems they won't make that mistake again as it horribly tanked in sales.</p><p>Being a fan of Dead Space, I had eventual plans to buy it.  My local Wal*mart always has copies, and I would probably take the plunge once the price point hit $20.  But last year's E3 came with some amazing news.  With the upcoming release of the Playstation Move, Visceral was upscaling the graphics, and including the game FOR FREE with each initial copy of Dead Space 2!</p><p>And thank god it was free.  I finished it the other day, and $20 is still a bit much.  It's a decent on-rails shooter, but the name "Dead Space" brings in some very weighted expectations.  Dead Space is a very solitary experience.  It's a game that crawls into your head and exercises your ears.  Most enemies are taken on a few at a time, and using the environment can lend itself well to taking down swarms of them.</p><p>An on-rails shooter is the exact opposite of that.  Enemies pop up, and you shoot them down.  Hit the weak spot for massive damage.  Bang bang bang!  Also, now it's two player! No longer a solitary experience. And you're always running around in a group of two to five people.</p><p>I am glad I played though it, though.  Story-wise, Dead Space Extraction takes place directly before Dead Space 1.  You play several characters on the surface of Aegis VII (or whatever) when the outbreak occurs.  You find a couple of survivors, escape the surface of the planet to the Ishimura, and then eventually escape the Ishimura.  It sets up a couple things in Dead Space 1, and ends almost right as the next game begins.</p><p>It's fun to see some of the expanded universe of Dead Space, but I don't really find the story all that interesting.  Hurrah, there's a dangerous space object that turns people crazy and into monsters.  It's really just background setup for the game's senario.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 2 Severed</b></div><p>So anyway, most of your characters in Extraction survive past the end, but their stories aren't over.  Last week, Visceral released an $8 expansion for Dead Space 2 entitled Severed, which continues the tale of two characters from Extraction.  They both happen to be on Titan while Isaac is running around killing things.  You play soldier Gabe Weller, as he tries to make it to his Wife, Luxine.</p><p>Severed is actually pretty amazing.  It's tight and short story that brings together all the aspects I love about Dead Space.  As you're running through the mines, separate areas are distinct by the sounds of the loud, nearby machinery.  The environment actually uses your senses to spook you, rather than scare tactics.  And the story actually adds a little depth to the Dead Space universe.</p><p>It's definitely worth playing.</p><div class='title'><b>The Universe</b></div><p>Besides these games, EA has done a whole lot with the Dead Space IP.  There's a couple other games, plus a few movies and books too.  I haven't touched any of that crap.  But, given my investment into the series already, I might consider checking more of this stuff out.</p><p>Dead Space Ignition - PSN Title and prequel to Dead Space 2<br/>Dead Space Downfall - Animated film that takes place in between Extraction and Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Aftermath - Animated film that takes place after Dead Space 1<br/>Dead Space Comic Book - A Comic Book that takes place before Downfall<br/>Dead Space Martyr - A novel that focuses on the Unitology religion.<br/>Dead Space Salvage - A Comic book that takes place some time between Dead Space 1 and 2.</p><p>I think this shows how poor the story of Dead Space is. All of these spin-offs center around the events in the game itself.  The only real universe building they've done is that novel which centers on the Unitology religion that keep coming back to.  Everything else is basically "and then this happened!" rather than "and this is why it happened."<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nintendo 3DS" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nintendo-3ds">Nintendo 3DS</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 2, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The Nintendo 3DS was released in Japan over last weekend, and only 26 days until its release in the states.  I have had mine preordered since Nintendo announced the price and release date, and I am super excited.  Not necessarily because of the 3D capabilties, nor any of the games, but mostly as a replacement for my Nintendo DS Lite.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo DS Lite</b></div><p>My Nintendo DS was part of the second release wave of the Nintendo DS Lite in Japan, almost 5 years ago.  I wasn't initially into the DS, mostly because of the aesentics.  It looked like a frampy piece of tech designed around the chipset inside.  There really weren't that many games for it either.</p><p>When they unveiled the sleak and sexy design of the DS Lite, it completely turned around my opinion.  By that time, there were games that were actually worth my time.  Tetris DS, Phoenix Wright, Electroplankton and Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow were the first games I owned for the handheld, and still remain as some of the best game offered for the platform.</p><p>Over the past 5 years, I have played my Nintendo DS so much that the touch screen can no longer be correctly configured.  Games like Trauma Center and Ouendan are unplayable.  It's time for an upgrade.</p><p>Last year, I planned on replacing my DS with one of those DSi XLs.  Unfortunately, Nintendo made an incredibly stupid PR move.  One week before the DSi XL were to be released in the states, they announced the Nintendo 3DS.  The successor to the DS platform.  I was all set to replace my DS with a $190 DSi XL, and they lost my money.  Upgrading to the new platform is a much more lucrative prospect.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo 3DS</b></div><p>And now we're just 26 days away!  While there really aren't any launch titles that interest me, there are several on the horizon I care about: Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time 3D, Professor Layton v. Phoenix Wright, Megaman Legends 3 and the newly announced Super Mario title.  There's also plenty of DSi Ware games that I haven't had a chance to play having never owned a DSi.</p><p>But!  What really interests me are the built games and features of the 3DS.  You can capture 3D photos and film. There are augmented reality games to play.  There's a built in pedometer that unlock rewards.  And there's a thing called <b>Street Pass</b>.</p><p>The Street Pass is a communication sensor that will connect to any other 3DSs you may pass by throughout your day.  It will transfer your Mii to them, and their Mii to you.  Besides building a social gaming web of your daily life, you can use these Miis with two built-in games: a Puzzle game and a Quest game.  For the puzzle game, Each Mii you meet you can exchange jigsaw puzzle pieces, and form some random Nintendo images.  In the Quest game, each Mii will take on monsters in a dungeon until they're scared off.</p><p>Here's a video showing off the Street Pass stuff: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caf9XH2r1HQ</a>.</p><p>I would expect conventions and other massive nerd gatherings to be invaluable towards building a huge list of stranger's Miis.  PAX West this year should be fantastic. ^_^</p><p>Anyway, I'm excited.  Though, I'll mostly use the 3DS to play DS titles.  Namely Pokemon.  Now that I'll have two DSs, I can trade Pokemon back and forth between my games willy nilly, and not need to borrow a friend's.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Dead Space 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 28, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Dead Space 2 is a game of many emotions.  For me, it was a 3 stage process.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 1: Disappointment</b></div><p>Isaac awoke from his bed in a medical lab somewhere and was told to get running!  Oh my, I don't remember these contols being so disorienting.  If you break the display into 3 sections, Isaac is positioned right between the left and middle sections.  Initially, this forces me to think that pushing directly up on the joystick will make Issac turn to the left slightly.  So, I try to compensate by push up and right, which make him run forward to the right.  I compensate by pulling back left, but then he doesn't move as far left I was thinking.  ugh :(</p><p>Also, Isaac was in a straight jacket the whole time, so that might be why it was so disorienting.  After an hour of running around, I was getting rather frustrated, so I put it down and went to bed.  I picked it up the next day with my expectations realigned, and ready to continue the journey.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 2: Delightment</b></div><p>Once I had become one with the controls, Dead Space's wonderful concept of immerson took center stage.  I was no longer controlling Isaac, I WAS Isaac.  Dead Space 2 is right at home with everything I loved about the first game, namely the environment and the sound.</p><div class='title'><b>The Moon!</b></div><p>While going through offices, homes, and stores in this mess of a space station or space ship or whatever, people kept referring to it as "Titan".  I figured it was just the name of the place, until I entered a room with a complete view of the outside.  It was Saturn!  The planet Saturn!  It hung so beautifully in the spacey sky.  And I realized that by "Titan", they meant the MOON!</p><p>In Dead Space 1, they just made up some planet for the Ishimura to crack.  I think it was called Aegis?  Actually, seeing how Aegis is greek, there probably is a moon with that name in our Solar System, but no where near reknowned as Titan.</p><p>The Titan moon base continued with Dead Space's theme of an organic, yet synthetic environment, ala Alien Resurrection.  And it's horrific display of gore and twisted ideals, ala Event Horizon.  Unlike the Ishimura from the first game, the Titan moon base feels much more comfortable.  Much of the environment feels dank because all the lights have been blown out and there's blood everywhere.  Before all hell broke loose, I'm sure much the locations looked a lot like Star Trek, or Mass Effect.  They just needed a fresh coat of blood to tear them down.</p><p>Now that we're running through a sustainable ecosystem, rather than an engineering vessel, there is much more variety.  You find yourself going through residential units, a mall, a church, and an elementary school, before you get to the space station stuff.</p><p>Dead Space doesn't miss the opportunity to go creepy with the elementary school.  There are now baby necromorphs and 5th grader necromorphs.  I think the 5th graders are my favorite enemy in the game.  10 or 15 of them will appear from a doorway and attempt to swarm you, while keeping their distance.</p><p>Rather than shooting them down with my gun, I always go for melee. Â It reminds me a lot of this website: <a href="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/" title="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/">How many five years olds could you take in a fight?</a> The website is purely theoretical, and this was my "real life" chance to find out!  I was able to take down about 6 of 'em, before 3 more jumped on top of me and brought me down.  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp">Get these goddamn children off of me!</a></p><div class='title'><b>The Mood</b></div><p>Unfortunately with the amount of variety in the environment itself, sound took second place to art.  While the mood is as immersive as the first game, each area is distinct because of the environment itself, not because it sounds different.  Two of my favorite moments from Dead Space 1 were the engine room, and the first moment you hit space.</p><p>The engine room was massively loud.  The whirring of the engine completely over came my senses, and made progress a bit disorienting.  Even more so when the enemies broke into the room and I had to fight them while the huge, loud engine was right on top of me.  There is nothing like this in Dead Space 2.</p><p>The only parts in Dead Space 2 where the sound takes center stage is Space, which is completely the same as the first game.  There are several points when you are thrust into the vacuum of space to complete your task.  When this happens all sound is sucked out of the environment, and the only thing you hear is yourself.  The beeping on your oxygen tank, your breath as you exhale into your helmet, and the muddled clomps of your foot steps.</p><p>Astronauts describe the feeling of being in space as very isolating.  There is nothing between you and space, but the layer of your space suit.  Dead Space nailed this feeling perfectly, so I'm glad they brought it back for the sequel.  And now you have thrusters to fly through Space!</p><div class='title'><b>Mood Killer</b></div><p>One thing I really hate about Dead Space 2 is the use of scare tactics.  Dead Space 2 does an incredible job of immersing you in the environment and lulling you into an intent state, only to tear everything down by a monster popping out of the wall, or jumping out at you from behind a corner.  It doesn't make the game scary.  Being startled is not being scared. Â By the fourth or fifth time, I just shrug it off and blow them away. There's no sense of danger, or being spooked.</p><p>It's the difference between somewhere coming up from behind you and yelling "BOO", rather than walking through the woods at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 3: Frustration</b></div><p>It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt :(</p><p>Dead Space 2 is quite an enjoyable experience until you get to the final chapters of the game.  All story points converge at the government sector of the moon base.  You've lead all the enemies of the game to this point, so now you need to fight them all.  And you have a new enemy which cannot be killed, only slowed down.</p><p>Throughout the entire game, ammunition and health had never really been a problem.  I have died quite a bit, but it was usually because I did something stupid.  Dead Space would train me not to do that, and point out it should be done this way.  I adapted and continued.  I would always have enough health packs lying around to heal me, and plenty of ammo around to keep me moving through the hordes of enemies.</p><p>In the second to last chapter, Dead Space pretty much gave up on this balance.  The enemies were more difficult, and there were more of them.  I started using a whole lot of ammunition taking them down without enough to return to take on the next wave.  So, I started getting hit more, and using up my health packs.  Wave after wave of enemies continued, and I no longer had health to regen.</p><p>I basically pushed and shoved my way through all the enemies to make progress, which resulted in many many lives, and many many restarts.  Yes, I wasn't really thinking about how I could improve, but with constant failure, I just wanted to get it done.  I finally made it to the final checkout, which was complete with a Store to resupply.</p><p>What awaited behind that checkout was another constant horde of enemies, I had to push through to get to the final boss.  But when I made it, I was all out of ammo and health again.  Basically fucked.  I tried taking them down, but after 30 minutes, I quit.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>With a good night's rest to think about my options, I returned with a plan.  I sold all my extra ammo and focused completely on the only gun I had completely leveled up, my Plasma Cutter.  With my strategy realigned, I tore through the horde, pushing most of them aside to greet the final boss, again.  This time I blasted the shit of them.  They hardly stood a chance.</p><p>Overall, Dead Space 2 did not let me down.  I feel like it had a few incredible scenes and sequences, sewn together by a solid base.  Before I got to the end, I had a very enjoyable time, and I'll probably pick it up again to chew away at the remaining achievements.</p><p>I would totally recommend Dead Space 2 for anyone that has fond memories of the original.</p><p>Also, the legend continues (or begins) with Dead Space Extraction included on the disc!  Plus, there is DLC releasing tomorrow that ties Extraction into Dead Space 2, entitled "Severed".<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX East Panels announced" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced">PAX East Panels announced</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's too bad I won't be able to attend this year.  But there's plenty of stuff going on in the midwest to keep me busy.</p><p>If I were going to PAX East, these are the panels I would definitely want to attend:</p><p><b>1UP Presents: Retronauts Vs. 16 Bits</b> - Friday @ 3pm<br/>Live recording of 1up's defunct Retronauts podcast including panelists Jeremy Parish, Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi.  Though, they will most likely record this panel and release it on 1up.com, so missing this panel won't hurt.  I ususally never go anyway.</p><p><b>From Background To Center Stage: Building Game Worlds As Main Characters</b> - Friday @ 5pm<br/>A panel including Irrational Games members Ken Levine and Shawn Elliot, headed by Julian Murdoch.  Plenty of Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite matters included...</p><p><b>Inside Game Localization</b> - Friday @ 8pm<br/>Including the leads at Kajiya Productions as they discuss localizing Final Fantasy 12 and Tactics Ogre, among other things.</p><p><b>PAX East Chiptune Showcase</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>Zen Albatross hosts an event with some of the best chip artists from the east coast including Sabrepulse, Br1ght Pr1mate, and himself.</p><p><b>Owned but Independent</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>At the same time, a panel including Brian Raffel and Eric Biessman of local Madison game studio, Raven, discuss what it's like to be "owned" by Activision.  Even though, I would end up going to the Chiptune panel, it'd be nice to support local game development. ^_^</p><p><b>Videogame Antiques Roadshow</b> - Saturday @ 6:30pm<br/>A panel including Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi discuss game collecting and finding value in old games.</p><p><b>Making the "Citizen Kane" of Poker Games</b> - Sunday @ 3pm<br/>Idle Thumbs alert.  Sean Vanaman, Jake Rodkin and other Telltale Games members speak about the development of Poker Night at the Inventory.</p><p>These are all the ones that really popped out at me.  There's also the really high attendance panels such as the Penny Arcade panels, and everything in the main room, but I usually skip those.  I've attended enough of those in the past that I would know what to expect and there's plenty of other things that would keep me busy.</p><p>But yeah, I'm skipping PAX East this year.

| June 15, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This year has been pretty amazing for gaming.  January saw the release of Mass Effect 2.  February saw the release of Heavy Rain, plus Ace Attorney Edgeworth.  And March saw the release of...  just every other game announced last year.  Final Fantasy XIII, Pokemon Gold/Silver, Yakuza 3, and the Dragon Age Expansion.  So many games were released that I was seriously burned out.</p><p>All 4 of those games are huge time investments, and all were released within 7 days of each other?  Out of the 4, I chose Pokemon.  Not the smartest choice seeing how the game is nothing but level grinding and repetitive battling, in series that doesn't really evolve.  My gaming has come stand still.  So, I have hopes for E3.</p><p>Last year, E3 gave my interest in gaming a jump start.  The end of 2008 really annoyed me with some mediocre titles, and there really wasn't much to look forward to.  Microsoft, Nintendo, and Sony each gave me a reason to look towards the future.  Now that I'm down again, I have the same hopes for this coming year.  Maybe something will peak my interest, and snowball into continuous hype.</p><div class='title'><b>The Big 3</b></div><p>Tony has some great summaries of Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony's press conferences for this year on his blog.  Which is here: <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org" title="http://blog.t-kun.org">blog.t-kun.org</a>.  As a condensed version:</p><p><b>Microsoft</b>'s conference was quite boring.  They'd showed off Call of Duty, Metal Rising, Gears 3, and a bunch of Natal (now named Kinect) titles.  They also showed off a redesign model of the 360 shipping to retailers now.</p><p><b>Nintendo</b>'s conference was all about Nostalgia.  There's a new Legend of Zelda, new Donkey Kong Country, new Goldeneye, and a new Kirby game.  Plus, they showed off the Nintendo 3DS, the successor to the DS.</p><p><b>Sony</b>'s conference was pretty disappointing.  They announced new ad campaigns, which is useless to gamers.  They focused on 3D technology, Playstation Plus, Playstation Move.  They showed off a couple games including Little Big Planet 2, Dead Space 2, and unveiled PS3 Twisted Metal!  But NO mention of The Last Guardian, or anything Trico.</p><p>All in all, Nintendo really stole the show.  But there was a little bit in all the conferences that has gotten me excited.  Plus other stuff from the show floor.  Here are some specific thoughts about what's being going on at E3:</p><div class='title'><b>Metal Gear Rising</b></div><p>I'm not the biggest Metal Gear fan, but MGS3 and 4 are definitely two of the finest games I've ever played.  I love both those titles, and I'm definitely interested in the next console game in that series.  During Microsoft's press conference Hideo Kojima took the stage, and introduced a new trailer which included gameplay: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvrbUWEKRnk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvrbUWEKRnk">Youtube Link</a></p><p>The trailer shows Raiden cutting enemies and pieces of the environment in any direction at will.    Towards the end Raiden pushes an enemy in the air, and clearly slices through his legs and then again through his arms and torso.  This game looks incredible.</p><p>Although, isn't Metal Gear supposed to be about Espionage?  This gameplay looks badass but it's not covert in the slightest.  I don't know how they plan on fashioning this as a Metal Gear game, when it looks nothing like a Metal Gear game.</p><div class='title'><b>Xbox 360 Redesign</b></div><p>With the on going deluge of crappy Kinect titles, and 360 games I had absolutely no interest in, Microsoft ended their conference with a reveil few people expected.  The redesign of the Xbox 360.  It was somewhat leaked before the conference, but nobody really paid attention to it.</p><p>It's smaller, quiter, and better looking than the 5 year old model.  It has built in Wifi as well, plus a 250 gig harddrive.  Unfortunately, it looks like they've completely gotten rid of the memory card slots, which I frequently use.  But everything else is there.</p><p>The new model costs $300, which is the price of the high-end Xbox 360 right now.  Though, those will drop down to $250.  These new models are shipping now, and will be at retailers by Sunday at the latest.</p><p>It's pretty nice that Microsoft finally got around to redesign their outdated hardware, but almost everyone already has an Xbox.  I kinda want one of these, but I already have one.  Plus, I have a Wifi adapter.  And my Xbox works great.  I don't need a new one.</p><div class='title'><b>Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword</b></div><p>Nintendo wasted no time in their conference, and once the lights dimmed and the new Wii Legend of Zelda illuminated the screens.  Shigeru Miyamoto hopped on stage, and showed off the fully "one-to-one" motions of the Wii mote with Link, which seemed rather janky and about as imprecise as any Wii game.</p><p>Apparently reports from the E3 floor say the game is much easier than how it looked when Miyamoto fumbled on stage, but I don't really want a full motion Wii Legend of Zelda.  Twilight Princess is just about as perfect you can get with their current hardware.  I thought the DS was home to the goofy spin-off Zeldas, and now we have this?</p><p>It does look really pretty though: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5564603/zelda-skyward-sword-is-inspired-bydead-french-painters" title="http://kotaku.com/5564603/zelda-skyward-sword-is-inspired-bydead-french-painters">kotaku article</a></p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo 3DS</b></div><p>Back in March, Nintendo officially announced the Nintendo 3DS, a 3D handheld that required no glasses and is poised to be the successor to the DS.  I really need a new Nintendo DS.  My launch edition of the Nintendo DS Lite is beat to shit, and I had planned on purchasing a Nintendo DSi XL.  Nintendo just happened to announce this thing 6 days before its release, so I kept my money.</p><p>The press conference didn't really show much, and they admitted it was hard to actually convey the product over video.  But this thing is the talk of the show.  Twitter is full of people saying it is the best thing Nintendo has ever done.  Apparently the 3DS is an amazing feat you really have to see for yourself.</p><p>Well, I need a new DS and my money was already going to this thing, so I'm definitely in.  All this hype is really just a cherry on the top of a cake of necessity.</p><p>In addition, they announced the return of Kid Icarus premiered on the 3DS.  The game looks like a on-rails shooter that doesn't ever compare to the recent release of Sin and Punishment 2 on the Wii.  Why would they even try to compete with that fantastic game?  I dunno.  I guess it's better than trying to make a side-scrolling metroidvania Kid Icarus.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo Nostalgia</b></div><p>Legend of Zelda and Kid Icarus weren't the only franchises getting new titles.  It seems that Nintendo announced or showed a new game for every existing franchise they own.  They announced a new Donkey Kong Country game, which looked pretty good.  An actual new iteration of Goldeneye, which will probably see high numbers of Nintendo online network.  A new Kirby game in the vane of Paper Mario.  They showed much more footage of Metroid Other M, which I'm certainly interested in.</p><p>Nintendo kept the showcase of titles flowing, until their unveil of the 3DS.  But it looks like the 3DS is a nostalgia house of its own.  Many blog articles and reports have showed upcoming releases such as Star Fox 64 on 3DS, Ocarina of Time on 3DS, Metal Gear Solid 3 on 3DS, Kingdom Hearts 1 on 3DS.  It looks like it's setup as a 3D virtual console of some of the best games from the past decade or so.</p><p>Definitely interesting.  Though, I wonder how much all of this will cost...</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation 3D</b></div><p>Sony had its own idea of what 3D meant for gaming.  They announced they would be the home for 3D gaming in your living room.  They rationalized since Blu-ray discs hold so much data, developers can easily fit a 3D version of their game on the SAME disc as the regular version.  Plus, a few current titles will be getting 3D updates through software patches.  As such, every single PS3 on the market today is fully 3D compatible and requires no additional purchase at all.</p><p>Oh...  except for a 3D compatible television.  Plus, you'll need some 3D glasses too.  But if you're home entertainment setup is already 3D compatible (which it's not), the Playstation 3 will fit right in.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation Move</b></div><p>Playstation Move was another big highlight for Sony's press conference.  This is their answer to the Wii, and directly inspired by the Wii as well.  You have the Playstation Move Wiimote, and the Playstation Move nunchunk.  The Playstation 3 Eye Camera tracks these movements, and delivers motion controls that actually seem much better than the Wii.</p><p>They showed off a bunch of games I had absolutely no interest in.  But they mentioned that Heavy Rain would be getting an PS Move update.  They also mentioned a Time Crisis game.</p><p>They should've showed off this game:</p><div class='title'><b>Child of Eden</b></div><p>At Ubisoft's press conference on Monday evening, Tetsuya Mizuguchi took the stage and began demonstrated his newest game, Child of Eden.  This Kotaku article has a video:  <a href="http://kotaku.com/5563293/this-is-basically-rez-for-the-playstation-move" title="http://kotaku.com/5563293/this-is-basically-rez-for-the-playstation-move">click</a>.</p><p>That Kotaku article also says that it's a game born from the basic concept as Rez, one of my favorite games ever.  It's an on-rails shooter, where the environment and music flow along with shots fired from your character.  This trailer is absolutely beautiful. ^_^</p><p>It's announced for the Playstation Move and Xbox's Kinect.  One reporter asked if you could still use a standard controller, to which Mizuguchi replied "yes", so I guess it doesn't really matter if you have a PS Move.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 2</b></div><p>Premiered online a couple days before E3, shown during EA's press conference and continued into Sony's, Visceral Games gave a glimpse as to what Dead Space 2 is all about.  In 2008, Dead Space blew me away with its amazing graphics, SOUND, and amazing environments.  Even though it borrowed quite a bit from other established games, it really proved they knew what they were doing.</p><p>I'm pretty excited for Dead Space 2, and interested to see what sort of exclusivity deal they had with Sony.  I'm quite delighted by what they actually announced.</p><p>Dead Space 2 had a limited edition release for the Playstation 3 which includes an HD, Playstation Move compatible version of Dead Space Extraction.  Dead Space Extraction was released as a Wii Exclusive earlier this year.  And while it was the greatest game ever, and really didn't fit with the tone of Dead Space 1, and was released on the WRONG console, I was still interested in it.  I played some of it at PAX last year, I found it enjoyable on its own.</p><p>I planned on buying it for Wii when it hit less than $20, but now that a BETTER version is coming for a console I care about...  I'm all in.</p><div class='title'><b>Playstation Move consideration</b></div><p>Now there's 3 games for Playstation 3 that are Playstation Move compatible that I actually care about, and plan on owning in the upcoming year.  With the Playstation Move showcase, Sony also announced it's pricey strategy.  A single Playstation Move Wii Mote costs $50, while an additional nunchunk is $30.  Nintendo prices their Wii controllers for the same price.  Plus, I already own a Playstation 3 Camera for some reason.</p><p>If I only need a single Playstation Move Wii Mote, then why not?  I probably will get one.  $50 isn't THAT bad.  An extra $30 for a nunchunk might need more consideration, but who knows.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest of Sony</b></div><p>I find it really annoying that they didn't mention ANYTHING about The Last Guardian.  They spent so much time on their stupid advertising campaigns, which mean nothing to us, and completely ignored anything from Team ICO.  It doesn't sound like they even have anything on the show floor regarding it either.</p><p>I don't really care about Killzone 3, or Little Big Planet 2, or Final Fantasy XIV.  They finally gave Gran Turismo 5 a date (November 2nd), and (later) announced a collector's edition which looks worthless.</p><p>Their big reveal of the day was the HIGHLY anticipated announcement of PS3 Twisted Metal.  After years of denying rumors and avoiding questions, David Jaffe took the stage and showed us what he'd been working on.</p><p>I missed most of the demo, but what I saw was a shit load of players battling in a massive team deathmatch mode.  It looked pretty fun, just like the hay-day of car combat multiplayer games.</p><div class='title'><b>So far</b></div><p>Even though I was pretty down, they are definitely some titles I'm looking forward to.  Metal Gear Rising, Dead Space 2, Child of Eden, Nintendo 3DS, Metroid Other M...  Plus there are some games I haven't looked into as much, such as Dead Rising 2, Castlevania Lords of the Shadow, and that new XBLA Castlevania.</p><p>Playstation Move will probably end up in my home with games like Heavy Rain, Child of Eden, Dead Space Extraction, and maybe that Time Crisis game, too.  Microsoft's Natal/Kinect doesn't interest me at all.  Dance Central looked kinda fun, but everything else looks horrible.</p><p>It should be an interesting Christmas Season, much like last year. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Road to Starcraft II Beta" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-road-to-starcraft-ii-beta">The Road to Starcraft II Beta</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 7, 2010 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>April 8th</b></div><p>About a month, Blizzard announced <a href="/old/v7/starcraft-ii-collectors-edition" title="/starcraft-ii-collectors-edition">release details</a> for Starcraft II.  A couple hours afterward Amazon listed the Collector's Edition for sale, and I preordered my copy.  I was excited.  I logged into battle.net and looked around.</p><div class='title'><b>April 10th</b></div><p>Two days later, I got an email from Blizzard saying that my WOW account has been suspended because I had a virus on my computer.  Or something to that effect...</p><p><em>"An investigation of the World of Warcraft account DYRESCHLOCK has produced evidence that the computer(s) used to play the account are infected by a virus, Trojan or keylogger.</em></p><p><em>"To protect your privacy and security, we have temporarily disabled the account for a 24 hour period. During this time, we highly recommend that you follow the below steps to protect yourself and the account from unauthorized third party access."</em> -Blizzard</p><p>Some might find it odd that I even have a WOW account to begin with...  But what I find more odd is that not only haven't I played WOW in over two years, my account hasn't been active since I quit. I shrugged off the email since it was absurd.</p><div class='title'><b>April 12</b></div><p>Two days later, I get another email from Blizzard saying they've closed my account for violating their Terms of Use.</p><p><em>"This account was closed because one or more characters were identified exchanging, or contributing to the exchange of, in-game property (items or gold) for "real-world" currency. This exchange process negatively impacts the World of Warcraft game environment by detracting from the value of the in-game economy."</em></p><p>Apparently my inactive character was trading gold on eBay?  While still being odd, this posed a great problem:  My Battle.net account is now closed.  I can't log in or do anything now. :/</p><p>The bottom of the email said that if I had any disputes, go to this page: <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=exploitfaq&amp;rhtml=true" title="http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;tag=exploitfaq&amp;rhtml=true">http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?tag=exploitfaq</a>.</p><p>For the most part it says if I have not violated the terms of use, and have never given away my login information, contact the Support Team.  I went to the Support Team page, filled out their form, and wrote a description of my account closure.</p><div class='title'><b>April 14th</b></div><p>Two days go by and I receive another email from Blizzard stating that they have determined my account was <em>"accessed by someone not authorized to do so by the World of Warcraft Terms of Use"</em>.  Well, at least they no longer believe I was screwing around on my inactive account.  Unfortunately, my account is still closed and I must go through the process of reactiving it.</p><p>The email sends a link to a PDF on how to reactivate my account: <a href="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf" title="http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf">http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/WoW/other/WoW_Account_Recovery.pdf</a></p><p>I need to fill out this form, sign it, and send it to Blizzard along with a photocopy of an official government form of ID.  Alternatively, I could scan my Driver's License and email it instead, but I don't have a scanner.</p><p>Since this sounded like a lot of work, I just left it as a problem for my future self to deal with.</p><div class='title'><b>April 22nd</b></div><p>About a week later, Blizzard started handing out Starcraft II Beta codes to anyone who preordered the game.  I got an email from Amazon in the morning with my very own Beta code!  Whoo!  I can play Starcraft II right now!  Oh wait...  Thanks to the laziness of my past self, my Battle.net account is still closed.</p><p>On the way home, I stopped at Kinkos and photocopied my Driver's License.  When I got home, I filled out the form, packed everything into an envelope and shipped it off to Blizzard.</p><div class='title'><b>April 30th</b></div><p>Yet another week later, I received an email from Blizzard saying my account has been reactivated and my password has been reset!  I was out of town that weekend, so I was reading the email on my phone.</p><p>When I got back to my apartment, I powered up my computer and clicked the reactivation link in the email, but it had expired.  I tried reseting my password on Battle.net, but I wouldn't receive another reactivation email.  I tried a couple times, and each time it said it would send an email and follow the link inside.  I would receive nothing.</p><p>So, I waited.  Maybe it's backed up, and I'd receive those emails over night?  The next day, I received nothing.  Nor the following day.</p><div class='title'><b>May 5th</b></div><p>On Wednesday, I decided to try again.  Why not?  Oh hey, it worked this time.  I got the email.  I followed the link.  And my Battle.net account has been fully reactivated!  huzzah.  I entered my Beta code, and Starcraft II Beta appeared in my games list.  Battle.net gives you a tiny 2.6 mb file, which downloads the full installer for Starcraft II which is about 1.46 gigs.</p><p>My computer does not like the way Blizzard downloads files to my computer.  The Downloader would run for about 10 or 20 minutes and crash my computer with the Blue Hardware Failure Screen.  It would boot up just fine, start downloading, and in another 10 or 20 minutes, BAM, blue screen.</p><p>This happened for about 3 hours until my computer finally finished downloading the whole thing.  After all the hiccups, the installer ran perfectly fine, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Patching</b></div><p>I immediately ran Starcraft II, but...  there's a flood of patches that I need to download and install.  And I need to download and install each individual patch.  Which is absurd.</p><p>First off, I just finished downloading the full installer from your servers.  Why wasn't the application I installed on my computer fully patched to begin with?  You already control the file I just downloaded.  I wasn't installing this from a CD or an old installer I downloaded months ago.  I JUST downloaded the file.  Any download service such as PSN, Xbox Live, Steam, etc already does this.</p><p>Secondly, Why do I need to download each individual patch at a time?  Why aren't all these patches condensed into a single update?  Again, every single modern download service already does this.  Why doesn't Blizzard?</p><p>I don't get it...</p><p>Also, my computer hates these patches just as much as the initial installer, so my computer downloads half a patch and crashes.</p><div class='title'><b>Finally</b></div><p>One month of pain, and Starcraft II is finally running on my machine.  Upon startup it auto-detecting the graphical capabilities of my machine and set everything to the lowest settings. ^_^</p><p>It runs quite well though.  I'm actually surprised how well it runs after all the headaches of getting the thing setup.  The music studders a little bit, but that's about it for bugs.</p><p>There's not much to say about the game itself other than "yes, it's Starcraft."  It's a smoother, graphically updated version of the game with a couple new additions.  The graphics are pretty.  The music is catchy.</p><p>I absolutely suck at this game, but if you want to battle me feel free to add me as a friend.  ^_^  I like that they have 2 friend lists in the game.  One for Battle.net accounts and one for player accounts.  I can easily split those between people I know in real life (aka Friends), and other players I meet in the game.</p><p>So, If I know you in real life, just search for my Battle.net account using my main email address.  Otherwise, my player account is DyreSchlock.DyreSchlock.  I might change that to Schlock.Dyre to remove the redundancy.</p><div class='title'><b>Battle.net Account</b></div><p>I still have no actual idea why my Battle.net was closed.  Maybe they searched eBay for users with the same name?  I dunno...</p><p>I bought one of these things though:  <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822" title="http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822">The Battle.net Authenticator</a>, which is just an RSA key fob.  I wanted to buy one of these anyways, but I was waiting for a Starcraft II design.  I bought one immediately though, since I don't really want to go through the process of reactiviting my account again.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/12">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/10">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (40)
