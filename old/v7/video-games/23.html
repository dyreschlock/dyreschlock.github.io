| April 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Graphics</b></div><p>New York is the center stage for the end of humanity.  Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast (2)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast-2">End Gen Dreamcast (2)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 16, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>Karous</b></div><p>Karous was released in February 2007. I found this game on my latest trek back to Japan in my local new/used gaming store. They actually had a couple copies of the game, and one copy used for $45. I did think it over long and hard whether i should buy this game.. It is developed and self-published by Milestone, who also made Radilgy and Chaos Field. Chaos Field was actually a rather fun game, and Radilgy looked pretty crazy.. so, by association, i laid down my 4500 yen.</p><p>Karous is a very minimalist styled shooter through and through.  The graphics are cell-shaded and drenched in deep dark blues, greens and greys, but complemented with other over-used bright white.  It probably looked like a good idea on paper, but in execution looks very unfinished.  When you use cell-shading, you must be very aware of shapes and forms and how shadows well bring out the simplistic complexity of your subject.  I think cell-shading is a horrible medium for shooters because you have no time to soak in the subtleties and models are going to be too tiny to see any detail.</p><p>Unfortunately they carry this throughout each level like a dead horse.  I don't know if they re-use the same environments, but each stage looks exactly the same..  I really can't tell the difference.  All the enemies have the same grayscaled colors, so the bosses really can't be distinguished from each other easily.</p><p>The game does not scale very well either.  I can hardly see what the hell is going on with the game on my TV.  In Yoko mode, you can't even see what level your weapons are at.  Tate mode really isn't all that much better either.  Aliasing abound!</p><p>Anyways, the minimalistic theme continues into the music.  The soundtrack features plenty of broken drumming, chimes, and lack of melody that produces very experimental sounds.  It's a very different approach to a shooter OST and i'm not really sure that it works out for them.  You have no sense of suspense or thrill when playing levels..  It really ends up bothering me more than pulling me in.</p><p>The gameplay works very similar to Chaos Field.  You have 3 buttons..  One for shoot, one for bombs, and one for sword.  Also, when you stop shooting you have a shield which is automatically deployed.  Each of these attacks have a separate color.  (Green for sword, Blue for shot, Red for bomb, and Yellow for Shield.)  When you hit an enemies, they'll shimmer in the color of which weapon they are weakest against.  Most shimmer in Red, but you'll get the occasional green or yellow.</p><p>Each of your weapons can be powered up through use or grabbing power-ups.  These power-ups usually come from drones of like enemies, or big ass enemies.  You'll usually get a little blue triangle which you can smack a couple times with your sword to power-up.  Also, i think just general firing and killing powers up your bomb.</p><p>Overall, this game is challenging, but i'd only recommend it as a last resort.  The graphics are actually pretty bad, and the music doesn't complement the gameplay well.  It's actually kind of annoying to play..  I guess i now know the reason why Tom Sawyer had so many copies of the game..  Oh well...  the gameplay does have some redeeming qualities.</p><div class='title'><b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b></div><p>Exelica is the most recent Dreamcast game which came up March 2007. Purple Godzilla in Seattle, WA showcased this game at Sakura-Con and had it for a very fair price of $65, considering it was nearly identical to the Japanese price of 6500 yen. I had seen Exelica in Japanese arcades before, and #five actually played a bit too. The gameplay looked very different than your normal shmup, so i figured, hell, i'd give it a shot.</p><p>In Trigger Heart Exelica, you play Exelica or Crueltear, two anime girls out to save or defeat their friend or foe.  You wage war against an onslaught of futuristic space ships in your flying power armor.  The game reminds me a lot of Shikigami no Shiro for some reason, even though the two games are completely different.  Massive points are obtained through collecting gold pieces from destroyed enemies and fire.</p><p>You have 3 attacks: normal fire, bombs and grapple.  Exelica and Crueltear have different shoot waves..  Exelica is rather spread out, while Crueltear's is straight on.  Bombs are as standard as ever.</p><p>The grapple technique is what makes this game so unique.  You can grapple nearly any enemy on the screen.  Bigger enemies will take a little longer..  Once you've captured them, they will shield you from oncoming bullets, and you can also smash them into enemies for massive points and damage.  When you move back and forth while holding an enemy, you'll swing back and forth..  swinging the enemy all the way around you will put you into a spin that'll almost shield you completely against enemy fire.  When you let go, the enemy goes flying and it's explosion destroys everything in the immediate area.</p><p>This makes some impossible to dodge areas essential for using the grapple technique.  There's one particular part in Stage 3 where the entire screen is jam packed with enemies..  you can't even get around them.  Not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of bullets..  Grappling one enemy and tossing him in the center of all that mess will clean out a lot of your obstacles.</p><p>The graphics are pretty decent.  They aren't crazy mind blowing graphics, but they are certainly don't suck.  The music also compliments the game quite well.  Unfortunately the sounds could use a lot more bass.  Blowing up things is MUCH more satisfying with a sound that you can feel in your body.</p><p>Overall, this game is pretty fun, albeit spinning around while grappling an enemy can be difficult to get the hang of.  A little nick picky thing that i don't really like is that you start off with infinite credits, rather than eventually unlocking more over time.  Starting off with only a set amount of credits will inspire you to get better at the game, and eventually push yourself to greatness.  Having the whole game laid out to you on your first sitting is very unrewarding.</p><p>$65 is a very steep price for this game though.  That money would be better spent on Under Defeat.  If you came across this game in an arcade, i'd definitely recommend a few coins of play to see if you like it.</p><div class='title'><b>The tears of the ages...</b></div><p>Unfortunately, this is the end of the Dreamcast.  As of February this year, Sega has officially stopped all production of the GD-Rom medium, and 2 week ago, declared that on September 28th, 2007, Dreamcast Repair Services will cease completely.  The Dreamcast lasted nearly 9 years in the marketplace...  not too many consoles can say that.  Of course, those companies have bigger better projects to focus on.</p><p>This doesn't spell demise for the Naomi boards..  In fact, Triangle Service is currently developing their latest shmup, Exzeal, for the Naomi cabinets and set to be released this year.  Triangle Service had previous released Trizeal in 2005 for the Dreamcast.  This doesn't guarantee a Dreamcast release though..  Trizeal has been ported over to Ps2 for a wider audience.</p><p>G.rev's most recent game, Senko no Ronde, was also Naomi GD-Rom, but was remade and updated for home release on the Xbox 360, which is coming to the US next month thanks to Ubi Soft.  Senko no Ronde is shmup fighter hybrid type game.</p><div class='title'><b>Since Naomi<br/></b></div><p>Though Naomi development still goes on with 3rd party Arcade developers, Sega has moved on.  Not that long after Naomi originally debuted, Sega released the Naomi 2 in 2000.  Naomi 2 was a beefed up Naomi board with more better everything.  Though, with the pending death of the Dreamcast, Sega began focusing on other hardware.</p><p>Namco had already taken a cue from Sega, and had partnered with Sony to release Playstation-like hardware in the Arcades..  With console sales heading the gaming industry, Sega looked to the other consoles for Arcade hardware.</p><p>In 2002, Sega released the Chihiro hardware based on the Xbox.  Sega made a few changes though by scrapping the DVD-Rom drive for a GD-Rom drive, and make the RAM expandable for upgrades.  They also made full use of the communication capabilities of the Xbox and developed a slew of networkable titles.  These games you could play against anyone else in an Arcade across Japan.</p><p>Sega continued with their idea of making porting games easy from Arcade to Xbox and Xbox to Arcade.. Unfortunately, the Memory upgrades were used heavily in the Arcade which made scaling games to the home unit difficult.  Wikipedia points out that Outrun 2 used 512mb memory in the arcade, while the Xbox had only 64mb to work with.</p><p>Also in 2002, Sega has teamed up with Namco and Nintendo to release the Triforce Arcade hardware.  Partnership and development centered around the Nintendo Gamecube hardware and the release of F-Zero AX/GX, one of my favorite games of all time.  This was also a good opportunity for Nintendo to get some market share in the Arcades again..  Aside from F-Zero, Mario Kart GP is the other notable release for this hardware.  Mario Kart 2 was released early this year.</p><p>I guess the Sega, Namco, Nintendo Triforce partership was the middle ground for all big-name console and arcade hardware developers..  Sega w/ Microsoft, Namco w/ Sony, and Sega/Namco in the middle with Nintendo.</p><div class='title'><b>Turning to the future, PC in 2004</b></div><p>In 2004, Sega released their current Arcade hardware, the Lindbergh.  It was originally going to be based on the Xbox 360, but eventually became PC based instead.  In fact, also in 2004, Taito released their current arcade hardware which is also PC based..  PC based machines offered far more extensibility for upgrades and stacking processors..</p><p>That's kind of the same direction the shmup community has been going as well.  Independently developed PC shmups have really caught the eyes of many circles.  Especially the Toho Project, responsible for Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night.  I haven't played any of these though, unfortunately.</p><p>Anywho.. i guess we'll see where Shmups will find their home in this new generation.  Senko no Ronde is on the 360, Gradius VI is coming out on PS3..  all while the Wii might be the best home with low publishing costs and a very retro community fanbase.  Most shmups these past years have found themselves on the PS2 because of how popular it is, rather than how identical the hardware is to its' original.  I'm sure that'll be the same in the coming years.</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming American Shmup Releases</b></div><p>April 17th.  Raiden III on Playstation 2 for $30<br/>April 27th.  Radilgy (Radio Allergy) on Gamecube for $30<br/>May 22nd.  Senko no Ronde (WarTech) on Xbox 360 for $60 ...  ugh :/<br/>Soon.  Ikaruga on Xbox Live Marketplace.</p><p>... and probably some other ones too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to End Gen Dreamcast" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/end-gen-dreamcast">End Gen Dreamcast</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 15, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On January 31st, 2001, Sega announced that they would discontinue the Dreamcast and would focus on 3rd Party support for other home consoles instead.  The Dreamcast had a very short life which began in November 1998 in Japan, and September 9th, 1999 in America.  In February 2002, NHL 2k2 was the last game released in America..  However, life continues to grow in small reaches thanks its initial purpose and devoted fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallel Arcade Development</b></div><p>The Sega Saturn was really the first instance of Sega developing their home console along-side arcade Hardware.  In 1994, Sega released the Saturn in Japan, alongside their ST-V arcade hardware.  Since the hardware was nearly identical, games arcade games developed for ST-V could be ported near exactly.  Fans could play exact copies of arcade games on their home console.  The other difference was that ST-V arcade units took huge clunky cartridges, while the Saturn took standard CDs.</p><p>The Saturn was initially flawed due to its emphasis on 2D graphics, and last minute 3D graphical additions.  2D games looked amazing, but the populous was captivated by the 3D marvels other consoles and arcade hardware provided.  Sega lost support, but they learned from their mistakes... sort of.</p><p>Sega began development of the Naomi arcade boards, to be far more versatile.  The <b>N</b>ew <b>A</b>rcade <b>O</b>peration <b>M</b>achine <b>I</b>dea was developed with both 2D and 3D in mind.  Boards were set up to process in parallel, so you could just add another board and increase processing power.  (and) Machines were fitted to read from GD-Roms, Sega's proprietary disc format.  GD-Roms were just normal CD-Roms except data was compacted together for optimal storage capacity.  A normal 700mb disc, could hold up to 1.2gb of data.</p><p>This was extremely flexible for the developers..  The could now produce discs to distribute their games, rather than cartridges..  something the console industry had already been doing at this time.</p><p>The Dreamcast is a lone Naomi board, squished into a plastic case, ready for sale to the mass public.  In 1998, Sega released both the Naomi boards and the Dreamcast in Japan.  (and then) The Dreamcast pretty much died in 2002.  Few games released, first party support dropped, and a very healthy alternative: Playstation 2.  However, it was their Naomi boards that continue to spur life on thanks to a healthy underground game genre.</p><div class='title'><b>Shmups</b></div><p>Shmups is an audible abbreviation for Shoot 'em ups, or Shooters.  Such famous shmups include 1941, Defender, Gallaga, Asteroids, Gradius..  Games that involve some sort of airplane or space ship, dodging enemy fire and other obstacles, while shooting up enemies.  Shmups were somewhat mainstream when gameplay and graphics were simply, but began to go underground when mainstream games began to offer more.</p><p>Anyways..  Shmup companies turned to the Naomi boards for their cheap development and production costs, as well as, ease of porting to a home console.  Shmup companies continued to develop Naomi games and subsequently release them on the Dreamcast even after the consoles death.  Since 2003, the Dreamcast has had 9 shmup releases: Shikigami no Shiro 2, Psyvariar 2, Border Down, Chaos Field, Trizeal, Radilgy, Under Defeat, Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica..  as well as some hentai releases.</p><p>These Dreamcast games would not have been possible if not for the Naomi boards and the devoted fans of the Shmup community.  In fact, such after death support began to reach enough demand for Sega to re-release some Dreamcast units in 2006, packaged with Radilgy.</p><p>Most of these after-death titles have been ported to other consoles, and thanks to O3 (Sega's unofficial private US publishing company) some have even come to the states.  Chaos Field was released in America in Feb 2005 on the Gamecube..  Currently, O3 is bringing over Radilgy on Gamecube posed to release at the end of April.  They renamed in Radio Allergy, though</p><div class='title'><b>The Dreamcast lives on..  kinda<br/></b></div><p>Man..  my Dreamcast has seen better days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" /></p><p>One day when I tried playing Crazy Taxi, the disc would scrape along the tray cover.  I took it upon myself to fix this problem..  so I took off the case, tightened some screws, and reassembled it.  Well...  the CD had plenty of room to spin around, but the Dreamcast always thought the tray was open.  When I reassembled it, the tray no longer hit the little lever in the back :/  Nothing a little tape won't fit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" /></p><p>To play import games on my Dreamcast, i need a boot disc.  Something that took about 5 minutes of googling, and another 5 minutes of burning to accomplish.  When completely screwed together, my Dreamcast thinks the tray is either closed or open..  It can't detect open/close functionality..  So i help it along..  no biggie.  Thus my Dreamcast looks like Dreamcastenstien.  It has life..!  I have given it life..!</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>Throughout my travels across the earth, across the country, and across the internet, I've found myself in the position of purchasing the 3 most recent Dreamcast games:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" /></p><p>Under Defeat, Karous, and Trigger Heart Exelica, in order of release date..  After the Dreamcast Rerelease in 2006, They began publishing games with DVD style cases rather than CD cases.</p><p>So...  Are these games actually worth it?  well... here's what i think:</p><div class='title'><b>Under Defeat (Limited)</b></div><p>Originally released in early 2006, I found this game from <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/" title="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</a>.  I wasn't really sure if i was seeing it correctly, but they actually had copies of the Limited Edition version which came with the soundtrack.  I had heard Under Defeat was an amazing game, so i decided to order it.  Also, i think someone said the Limited version was super crazy rare, so that was also a deciding factor.</p><p>Under Defeat is developed by G.rev, which was founded by several Taito employees who had developed G Darius.  G.rev's notable works include Border Down, also on Dreamcast after its death.  G.rev is also noted for working with Treasure on their development of Ikaruga and Gradius V, two of the best shooters ever made.</p><p>Under Defeat does not disappoint.  You pilot a German attack helicopter in a modern version of World War II.  The helicopter will rotate right and left when you move allowing you to fire at an angle rather than straight on the whole time.  You get 3 bombs to start off with that launch an air strike upon the ground..</p><p>The little bit of innovation comes into, what they call, an option.  When you hold your fire long enough, a little green bar will fill up in the lower left hand corner.  When it flashes OK, you can begin firing again, and you'll release a little pod which will fire upon your opponents.  You can grab other power-ups that will change its weapon: Vulcan, Cannon and Rocket (from weakest and frequent to strongest and less frequent).</p><p>All kills this little guy acquires will net you double points.. and Therein lies the secret to obtaining massive points: Have the option kill as many high point gainers as possible..  especially laying the final blow on bosses.</p><p>The gameplay is very easy to pick up since it is rather basic..  The sounds and graphics add that extra icing on the cake that makes this game great fun.  The game plays 2D, but the graphics are in full 3D featuring rich textures and distinguishable colors and models to make enemies noticable and prominent.  Bullets are pretty easy to spot too.</p><p>Stylistically, smoke and explosions plays a extra role..  Whenever you fire a bullet a little bit of smoke emits from your cannon.  The Bullet flies through the air and hit your target with a little bit of smoke residue.  When enemies die, there's a little bit of pause as its engulfed in flames and bursts from explosion.  The fiery orange sparks from the enemy but is sharply over powered by black smoke.  The smoke stays in the air, and eventually fades away from the sky..   Sometimes, if you aren't heavily shooting up an enemy it'll blow up a little and fall to the earth underneath emitting a smoke trailed descent.  Another explosion results in the impact, with more smoke.</p><p>Under Defeat is an amazing joy to play, albeit just a little bit difficult.  I would definitely recommend any casual fan of the shooter genre to check out this game.  Much like Border Down, it will most likely stay on the Dreamcast, so if you do find a copy online for around $50, that will probably be the cheapest you'll get it for.</p><p>Buy from import retailers who support these companies by buying their products in the first place.  With out community support, we wouldn't even have these games at all.  In fact, Ncsx still has copies of the LE version in stock: http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/T-46704M.html  .. if you're a fan and you have the money, i'd say it's worth it.  Then you can say, "Yes..  i am responsible for the Dreamcast refusing to die."</p><div class='title'><b>More to come...</b></div><p>I'll get my impression of the Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica up in the next couple of days.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS - 24 Game Game Wallet" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-24-game-game-wallet">DS - 24 Game Game Wallet</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It's that DS case i ordered when someone mentioned it in <a href="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937" title="http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=127937">this thread</a> on Cheap Ass Gamer.</p><p>I had been looking for a DS game case that could hold a large amount of DS carts for a while now.  When i first started buying DS games, i needed something to hold them in..  I mean, you can't carry around the game boxes because they're too bulky, and you can't carry the cartridge itself for fear of damage.  I first ran across <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do" title="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do"><br/>these cases</a> at Best Buy and they worked great when i owned 6 or 7 games, but when my game library grew, i needed more room.</p><p>I looked far and wide, but could not find anything as compact and portable as those 3 game shells.  I came across something similar on the internet, which held 6 games instead of 3, but i could not find anywhere to purchase such game case.  When i first got to Japan, it was easy to find <a href="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html" title="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html">this great case</a>.  This case is AS compact as the 3 game case and also comes in different colors and the game snaps into the case, rather than float around with the 3 game case.</p><p>This still hadn't solved my problem though.  My DS library had gotten up to the 20 range, and 3 little 3-game cases and a 6-er wasn't going to hold all my games.</p><p>When i saw this 24 game case on CAG, it only took a little googling to find <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">their website</a> and <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012">their product</a>.  Only 10 whole $.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07894.webp" /></p><p>This case is pretty slick.

Each page is slick plastic vinyl that couldn't possibly damage the game cart.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07896.webp" /></p><p>It certainly looked like this Penguin case would solve my problem of tooo many little cases and consolidate the bulk of my little collection in one easy to carry around case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07898.webp" /></p><p>The DS games slide in sideways, making the case viewable in a landscape view.  The pages are quite sleak and clean that the game slides right in without and resistance and damage to the game.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07899.webp" /></p><p>5 minutes later, i stuffed most of my games into the case.  My collection has gone beyond 24 games, so there's not much you can do there.  My 6 game case can still hold the games i'm using most often, since it's quite portable.  Those crappy Kanji games can sit in that 3 game case for all i care.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070402_dswallet/DSC07900.webp" /></p><p>huzzah.  That huge mess of games has been consolidated down in one shiny penguin white and grey pack.  Just as easy to transport as my DS and my 6 pack.</p><p>I'd say that anyone with a decent amount of DS games, should definitely own one of these things.  It's rather appauling the most popular gaming system of 2006, and potentially of all-time, has dick for portable game storage to complement it's portable play.  It took independent game accessory maker, <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">Penguin United</a> to solve this annoying problem finally.</p><p>After looking through their site a little more, i think i'll probably order this <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011">Wii-mote Charger Stand</a> next, since one of my Wii-motes has ran out of batteries, and i don't plan on buying new batteries each time this happens.</p><p>Wheee<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to DS - Contact" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ds-contact">DS - Contact</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| March 26, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Contact was released by Atlus in the states around the middle of september last year.  Sadly, I missed this release by a couple days when my plane left for planet japan.  I picked it up about a week before my next trip to japan, so I would have plenty of time to devote to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Contact follows the mis-adventure of the professor.  The professor ship had been shot by another spaceship knocking his energy crystals to the earth.  As he crashes to earth his path is crossed with our main character, Terry.  The professor plucks Terry from his daily life and pulls him into the conflict.  Now Terry will help reclaim these crystals as you guide him!</p><div class='title'><b>Art Style</b></div><p>What initially drew me to Contact was the art style.  The world of contact uses vibrant colors in fairly realistically concepted environments.  As a contrast, the world of the professor is a 16 bit throw back.  In essence Terry lives in the graphical age of today's sprite world; whereas, is stuck back on super nintendo.  When playing Contact, the professor's 16 bit world is always on top commenting on Terry's action while you guide Terry in the real world below.</p><div class='title'><b>Oh Comedy</b></div><p>The professor may seem stuck in the past, but he's pretty up on the internet.  The game manual is page after page of his live journal entries.  The real comedy gold are the references in his comments, though they do become quite short and repetitive.  Occasionally when you kill something easy, he'll say 'weaksauce.'  When you traverse the military compound, he'll make an 'all your base' reference.</p><p>The comedy is undoubtedly Contact's greatest appeal.  The story itself hasn't gone anywhere in the 5 hours i've played.  It seems to just fuel the game and push it along.  I mean, all you do is go around finding these crystals.  Then again, I had spent some time just leveling and killing townspeople.</p><div class='title'><b>Leveling</b></div><p>Anywho, Contact follows a very MMO style leveling system, as each individual skill is leveled and trained, rather than a set amount of experience.  You have all the normal rpg skills such as strength, stamina, wisdom, and defense, but weapon and magic skills are individual.  You have separate levels for swords, hand-to-hand, and blunt objects; likewise, earth, water, wind and fire elements are separate.  Leveling is pretty easy though..  You just need to use 'em.</p><p>There are other skills to level such as cooking and lock picking.  These skills are specific to the clothes that you wear, which replaces traditional style armor.  Each set of clothes have separate attributes, such as increased evade, increased strength.. But also associated abilities, like cooking and lock picking.  Clothes aren't usually found in chests or markets, though.  They generally require some sort of unlocked event or difficult optional battle.</p><p>Weapons and Clothes aren't the only stat increases.  Replacing a traditional accessory system, Contact has decals.  There are some key 'itemed' key decals, which are different, but you may equip 4 regular decals on Terry.  In the field you'll come across these decals as a '? Decal'.  In your menu, you use the stylus to peal off the decal to reveal it's true identity.  The usual ones i've run across have been stuff like Battle decal or Defense decal.  The stats they boost are drawn at random, so you can really buff up your character.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As for actual gameplay, Contact, once again, acts like an MMO.  You freely walk around, as do mobs.  Some mobs will attack you, while others will leave you alone or even run away.  Terry has a peace mode and a war mode.  While in war mode, you can point at which monsters Terry should vanquish.  You can also kill any npc you want, friend or foe.  One time I walked into a town.  The first guy said, 'hi. Welcome to our town.'  then I laid him to rest with my blade.</p><p>This is another whole aspect of Contact.  Terry can have a good alignment or an evil alignment depending on your decisions, much like Fable.  Killing baddies nets you brownie points, while the opposite does the opposite.  Luckily the game forgives one infraction each time.  It won't deduct negative alignment if your last kill was positive..  You have to do it twice in a row for that to happen.  Same with the other way..  It kinda works like tennis scoring.</p><p>Anyways, Terry also can come across spells and techniques to make life easier.  These use up EP (or whatever it's called) which is collected as you kill things.  Terry starts off with 5 max EP.  Most moves use up 1 or 2.</p><p>Running around killing monsters is pretty boring though.  You walk up to something, go into war mode, and let Terry attack away.  You can pull up the menu at any time and heal him though.  HOWEVER, this introduces another aspect.  You have a ba-zillion different things you can feed Terry to heal him, but some things will take longer to digest.  You can't feed a full stomach, so don't feed terry a bunch of 30HP hamburgers that'll take 5 minutes to get rid of.</p><p>Anywho, killing mobs may be monotanous, but at least boss battles feature some interactivity.  The first boss is some rock monster that throw punches and boulders at you..  Both of which are pretty easy to dodge.  Unlike regular enemies and if you time it right, you can defeat a boss without taking a hit.  Huzzah..</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>Despite it's comedic appeal and depth of gameplay, it does get rather tedious.  Having 20 different adds a bit of depth to the game, but you have to spend some time leveling up all the stats.  It probably wouldn't be so bad, if the gameplay offered more than just going into killing mode to fight.  Some more action style moves would've broken this up..  9aybe they thought they added too much complexity already..  I haven't even touched the cooking part of the game.</p><p>At the moment I cannot definitely recommend this game one way or the other.  I'd need to spend more time to see where the story actually goes..  Though given, the current situations, you probably eventually fight the opposing forces and save the day and the comedy probably won't go any further than the comments the professor makes.</p><p>It's kind of a little gaming gem, but overall, you won't miss it.  Oh well....<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Game Library" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/game-library">Game Library</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I thought it was pretty neat.  You can see what people are actually buying, rather than look at sales numbers or just what people are complaining about, or simply what they are playing.</p><p>Concurrently to this, personally, i've been keeping track of all the games i own for well over a year.  I think i inventoried all my games around the Summer of 2004, or sometime in that Fall season.  Actually, maybe it was that christmas break.  Some people at SPAMM had their own game lists, and i knew my game library kicked the ass out of their game library.  So i cataloged.</p><p>Here's the old one: <a href="/pages/games/games2.html" title="/pages/games/games2.html">http://www.theschlock.com/misc/games2.html</a>.  It worked out pretty well.  All the code is stuffed into one html file, which makes updating and upkeep rather easy.</p><p>Of course, no one really gave a shit..  None the less, i kept it updated and linked it from Cheap Ass Gamer like a bunch of other gaming nerds do.</p><p>In recently months, i had actually been doing something similar to what the NeoGAFers had been doing, but only in comment form..  If you view the source of that page, you'll notice after the more recently entries they have a '//added mm/dd/yyyy' after them.</p><p>I hadn't extended this idea to code or design, but that's what i did yesterday.  I think the NeoGAFers were onto something, so i took it and ran with it.</p><p>Here's the new games list: <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/games2.html</a>.</p><p>The games2.html page is pretty much the same.  The only thing i did was pull out most of the javascript and css into their own files for the other page to share..  <a href="/pages/games/lst/sales.html" title="/pages/games/lst/sales.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/sales.html</a> is the new file that extends my games list with all my recent purchases.  I also took the idea a little further by adding where i bought the game, and how much it cost.</p><p>Even though, i could probably go back a couple months and fill in information, i think i'm just going to pitch March 2007 as my starting point.  That way it'll be 100% correct, rather than missing a few pieces.</p><p>In the future, it might be fun to start adding in statistic gathering and create Trend graphs and the like.  Before that, i should probably update this with server-side scripting so it loads as fast as possible.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Trauma Center Wii" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/trauma-center-wii">Trauma Center Wii</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 20, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As indicated by the previous articles, a couple of weeks ago i purchased a Wii.  A thread on Cheap Ass Gamer stated that Wal*mart was holding on their shipment of Wii to be released on that coming Sunday.  So, that sunday, i woke up at stupid o'clock in the morning, put on my jacket and drove over to Wal*mart.  It was only 5 minutes away from my house anyways.</p><p>I got their 15 minutes before they opened, and received the number 17 to indicate my place in line.  Apparently, this was more well known than i thought.  They had plenty of Wii machines to go around, though.  I got home and went back to bed for a little while.  Later on that day, we hooked it up and started messing around with Wii Sports, but got bored of it.  I wanted something fun to play that took advantage of the Wii-mote's capabilities.</p><p>I went out and picked up Trauma Center as my first Wii title.  I thought this was rather nostalgic since Trauma Center was also the first title i purchased for my DS.  I got home, put it in, and started to play.</p><p>For some reason, i thought this was a brand new game.  Since the full title of the game is "Trauma Center: Second Opinion", i thought that meant this was Trauma Center 2.  They couldn't really make a sequel of Trauma Center DS, but they could've had more doctors in other parts of the Trauma Center universe.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trauma Center Wii is a port of the DS title.  The story, characters and surgeries are the same fun missions you tackled on the portable venue.  How disappointing..</p><p>They did add another character at the last minute.  When you complete a story arc, you unlock another story with another character.  These missions take full advantage of the Wii controller.  In the first mission, you twist the Wii-mote to place a shattered broken bone back together.</p><p>On its' own, Trauma Center really starves the player.  The gameplay really lends itself to an Arcade setting, but the bulk of time spent in game is reading character dialogue.  The player sits through boring text until they finally get to experience the action and fast-paced setting of the surgery gameplay.  As far as i know, you can't skip this dialogue..  i should look into that.  Unfortunately, if they removed all story and just had a bunch of surgeries, the game wouldn't have any depth.</p><p>The gameplay is where Trauma Center really shines.  You have several different tools that you switch back and forth through while performing the surgery as outlined in the dialogue.</p><p>I'm not really sure which version of Trauma Center i prefer.  In the DS version, you have the extra precision of pinpoint pen strokes on the touch screen, but with the Wii version you have the speed and agility of an extra controller to switch between instruments.</p><p>There are other little differences as well.  On the Wii version, you actually use the defibrillators rather than the nurse automatically doing it for you.  Using the healing touch i've found to be much more difficult, but i think i just need to get used to the timing.</p><p>Anywho, i do love Trauma Center, but there are many downfalls that make it difficult to recommend to people.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Twilight Princess (3)" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/twilight-princess-3">Twilight Princess (3)</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| February 19, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend, i finally came across Twilight Princess on the Wii for a cheapy price tag, so i picked it up.  Thinking back, i'm not really sure why.  In the past two months i've started 6 games that i have not finished.  These games would be Portrait of Ruin on DS, Final Fantasy XII on PS2, Cooking Mama on DS, Hotel Dusk on DS, Trauma Center on Wii, and Picross DS on DS.  I've been playing Picross quite a bit, but the other games are becoming lost causes..  Starting ANOTHER game would be foolish right?</p><p>Whatever..  i want a fun Wii game that i can sink time into.  I like the Wii quite a bit, but i'm stuck in Trauma Center, and Wii Sports and Wii Play don't really hold my interest.  The only other game i play quite a bit on my Wii is Gunstar Heroes, but i'm getting my assed kicked on Level 5.</p><p>Anyways..  i bought Wii Twilight Princess and started playing it yesterday.  There's a pretty stunning difference between the gamecube version and the wii version of the game, which everyone already knows about.  Traditionally Link is a left-handed sword wielder, but the vast majority of earth's population are right-handed sword wielders.  Rather than re-code Link's physics or model, they decided to mirror the entire game.  In other words, Right is Left and Left is Right.  Now link is right-handed... i guess.</p><p>I didn't think this would really bother me at all, but i find myself getting lost every now and then when i'm trying to find a house or navigate throughout the world.  Dungeons are pretty easy though, since i hadn't spent nearly the amount of time i have in villages or the world overall.</p><p>The obvious difference is most certainly the controls.  I'm not a big fan of the Wii controls.  Aiming with the slingshot, boomerang, etc is FAR better with the Wii-mote, but sword play is way too flexible.  On Gamecube Twilight Princess, you just hit the B button to slash and beat up things, but on the Wii you swing the Wii-mote back and forth motion which loses a lot of precision.  It's far worse than using an analog PS2 controller for a fighter..  The jousting event took me about half an hour to finally figure out when the sword actually swings when i jerk the Wii-mote to the side.  With the Gamecube controller, you hit the button and Link swings the sword right then.  Precision is key when you come to events based on timing and the Wii-mote doesn't offer that type of precision.  I eventually figured it out, though ^_^</p><p>The other thing that annoys me is the lack of camera views in the Wii version.  On the Gamecube controller the C-button left and right would move the camera left and right.  The C-button up and down would pull and push the camera away from and towards Link.  Unless i'm missing it, there is no camera movement in the Wii version at all.  I've been using the Z button to correct the camera's placement.</p><p>They should've used the D-pad for the view changing, but ended up using that to store weapons.  In this way, Link can have 4 total weapons out at once rather than 3 in the Gamecube version.  The Wii controller is a little disadvantage for button mapping though.  Both controllers have 8 buttons, an analog stick and a D-pad, but the Wii controller lacks that C-button stick on the Gamecube controller.  So, rather than code around this problem, it seems that they just omitted camera controls from the game.</p><p>Unless i'm missing something..  I'm probably missing something..  maybe you can do Camera control with the B button on the Wii.  I dunno..  i'll try that out tonight.  oh wait...  B button is for items..  i shall consult the instruction manual.</p><p>Anyways, I still prefer the Gamecube version of Twilight Princess for a few reasons.  1) It was designed and developed to take advantage of the Gamecube, whereas the Wii is just a port.  The whole mirrored world thing is pure proof of that, which removes the traditional left-handed Link.  2) The sword swinging feels too loose, and lacks the precision that a simple button push provides on the Gamecube.  and 3) I'm probably bias towards the Gamecube version because i played through it before the Wii version.</p><p>I dunno.  I think that if i had played the Wii version first, i probably would've liked the feel of the controller better, but be annoyed about the aiming schema. :shrugs:  I guess we'll see what happens...  It's still the great amazing game you must play if you own a Gamecube or a Wii.  Quite possibly the BEST gamecube game ever made. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/24">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/22">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
