| October 19, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On Tuesday, Fable II finally is released.  A game that I was once very much looking forward to.  But the more and more of this game I expose myself to, the more and more I cannot bring myself to hand over $60 or $70 dollars to purchase.</p><div class='title'><b>Thinking back to Fable</b></div><p>Fable was one of my favorite original Xbox games.  I have that thought in my head.  I really liked Fable.  But, why did I like Fable?  Oh right.  Because the game was completely ridiculous.  Because the English accents made me laugh every time dialogue was spoken.  Because I ate a bunch of pies and ran around as a huge fat guy.</p><p>I loved it for it's B-movie qualities.  There were plenty of them.  But that's really the extent of Fable's quality.  The game is shallow and tedious, quite frankly.  It made me laugh because it was so moronic.</p><p>Would I pay $60 or $70 to be amused again by the same train wreck?  Hell no.  The memories are fond, but only because the price of entry was trivial.  I think I paid $20 for Fable and It was absolutely worth it.  Another Fable-like experience is not worth the high price of HD gaming.  It's worth $30 at best.</p><div class='title'><b>Playing Fable at PAX</b></div><p>But times change, right?  Peter Moyneux (creator of Fable) has apologized for the mistakes made in Fable and says that he's learned from them.  Fable II is fable done right.  Honestly, there are tons of problems with what I played at The Penny Arcade Expo, if that was representative of the final product: <a href="/old/v7/pax-fable-ii-hands-on" title="/pax-fable-ii-hands-on">http://www.theschlock.com/blog/?p=476</a></p><p>The graphics were horrible.  The speed was slow.  The fighting felt a tad unresponsive.  It also felt more like a hack 'n slash loot fest than an Action RPG.  And that'd be fine if I found it fun to play.  But what I played was boring and derivative.  It took resolve to make it to the end of the demo.  And I'm not going to pay $60 - $70 to play more of that shit.</p><div class='title'><b>The first 10 minutes</b></div><p>Kotaku posted an article today with a video of the first 10 minutes of Fable 2.  Some polish website has a copy of the game committed it to the internet: <a href="http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish" title="http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish">http://kotaku.com/5065434/the-first-10-minutes-of-fable-2-albeit-in-polish</a></p><p>That certainly brings back memories from Fable.  The goofy English accents and dim-witted humor.  But after playing Dead Space all weekend long, this feels cheap.  It feels like a joke.  And I'd feel like I'm at the butt of that joke for paying full price.  Dead Space is a fine polished work of atmospheric art.  Fable II looks bargin bin.</p><div class='title'><b>However...</b></div><p>One thing Fable II does have going for it is Online Co-op.  All my friends are interested in this game and have pre-ordered it.  So it gives me the chance to play games with friends!  I'm just going to clear out my gamefly list and have Fable II as the only entry.  That should guarantee that my next game will be Fable II and hopefully my friends haven't beaten the game by the time I get it.</p><p>Hell, If Fable II turns out to be alright.  I can choose the "keep it" option from Gamefly, and it'll only cost me $30, most likely.</p><div class='title'><b>Other upcoming games</b></div><p>As inferred, I bought Dead Space this week and Love it.  This week is Fable II.  Also this week is the new Castlevania on DS.  Next week is Fallout 3.  November 11th is Mirror's Edge!</p><p>I can't wait for Mirror's Edge ^_^.  I wrote about it back on <a href="/old/v7/free-running-game" title="/free-running-game">July 17th</a> during E3 week and then played it on <a href="/old/v7/pax-mirrors-edge-hands-on" title="/pax-mirrors-edge-hands-on">September 1st</a> at PAX.  On November 6th, they will be a demo on both consoles.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Brodeo is Over" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-brodeo-is-over">The Brodeo is Over</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 18, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At work, my ears have a lot of free time. My eyes, my hands and my head is pretty engaged with what is going on, but my ears only get to do something when talking with coworkers. So I listen to a lot of music and podcasts. Usually back and forth between the two, rather than a mix. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for music. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for talking and chatter. My job goes back and forth between planning and execution constantly, so it's a great way to keep the boring execution phase of my job lively.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" /></p><p>My favorite podcast shuts down its doors today, and that is the Brodeo aka GFWRadio formerly CGWRadio. The Brodeo starred the editors of Games For Windows Magazine formerly Computer Gaming World, who were Jeff Green, Ryan Scott, Shawn Elliot and Sean Malloy with Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.</p><p>CGWRadio began on February 16th, 2006. The first couple episodes were a little odd, but they eventually figured it out. On August 8th, 2006, they announced that CGW would become GFW and in November launched their first issue.</p><p>GFWRadio combined a unique brand of gaming humor with the trials and annoyances of working in the gaming journalism business and the joy of being in the business.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>After listening to GFWRadio, I never thought I'd have such an insight into the gaming media. This type of perspective is something that I never even thought about 4 years ago being a gamer. 4 years ago, I was still writing about games, but I never had the insight as to what the game's designers were thinking about, what the publishers were doing to promote the game, and what really went into making the game to begin with. I know so much more now-a-days about the pressures these publishing companies put on game reviews and journalists on exactly what they say about a game.</p><p>They also talked a lot about the themes in games and what the game really meant to them and wouldn't pull any punches. They'd give you their complete honesty opinion on what the game did right and what the game did wrong. They'd also completely deconstruct some games talking about character interaction, plot devices and themes.</p><p>Discussions on GFWRadio were a good balance between these industry related topics, and high-brow video game analysis, but weren't afraid to go completely low-brow too and talk about stupid things they do or have done. It's really just a bunch of guys bullshitting about their jobs, lives and games they play.</p><p>That's really where the term <b>Brodeo</b> came from. Jeff Green was browsing around Urban Dictionary and found this definition: <em>A get-together or a party where the attendance is predominantly male.</em> He brought it up on the podcast and the cult following of GFWRadio labeled it as such.</p><p>The real humor of the show came from "Hero's of the Web", Dramatic Readings, Stories of griefing and gaming, and other coined terms, segments and jokes that became running gags.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>April 8th, 2008 marked the beginning of the end as Ziff Davis put a hard start to Games For Windows Magazine. Actually, I suppose, Ziff Davis declaring bankruptcy was really the beginning of the end. But shifting from a print magazine to the online space wasn't really something the GFW editors had been prepared for.</p><p>I wish I would've evangelized this podcast more when it was in its prime, but oh well. Popularity is not the reason it's ending. It's ending because the key voices of the show have now gone on to do bigger and better things.</p><p>In June, Sean Malloy announced that he had gotten a job for Blizzard and left 1up. Last week, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and he left to work on the Sims with Maxis and EA. And this week, Shawn Elliot finishes up the Brodeo and heads off to 2K Boston to work with Ken Levine (creator of Bioshock) on his next project.</p><p>Ryan Scott, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos are still at 1up and have said that they'll continue to podcast in some form or do something, but the actual Brodeo, has ended.</p><p>Times change. Jobs change. People grow up. You complete college, you gotta move on. You get your first job or your break in the Industry. You usually start at the same place many other begin as well. Eventually, you gotta move up in the Industry. So that's basically it.</p><p>A lot of voices have moved on from 1up, but there's plenty of new voices as well. With the Brodeo gone, I think I'll turn my attention to 1up FM, 1up's new podcast.</p><p>My hope is for a GFW Reunion at PAX 2009. ^_^ It was neat meeting Shawn Elliot at PAX, but I really didn't get to say too much to him.</p><div class='title'><b>Errata</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, You guys should definitely check out all the previous episodes of CGW/GFWRadio, which are hosted at <a href="https://archive.org/details/GFWRadioCollection" title="https://archive.org/details/GFWRadioCollection">archive.org</a>. I'm not really sure which would be the best to begin at. Probably around May 2006, if you plan to go the full distance.</p><p>Also, last week's podcast, Jeff Green's final podcast can be found in its entirety on video.

Hahah. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure why you'd really want World of Warcraft: Wraith of the Lich King on a playable kiosk, anyways.  All you'd really want to show off is the Death Knight and some of the new areas.  For a little while, I watched one guy play and he was a Gnome Warrior running around...  What a waste of time.  They did have some demonstrations of Lich King, though, so it wasn't all a waste.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX: Spore Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-spore-impressions">PAX: Spore Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

DC ready for play.  Each game had 10 playable characters: 5 MK characters and 5 DC characters.  On the Mortal Kombat side, you could fight as Scorpion, Subzero, Shang Tsung, Kitana, and...  someone else.  Maybe Liu Kang.  For DC, you could choose Superman, Batman, Cat Woman, The Flash or The Joker.</p><p>Nearly everyone playing choose a DC character.  That makes sense though.  The DC characters are new to the franchise, whereas Scorpion and Subzero have been there since the beginning.  We want to try out new things, rather than simply win the fight.</p><p>I was tempted to choose Superman, but I fought as The Flash since he seemed more my style of fighting character.  Fast quick flurry of moves, and ease of getting into combat and fleeing quickly.  Five choose Kitana, who no one really used at all.  Equal Opportunity!</p><p>After a heated awkward battle, I barely won after learning a neat move or two.</p><p>There really isn't much to say about MK v. DC other than, yes, it <i>is</i> definitely Mortal Kombat.  When fighting as The Flash, it felt like another move-set for an MK character, but with Superhero-like moves.  I think they did a great job pulling the DC Superheroes into the Mortal Kombat universe...  other than the exception that any character can defeat Superman.  I think that's bullshit, but you can't have a DC game without Superman.  Oh well.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun. ^_^  Once again, it reminds me of playing fighting games back at the SPAMM haus.  There were those couple of months we played Mortal Kombat V on the Gamecube.  It'll make a great addition to any circle of friend's nightly gaming session.  But, for me, I think I'll stick with Soul Caliber IV.  Mortal Kombat does not compare to the depth and artistic quality of Soul Caliber.<br/>____</p><p>It should be noted that Mortal Kombat v.
