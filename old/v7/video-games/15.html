| June 3, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>For the grand finale of Nintendo's Press Conference yesterday, Reggie asked the rhetorical questions, "Could a new edgier game, also be coming from us? ...  We've partnered with a development team with a <em>proven track record</em> in the <em>mature</em> space to give us a <em>fresh take</em> at a <em>storied</em> franchise. .. Here's the preview."</p><p>They rolled the clip, which immediately began with Team Ninja's company intro.  "Project M presents" emerges from a space field of meteors.  "Project M" had been a secret project or team floating around the Wii for a while.  Some stuff in the trailer happens, Samus appears, and title "Metroid Other M" materializes before our eyes.</p><p>Even though most people figured that the M in "Project M" probably stood for Metroid rather than Mario, it's nice to see some confirmation. ^_^  But the addition of Team Ninja is a bit of a shocker.  Team Ninja is about as un-Nintendo as you can get.  They're the development team behind such hits as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive series.  They pride themselves on flashy over-the-top Anime-style action gameplay and sequence.  Where as Nintendo is pretty traditional and conservative about their games.  I don't think you could get a "fresh"er look than that.</p><p>The trailer showed a whole lot of action with Samus flipping and hopping around the areas physically beating up enemies, as well as firing them down with her plasma gun.  The trailer also showed several clips of full-fledged cutscenes, which is something Metroid has never done before.</p><p>My immediate gut reaction was not very pleasant.  The Metriod series has always stood for exploration. Adding in all these action sequences feels like they're cheapening the name.</p><div class='title'><b>To the rescue!</b></div><p>Luckily, Jeremy Parish conducted an interview with Team Ninja's Yusuke Hayashi and Project M's Yoshio Sakamoto and asked the hard hitting questions: <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587" title="http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587">http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3174587</a></p><p>His asked a question that dug into the heart of what I wanted to know.  "How do your two completely different game design patterns fit together and still keep Metroid faithful?"  They assured Parish, that Metroid Other M is definitely an exploratory game.  It's just the fire fights have been choreographed with the precision we'd expect from Team Ninja.</p><p>Having Project M head the actual game planning put me at ease about the whole Team Ninja thing.  It sounds like they've wanted to (or were pushed into) develop a "true" 3D Metroid game, but had a little trouble with how they were to implement they actual gameplay.  That's where Team Ninja helped them out. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>Parish went on to ask Sakamoto about where Other M falls into the Metriod timeline, to which he replied, "It's part of the flow, story-wise, between Super Metroid and Fusion."  Which makes sense since the trailer ends with a cinematic of the final scene of Super Metroid.</p><p>The actual chronological order of the Metroid games is all over the map.  It's used to be so easy, but then Metroid Prime was thrown in the mix between Metroid 1 and 2... and then the subsequent releases could do whatever they wanted.</p><p>Here's what it looks like now, as taken from the <a href="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline" title="http://metriod.wikia.com/wiki/Metroid_timeline">Metroid Wikia</a>:</p><p>Metroid (NES, 1986) / Metroid Zero Mission (GBA, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime (GC, 2002)<br/>Metroid Prime Hunters (DS, 2006)<br/>Metroid Prime 2 (GC, 2004)<br/>Metroid Prime 3 (Wii, 2007)<br/>Metroid 2 (GB, 1991)<br/>Super Metroid (Snes, 1994)<br/><b>Metroid Other M</b> (Wii, 2010)<br/>Metroid Fusion (GBA, 2002)</p><div class='title'><b>Project M explained</b></div><p>To end with, Sakamoto returns to explain what is Project M.  It turns out that Project M is a collaboration of 3 companies working on Other M.  There's the Nintendo team, headed by Yoshio Sakamoto, co-creator of the Metroid series.  There's Team Ninja, headed by Yusuke Hayashi.  And a Third team responsible for the cinematic and game visuals.</p><div class='title'><b>Crisis Averted</b></div><p>After reading that interview, I'm totally excited for Metroid Other M.  It's a new Metroid game designed by the core Metroid team!  Finally!</p><p>Though, they've mentioned Metroid Fusion quite a bit in this Interview.  When released, Metroid Fusion  had some mediocre reviews.  Personally, I never got around to playing it, but I've heard the progress is fairly linear.  Hopefully Metroid Other M will stick to its full exploratory roots that they claim it will.</p><div class='title'><b>The sequel curse</b></div><p>Come to think of it, the Metroid series has a very interesting patterns emerging from its sequels, not unlike the Star Trek series.  All the odd numbered releases are amazing, but the even releases miss the point, or aren't as fun.  Let's see here...</p><p>1986: Metroid 1 ++ new and different!<br/>1991: Metroid 2 -- linear and weird<br/>1994: Super Metroid ++ Best game ever made<br/>2002: Metroid Fusion -- linear again and kinda weird<br/>2002: Metroid Prime ++ Fresh!<br/>2004: Metroid Prime 2 -- horribly unoriginal and dumb<br/>2004: Metroid Zero Mission ++ Excellent!<br/>2006: Metroid Prime Hunters -- forgotten and weird<br/>2007: Metroid Prime 3 ++ Not Bad!<br/>2010: Metroid Other M +/-  thumbs down?!</p><p>So...  does that mean in 2010 we'll be dissapointed?  Pfft.. it's just a silly curse.  Star Trek XI (aka JJ Abrams' Star Trek) is an odd numbered Star Trek and it's pretty damn spiffy.  Curses are meant to be broken.  (or was that "promises are meant to be broken")<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games Games Games" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-games-games">Games Games Games</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 2, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>E3 has been fantastic so far, and today was an exceptional day for gamers.  Unlike <a href="/old/v7/its-all-melting-around-me" title="/its-all-melting-around-me">last year when the world was melting around me</a>, Nintendo and Sony had some substantial unveils and a fantastic line up of games.  There are some pretty great looking games coming out on all 3 console platforms and its gotten me excited about video games again!</p><div class='title'><b>Microsoft</b></div><p>From Microsoft's Press Conference <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> looked amazing.  That beginning scene of climbing up the side of a mountain is WORLDS beyond that horrible Modern Warfare 1 opening... ugh.  It's reminds me of the beginning of Mission Impossible 2 actually.  And Star Trek V, come to think of it.  Except you aren't on vacation.  You're scaling this mountain to join a fire fight that ends with a Snowmobile battle!  That totally looks like fun. ^_^</p><p>The next thing I found mildly exciting was the demonstration of <b>Halo Recon</b> (or ODST as they call it these days.)  Though, it's really more of the same.  Walking around, shooting up brutes and other aliens.  They announced <b>Halo Reach</b>, which is another Halo 3 prequel...  Solid Rental titles!</p><p>They also showed off Xbox Live's upcoming synergy with the online space and social networking including <b>Last.fm</b>, <b>Facebook</b>, and <b>Twitter</b>.  I really wonder how many gamers will be twittering and facebooking from their Xbox.  I'll probably hook up all my accounts to Live, but I doubt I'll actually use them after that initial hour.</p><p>And then Kojima came to the stage and announced <b>Metal Gear Solid Rising</b>, a Raiden centric Metal Gear game that leads into Metal Gear Solid 4.  Even though, it was announced for the Xbox, it's also coming to the Playstation, so that makes me happy. ^_^  The REAL megaton would've been if it were Xbox exclusive.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Microsoft showed off <b>Project Natal</b> which uses Camera motion sensing for input.  Instead of having a crappy motion controller, you use your arms, legs, and your entire body to do crap.  Why do we need this crap?  In addition, Peter Molyneux announced their Natal project entitled <b>Milo</b>.  Milo is a 13 year old boy that you talk and interact with.  Fucking creepy, if you ask me.</p><p>And they ended on that.  They showed off far more games than I described above including <b>Crackdown 2</b>, <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, <b>Alan Wake</b>, <b>Rockband: Beattles</b>, <b>Tony Hawk Ride</b> with that ridiculous skateboard controller, <b>Forza 3</b>, and a couple of other games.</p><p>All in all, I think Microsoft's conference was pretty solid.  They showed off a ton of games and some new stupid crap to boot!  They didn't show anything from Mass Effect 2 though...</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>Nintendo started right off the bat by announcing <b>New Super Mario Brothers Wii</b>, a 4 player co-op/competitive take on the 2006 DS game.  This game looks incredibly fun.  It's very much like Legend of Zelda 4 Swords, in which you have 4 players basically playing the same 2D game at the same time.  I can't wait to play this game at parties.</p><p>Then they went off on Wii Fit Plus and Wii Motion Plus and how 3rd Party adoption of Wii Motion Plus is great.  They showed off some RPGs.  Crystal Bearers on Wii looks a lot like Sin &amp; Punishment.  Mario &amp; Luigi RPG 3 was announced for America!  And Golden Sun DS!  They also mentioned <b>Zelda Train Simulator</b> in there somewhere.</p><p>Then they announced <b>Women's Murder Club: Games of Passion</b>, which sounds like an episode of the Red Shoe Diaries..  These are interactive novels written by James Patterson for the DS.  Sounds very interesting.</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Iwata got up on stage, talked for too long, and then unveiled something EVEN more bizarre than Project Natal, the <b>Wii Vitality Sensor</b>.  It's an accessory that you clip on your finger, and it monitors your heart rate.  Iwata mentioned no properties that used this, no gaming prospects, nothing!  "Look what we made!  It's a thing!"  Were they just going for the hat-trick of announcing 3 upcoming accessories for the Wii, or was there an actual purpose for unveiling this technology?!</p><p>Reggie returned to the stage and brought us all back to earth by announcing <b>Super Mario Galaxy 2</b>!  Really?!  Why?  Isn't it a little soon for another canon Mario game?  This reminds me a lot of Japanese Super Mario Bros 2 (aka Lost Levels), where they reused all the assets from the first game, and just added more levels.  I think Mario Galaxy 2 cheapens Mario Galaxy 1.  Which is unfortunate because Mario Galaxy is a <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-impressions" title="/super-mario-galaxy-impressions">fantastic</a> <a href="/old/v7/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts" title="/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts">achievement</a>.</p><p>Reggie continued by showing off their strong third party lineup including The Conduit, Resident Evil Dark Side Chronicles and Dead Space Extraction.</p><p>And then Reggie concluded with <b>Metroid Other M</b>, which I have mixed feelings about.  Metroid Other M is being developed by Team Ninja, creators of the new Ninja Gaiden series.  The trailer showed the prospects of a very story-centric Metroid mixed with a whole lot of action.  While I'm excited about Story returning to Metroid, which has been absent throughout Metroid Prime, I think the over-the-top action sequences will cheapen the depth of gameplay Metroid is known for.  We shall see....</p><p>Nintendo has a strong start and a strong finish, but it was so goddamn boring in the middle.  Still, they have a pretty decent lineup coming up.  They didn't announce Pikmin 3 nor Zelda Wii nor Kid Icarus.  Seriously though, why would they announce Zelda Wii when they've got Zelda Train Simulation coming up!  They'll announce it next year, and by then it'll almost be done!</p><div class='title'><b>Sony</b></div><p>Out of the big 3, I think Sony's brand is spread the furthest across gaming.  They have the Playstation 2, Playstation 3 and the PSP.</p><p>Well, they begin with some games.  Naughty Dog reps get up on stage and begin to demo <b>Uncharted 2</b>, which looks pretty nice.  The graphics have that very warm color palette that almost all PS3 exclusive titles have.  All the models are very solid and tangible.</p><p>The demo begins across some rooftops until they've discovered by a helicopter!  The helicopter opens fire and you're leaping from balcony to balcony, jumping away from gun fire, dodging bullets, while holding cover and blowing away some bad dudes...  This whole scene totally reminds me of the helicopter fight from Tomorrow Never Dies.  You escape into a building, but it's taken damage from the helicopter and eventually tumbles to the ground seconds after you leap out a window to safety!</p><p>I don't think I've ever seen an action sequence in a game so closely resemble something seen in an action movie.  That demo was incredible.  And Nathan Drake is hilarious as he makes subtle commentary during the fight scenes.</p><p>They showed off the new PSP, and some other games and eventually got to the new trailer for <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b>, with that absolutely fantastic battle music. Afterward, Jack Trenton starts talking about the "next" Final Fantasy game, which I assume is Final Fantasy XIII Versus, but he says <b>Final Fantasy XIV</b>.  What?!  Did I hear that right?  "Exclusive to Playstation 3 is Final Fantasy XIV, roll that beautiful bean footage!"</p><p>What the?!  Final Fantasy XIII isn't even out yet.  and Final Fantasy XIV is expected to release globally in 2010?!  At the end, the trailer says "Final Fantasy XIV Online", and everyone slaps their head, "D'oh!"  It's just the successor to Final Fantasy XI.  Well, hopefully it won't be as boring...</p><p>Then shit got weird...</p><p>Some Sony dudes get to the stage and unveil an accessory that is the spitting image of one of those "back massagers" that everyone uses as a vibrator.  I could hardly contain my laughter sitting at my desk at work.  "We want this device to be in the hands of our consumers." AHahahahahhaa</p><p>But the demo wasn't that bad.  The detection looked far better than the Wii-mote.</p><p>Sony ended with 3 more PS3 games: Gran Turismo 5, God of War 3, and <b>The Last Guardian</b>, which was what I was waiting for.  Previous known as Project Trico, this is the third game in the Team ICO trilogy which includes ICO and Shadow of the Colossus.  They played the trailer that was leaked a couple weeks ago, but had a couple more pieces that were missing before.  It looks fantastic ^_^ and of all 3 press conferences, <b>this is my number 1 game</b>.  I cannot wait for The Last Guardian.  ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of steam from Sony's Conference was taken away by constant leaks leading up to E3.  The Final Fantasy XIV announcement was huge!  But they would've nailed it out of the park if The Last Guardian hadn't leaked, and the PSP Go hadn't leaked.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Nintendo's conference was a little boring, but overall all 3 had some solid games and great announcements. ^_^  All 3 platforms have games I'm interested in for the upcoming year, which makes me excited to be a gamer once again.  Honestly, I thought Christmas 2008 was horrible for games.  Dead Space was the only game that hit it out of the park, and that came out in September.  The disappointments were vast..  Fable 2 sucked, Mirror's Edge sucked, Fallout 3 is boring.  I don't even remember what was released for Wii.</p><p>But for Late 2009, Early 2010, there's tons of crap!  Something for everyone.  Games Games Games!  Even weird ones.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Thoughts on Infamous" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/thoughts-on-infamous">Thoughts on Infamous</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| May 31, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This weekend I played Infamous.  From 4pm yesterday to about 9pm today, with a quick 6 hour nap in the middle.  I think it's somewhat sad that a single near 30 year old decided to spend his free weekend playing a video game almost 23 hours... But shut up.  I haven't had a free weekend in a while, and Infamous is pretty fun.</p><p>Infamous is a new Playstation 3 exclusive game which came out this week.  It's made by Sucker Punch, who are the development team behind the Sly Cooper franchise on PS2.  Last week, they released a demo on PSN and I liked it quite a bit.  So I cleared out my Gamefly queue, and got it in the mail rather promptly.</p><p>You play as Cole McGrath, who's been given Super Powers from the epicenter of a massive explosion that has killed 10,000 people in Empire City.  However, the military has labeled you responsible for the explosion and its up to you to find the real culprit.  Throughout your journey you'll restore order to Empire City, which has been taken over by street thugs.  Blah Blah Blah...</p><p>Cole has the power of electricity and can fire lightning bolts, create shockwaves.  He also has super-strength somehow because he can climb up the side of a building then leap all the way back to the ground without being hurt.</p><p>In Empire City, you can go anywhere and do anything, pretty much.  It's a free roaming sandbox sort of game.  Much like <b>Grand Theft Auto</b>, <b>Crackdown</b>, <b>Assassin's Creed</b>, etc...  There are story missions and side missions throughout the map and you can do them whenever you like.  The twist is the added morality gauge!  You decide whether Cole will be a Hero to Empire City, or its next up and coming Villian.</p><p>That's Infamous in a nutshell.  On the surface it seems like just another game, but Sucker Punch has carefully studied what's wrong with this sub-genre.  Infamous does a lot of things right, but still forgets about some fundamental problems..</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Recognized Difficulty.</b></div><p>At the very beginning, after you escape the crater, you get in your first fire fight with the Thugs.  This is your first mission, Spoiler!  You pull out your lightning hand and begin zapping all the bad guys.  When I completed this mission, the game automatically bumped me up to Hard Mode.  "Ok, you're way too good at shooting dudes.  Normal will be way too easy, you deserve Hard."</p><p>And the game was right!  For me, Hard Mode has worked out great.  It's still been pretty easy.  But there's never been a time when I've been so frustrated I couldn't eventually handle it.  Great Feature!</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Hidden crap shows up on the radar.</b></div><p>In any of those games mentioned above, there's a whole lot of stupid crap hidden through out the world.  Grand Theft Auto has 'em.  Assassin's Creed has 'em.  By gull, Infamous has to have 'em.  Infamous has  Dead Drops and Blast Shards scattered throughout Empire City.  They don't show up on the map, but if you click L3 to do your Spidey Sense, if you have one within range of your Rader, they'll appear!  Searching for this stuff has never been easier.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Hidden crap actually means something.</b></div><p>What real incentive is there to locate anything of this hidden stuff, anyways.  They only things collecting all the packages in Grand Theft Auto gave you was an Achievement.  In Infamous, the hidden stuff is actually useful.  Blast Shards are a means of leveling up your electricity gauge.  When you collect a certain amount, your capicity for holding electricty increases.  Dead Drops are encrypted transmissions that will give you further insight into the background of the story.  Collecting them all also gives you Achievements too.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Every side mission helps you.</b></div><p>In most games, side missions are usually just excuses to level your character or provide some aspect of the story that's not important.  The side missions in Infamous do that too, but when you complete one the territory that Thug's control begins to diminish.  More people return to the area and enemies retreat from the area.  When you go back to the area later for a story mission, it's a lot easier because the amount of enemies have lessened.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Magnetic Physics makes platforming easy.</b></div><p>Cole can climb walls, street lamps.. basically anything with a patruding space can be grabbed and climbed.  Which is a lot like Assassin's Creed or Mirror's Edge.  What's the point of running around a city, if you can't run around on rooftops!  The most annoying part of those two games is when you miss the mark just ever so slightly when you feel you totally nailed it.</p><p>Sucker Punch added a little bit of magnets into the physics so when you're climbing or falling, if you're near something that can be grabbed, Cole will naturally move closer to it.  It makes the hit box much larger, and platforming isn't really that annoying.</p><div class='title'><b>Liked!  Being totally good has its subtle benefits.</b></div><p>No, It doesn't change the story at all.  It probably changes the ending, but the overall story is still the same.  What I really really like is when you're morality gauge is complete filled to good, the citizens of Empire City will actually help you fight the Thugs!  They'll start throwing rocks at the bad guys which makes them easier for Cole to kill!  That's awesome!  They'll cheer you on when you kill Thugs.  They'll cheer you on if you help them out.</p><p>Though, I'd wager that if you were totally Evil, the people would probably throw rocks at you.<br/>___</p><p>These are pretty small things, but they make Infamous incredibly solid.  They removed the more annoying aspects of the annoying parts on the game!  Like searching for hidden crap and platforming.  It ends up making the game less annoying and increases the mileage tremendously.</p><p>After 23 hours, I haven't been pissed off at the game once.  If I die or screw up, it's usually my fault and not the games.  That's quite an accomplishment because <b>most games are stupid and annoying and Infamous really isn't.</b> (&lt;---  Box Quote)</p><p>Playing Infamous is definitely where Infamous shines.  If people talk about Infamous, it'll be about some they did in the game.  Not something that the game did for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Hated!</b></div><p>But unfortunately, that's where Infamous' legacy falls apart for me.  There is nothing special about the Sound, the Music, the Story, the Characters...  Playing the game is great, but everything else falls flat and makes it rather unmemorable.</p><p>All I care about is my morality level, how many blast shards I still need to find, and the other side missions I have left.  I don't care about Cole at all.  I don't care about the climax of the game, nor what Villians I've killed.  Boss Fights have been anti-climatic because who cares?  They're just a bigger version of dudes I've fought earlier.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto IV was repetitive and way too long, but I cared about Niko and was sad when <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"><em>bleep</em></span> died.  Niko is a great character, and that's what I remembered most from the game.  The other characters too.  "Cousin!"  There is nothing memorable about Cole or Zeke or any other character in Infamous.</p><p>So, after playing Infamous for 23 hours, <b>I really haven't gotten anything out of the experience at all</b>.  I wonder if its really worth while for me to take another 5 or 6 hours to finish the game.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Games I buy: Tokyo Edition" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-tokyo-edition">Games I buy: Tokyo Edition</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete</b> 1st Edition<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" /></p><p>Though, Advent Children Complete really isn't a game.  The 1st Edition release contained the demo for Final Fantasy XIII on PS3.  I decided to buy it because Square has no plans to release a disc version of the demo in North America.  And the Advent Children Complete film is entirely in english.  Or, at least, subtitled.</p><p>I figured the "1st Edition" might be difficult to come by since it's a first edition.  But, Square saw fit to produce nearly 2 million first editions of this set, so this product was everywhere.  Every store I went to had copies of Advent Children Complete.  Most used stores even had it.  In fact, Yamada Lavi in Shibuya, which is where I bought it, actually had their copies discounted to around $52.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - English of the Dead</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" /></p><p>While browsing game stores in Shinjuku, I came across English of the Dead for the DS at a Softmap.  I was instantly entranced by the sheer concept and the throwback to Typing of the Dead for Dreamcast.  It's basically the same game!  Instead of typing out words to kill zombies, you translate Kanji into English.  What a perfect vehicle to learn more Kanji!  Instant Purchase.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" /></p><p>I found this game at a Trader located in Akihabara for a mere $20!  For those who don't know, the Doki Doki Majo Shinpan is a dating sim sort of game where you must determine whether or not underaged school girls are witches.  In order to make that determination you must touch and grope these girls with the DS Stylus.  Take a look at this video for a demonstration: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw</a></p><p>The first Doki Doki Majo Shinpan was release in 2007 and prompted much internet humor.  In 2008, SNK released this follow-up that was rated even higher on their Adult-content scale.</p><p>Anyways, $20 is pretty cheap for one of the more bizarre Japanese DS releases.</p><p class='img'><b>DS -

| April 20, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>2 weeks ago Nintendo released the third generation of the Nintendo DS entitled the DSi. The DSi doesn't iterate on the visual design of the DS Lite, but makes several hardware changes. The screens are slightly bigger and brighter. The speakers are more clear. The power button has moved. They've also added 2 low quality cameras for some reason.</p><p>But the biggest change is the removal of the Gameboy Slot on the bottom of the unit. It's sad that nearly 20 years after the original release of the Gameboy that that name will no longer carried. But oh well.. It's been a very long time since I've even used that slot for games.</p><p>With removal of the GBA slot comes the addition of an SD card slot. The SD slot is located on the side where the power button used to be. The primary purchase for this is to store downloadable games and applications from the DSi store, which opened on the same day of the DSi launch.</p><div class='title'><b>Is it worth it?</b></div><p>Yes, yes, all these features are all well and good but does this really warrant a purchase? There's a little bit more processor power, and a little bit bigger screens. But essentially the DSi is identical to the DS Lite. There's no killer-app on the DSi store and no plans for DSi specific games. Why waste $170 buying a new DS?</p><p>Well, my reason for wanting a DSi is the same reason a few others are willing to "upgrade": My DS is beat to shit. I own a launch Japanese DS and over these past 3 years my DS has been my most played gaming platform. I've played the thing so much the touch screen can no longer be re-calibrated to precision. Those super-market credit card signature pads have more precision than my DS touch screen. Trauma Center is unplayable!</p><p>In addition, there's been a tiny renaissance of games lately. (ie: Pokemon Platinum, Tokyo Beat Down, Docomo Dake, Retro Game Challenge, Harry Hatsworth.) There's also a few future titles to look forward to. (ie: Edgeworth Perfect Prosecutor and Zelda Train Simulator.) There's also some great games from the past year that I missed. (ie: Zelda Phantom Hourglass, Trauma Center 2, Bangaioh Spirits.)</p><p>I think an upgrade to workable DS hardware isn't such a bad idea.</p><div class='title'><b>Region locking</b></div><p>Up until now, all Nintendo portable hardware was region free. You can play any Japanese games on an American DS and vice versa. But Nintendo had announced that the Nintendo DSi is region locked. What does that actually mean, though?</p><p>Well, for #1: The Japanese DSi will only have access to the Japanese DSi store. Americans can only access the American store. I think that was already obvious given the way the Wii store works. Unlike Xbox or PSN, the region is embedded in the device itself. So the only way to access a store outside of your region is the purchase the device for that region.</p><p>Pros: Access to kooky Japanese games not available in the US. Games like the <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/ktmj/index.html">Katamari Puzzle</a> game, which may or may not actually be fun. The Art Style series which includes <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kadj/index.html">Decode</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kapj/index.html">Pico Pict</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kasj/index.html">Somnium</a>, <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/dsiware/kahj/index.html">Hacolife</a>, and a couple others. These games remind me a lot of Bit Generations. The Dr. Mario games is over there too.</p><p>Cons: I won't have access to the American games. Though, I don't really see this as much of a Con since the games I care about will already be on the Japanese DSi store.</p><p>#2: DSi Region locking could also mean that DSi specific cartridge based games are un-playable on other regioned devices. Though, this hasn't actually been confirmed since Nintendo has not mentioned any plans of making DSi specific games. However, if they did plan to make DSi specific games, and they were region locked than I would not be able to play American games.</p><p>#3: DLC. Let's say cartridges were not region locked and they were some DSi-only cartridge games. Well, if Nintendo introduced DLC for these titles, it wouldn't be able to access the store for my American games. Though, are there any games for Wii that have DLC?</p><div class='title'><b>Do I buy import?</b></div><p>Personally, I'm going to bet on DSi-only carts being region-free, even though I really have no proof to back that up. That's a problem for future-Me anyways, since all current DS software is region free.</p><p>The decision of whether I buy domestic or import comes to down to the DSi store. It's hard to judge the American DSi store after a mere two weeks of operation, but there are definitely some Japanese games that will never be released here.</p><p>So, I think I will buy a Japanese DSi. They are $20 more expensive than the US ones and come in a few colors not available in the US including <a href="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html" title="http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ds/series/index.html">Pink, Navy and Lime</a>.</p><p>In 10 days, I leave for Japan. When I'm over there I'll either chose a Navy or Lime one. Who knows, though. I might change my mind while I'm in Japan. Or I might not be able to find any. $200 can always buy something else.</p><p>That's not the only thing on my shopping list: <a href="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html" title="http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html">http://dyreschlock.livejournal.com/203962.html</a>.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nuka Cola Recipe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nuka-cola-recipe">Nuka Cola Recipe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 18, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>At work, my ears have a lot of free time. My eyes, my hands and my head is pretty engaged with what is going on, but my ears only get to do something when talking with coworkers. So I listen to a lot of music and podcasts. Usually back and forth between the two, rather than a mix. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for music. Sometimes, I'm in the mood for talking and chatter. My job goes back and forth between planning and execution constantly, so it's a great way to keep the boring execution phase of my job lively.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" /></p><p>My favorite podcast shuts down its doors today, and that is the Brodeo aka GFWRadio formerly CGWRadio. The Brodeo starred the editors of Games For Windows Magazine formerly Computer Gaming World, who were Jeff Green, Ryan Scott, Shawn Elliot and Sean Malloy with Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.</p><p>CGWRadio began on February 16th, 2006. The first couple episodes were a little odd, but they eventually figured it out. On August 8th, 2006, they announced that CGW would become GFW and in November launched their first issue.</p><p>GFWRadio combined a unique brand of gaming humor with the trials and annoyances of working in the gaming journalism business and the joy of being in the business.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>After listening to GFWRadio, I never thought I'd have such an insight into the gaming media. This type of perspective is something that I never even thought about 4 years ago being a gamer. 4 years ago, I was still writing about games, but I never had the insight as to what the game's designers were thinking about, what the publishers were doing to promote the game, and what really went into making the game to begin with. I know so much more now-a-days about the pressures these publishing companies put on game reviews and journalists on exactly what they say about a game.</p><p>They also talked a lot about the themes in games and what the game really meant to them and wouldn't pull any punches. They'd give you their complete honesty opinion on what the game did right and what the game did wrong. They'd also completely deconstruct some games talking about character interaction, plot devices and themes.</p><p>Discussions on GFWRadio were a good balance between these industry related topics, and high-brow video game analysis, but weren't afraid to go completely low-brow too and talk about stupid things they do or have done. It's really just a bunch of guys bullshitting about their jobs, lives and games they play.</p><p>That's really where the term <b>Brodeo</b> came from. Jeff Green was browsing around Urban Dictionary and found this definition: <em>A get-together or a party where the attendance is predominantly male.</em> He brought it up on the podcast and the cult following of GFWRadio labeled it as such.</p><p>The real humor of the show came from "Hero's of the Web", Dramatic Readings, Stories of griefing and gaming, and other coined terms, segments and jokes that became running gags.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>April 8th, 2008 marked the beginning of the end as Ziff Davis put a hard start to Games For Windows Magazine. Actually, I suppose, Ziff Davis declaring bankruptcy was really the beginning of the end. But shifting from a print magazine to the online space wasn't really something the GFW editors had been prepared for.</p><p>I wish I would've evangelized this podcast more when it was in its prime, but oh well. Popularity is not the reason it's ending. It's ending because the key voices of the show have now gone on to do bigger and better things.</p><p>In June, Sean Malloy announced that he had gotten a job for Blizzard and left 1up. Last week, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and he left to work on the Sims with Maxis and EA. And this week, Shawn Elliot finishes up the Brodeo and heads off to 2K Boston to work with Ken Levine (creator of Bioshock) on his next project.</p><p>Ryan Scott, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos are still at 1up and have said that they'll continue to podcast in some form or do something, but the actual Brodeo, has ended.</p><p>Times change. Jobs change. People grow up. You complete college, you gotta move on. You get your first job or your break in the Industry. You usually start at the same place many other begin as well. Eventually, you gotta move up in the Industry. So that's basically it.</p><p>A lot of voices have moved on from 1up, but there's plenty of new voices as well. With the Brodeo gone, I think I'll turn my attention to 1up FM, 1up's new podcast.</p><p>My hope is for a GFW Reunion at PAX 2009. ^_^ It was neat meeting Shawn Elliot at PAX, but I really didn't get to say too much to him.</p><div class='title'><b>Errata</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/x6p03.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, You guys should definitely check out all the previous episodes of CGW/GFWRadio, which are hosted at <a href="https://archive.org/details/GFWRadioCollection" title="https://archive.org/details/GFWRadioCollection">archive.org</a>. I'm not really sure which would be the best to begin at.
