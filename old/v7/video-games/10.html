| February 16, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>This past weekend I finished my second playthrough of Mass Effect 2 in anticipation of the upcoming release of Mass Effect 3.  After picking it up after leaving it for a year and half, I'm amazed at how engaging and rich the entire experience still is.  It's a fantastic game, and definitely my favorite new game to come out of this gaming generation.</p><p>My character has remained consistent throughout the events of Mass Effect 1 and 2.  My Shepard, Jane Shepard, has been a Paragon in most cases, and able to talk herself out of any problem.  She's also been incredibly thorough, completing all side missions, and collecting nearly everything spanned across the galaxy.  Well prepared and powerful.</p><div class='title'><b>Wish Fulfillment</b></div><p>Around the release of Mass Effect 2, Anthony Burch (of Destructoid fame, at the time) released two videos talking about decisions and possible decisions you can make in the game depending on how consistent and thorough you play it.  The videos are from <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-the-wrex-paradox-161493.phtml">January 27th, 2010</a>, and <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/rev-rant-paragon-renegade-162407.phtml">February 3rd, 2010</a>.</p><p>I'm not that big a fan of that obnoxious website, but both these rants brought up the idea of Wish Fulfillment in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.  If you want something bad enough, you can have it!  You can have your cake and eat it, too.  If you want this character to live, you can play the game to the point where they will live.  Want all characters to live?  You can do that too!</p><p>There was one point where you had to make a decisions between two team mates, and one or the other was going to die.  It's the only scene between the two games where you can't have your cake and eat it, too.  It wasn't really a tough decision for me, though, because I didn't really like either character.  And so far, the consequence has been nothing but a palette swap.</p><p>But in Mass Effect 2, you can get on everyone's good side, and have everyone be happy with each other, despite the natural conflicts between some of the characters.  As Anthony mentions in the second video, when characters are fighting and it makes you choose, it should actually make you choose one over the other, rather than choosing some dialogue where both are still your friends.</p><div class='title'><b>Consequence</b></div><p>The idea of Wish Fulfillment dances around the fact that actions have consequence, and we aren't seeing any of these consequences.  That's what Mass Effect's continued Save File persistence throughout the series is supposed to represent.  If you make a decision in a prior game, those decisions come back to bite you in the ass.</p><p>Mass Effect 2 didn't penalize you for making decisions in the first game.  The overall story of ME2 didn't change.  The only thing that changed were certain dialogue choices, and some random people from the first game may make an appearance.  Here's the list of all choices in Mass Effect 1 that had bearing in Mass Effect 2: <a href="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer" title="http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Save_File_Transfer">Save FIle Transfer on Mass Effect Wikia</a>.</p><p>Mass Effect 3 needs to have these consequences finally come to life.  They say they're going to, but they actually have to do it.  And not only that, but make some of your "good" paragon decisions thrown back in your face.  The Paragon/Renegade system isn't about Good v. Evil, it's about Nice v. Mean.  So far you could be either, and it didn't matter.  There needs to be a clear distinction that a Paragon choice you made in the past was wrong, rather than (possibly) making all the Renegade choices wrong.</p><p>Entire areas of the game need to be inaccessible depending on the choices you've previously made.  Certain quest lines should only be available based on your decisions.  And even certain allies in the past, should now become enemies because of something you did.  Mass Effect 3 should be a radically different experience for those who have played through the previous games, rather than just a different character saying different things in place of another character.</p><div class='title'><b>Romance</b></div><p>Romance has been a big part of Mass Effect, and Mass Effect 3 is (supposedly) when all your choices come to fruition.  As male or female Shepard you have 2 choices on who you can get involved with in Mass Effect 1.  In Mass Effect 2, you have 3 choices for either gender, and neither of these choices are the same from the first game.  In ME2, you can cheat on your lover from the first game.</p><p>Well, that's what I did on my first playthrough.  As Female Shepard, I definitely went for Liara, the blue female alien, and then I cheated on her.  I think it was more for curiosity sake if anything because a romance between Female Shepard and Garrus was completely ridiculous.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons I wanted (or needed) to play Mass Effect 2 a second time through was because Liara had a prominent role in a DLC mission, and I wanted to make things right.  The Shadow Broker DLC pack allowed our relationship to continue in Mass Effect 2 in a cute scene aboard the Normandy.</p><div class='title'><b>Alternate Lovers</b></div><p>Outside of those 3 romantic choices in Mass Effect 2, there are 3 (or 4) other instances where you can get physical with other characters.  One of these can only happen if you're male Shepard, and it's with Jack during some random conversation.  The other 2 options are with Samara and Kelly Chambers, both of which I did in addition to Liara in my game.  Like all romances, the more you talk with the character, the more you bond, and the eventual romantic options start to crop up.</p><p>With Kelly, keep talking with her after missions, and eventually you will have the option to invite her up to your quarters for dinner.  This is also beneficial because she was automatically feed your fish for you.  After you complete the final mission, and both of you are alive, talk with her again.  She'll send you an email after the conversation about some private time in your quarters.  Go up to your quarters, and invite her up using the comm system on your desk.</p><p>With Samara, if you continue talking with her after missions, the final step is when she starts to ask about how you feel about her.  You can say "just friends" or "something more" or something like that.  Steer the conversation towards trying to seduce her.  She'll ultimately reject you, but leave her quarters.  You'll find her in the crew quarters next door looking out the window at the FTL drive.  If you talk with her, her response is simply, "Please?"</p><p>I guess there's a fourth alternate romance option, and that's with Morinth.  You can talk her into having sex with you, but this kills you instantly because she's an Adart-Yakshi.  This romance cannot persist because it's Game Over.</p><p>Anyway, after continuing my romance with Liara, then going after Samara, and getting physical with Kelly, the photo of Liara is still standing in Shepard's private quarters.  This photo (on your desk) is your romance from the first game, and if this is tipped over, that means you've cheated.  So, despite sort of cheating on Liara this time, the game doesn't think I've cheated.</p><p>Hopefully this will come back at me in the next game, or at least be touched upon.  If anything, I can say that I've done every possible lesbian relationship on a single save.  High Five.</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect 3</b></div><p>Mass Effect 3 is a mere 3 weeks away!  I'm excited.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Legend of Zelda - Skyward Sword" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword">Legend of Zelda - Skyward Sword</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| January 5, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Skyward Sword is an odd game for 2011.  There are so many things about that are stuck in the last generation of gaming, yet others that seem to push the series forward as a whole.</p><div class='title'><b>Exploration</b></div><p>Despite being billed as a 60-80 hour game, it only took me under 40 hours to finish it.  Granted, I still have a bunch of side quests left, but I don't imagine those'll take me longer than an additional 3 or 4 hours.  With that amount of gametime, you'd think the game would be vast, but it really isn't.  Twilight Princess is definitely spans a larger area, but Twilight Princess is no where near as dense. Â Nearly every inch of Skyward Sword has something to do, and every area has multiple puzzles, plenty of enemies, and lots of little things tucked away in corners for you to find.  It may have been a limitation of the platform that there are only so many of these areas, but there's a lot to do in the tiny space available.</p><p>I miss Twilight Princess' vast open spaces, though.  The distance gave your journey a feeling of majesty and scale.  Your journey took you very far away from home, and into all the reaches of the lands of Hyrule.  In Skyward Sword, you live in the sky, and can (basically) fast travel to 3 separate locations on land.  These locations are never connected, and have almost nothing to do with each other.  BUT, there's plenty to do, and redo.  You revisit them quite a bit throughout the story of the game.  In Twilight Princess, you scarcely revisited areas unless you were on later side quests.  (though, I might be remembering that wrong)</p><div class='title'><b>Story and Character</b></div><p>Skyward Sword is somewhat quirky, but is mystical and has a lot of heart.  I think this is the first Legend of Zelda whose entire story starts from the beginning to the end.  In most Zelda games, you start off in some village and venture out into the world where you encounter evil that is already going on, and are caught up in the middle of it.  Skyward Swords also begins in your hometown, but everything is right with the world.  The evil doesn't show up until a few hours into the game.</p><p>Also, unlike previous Legend of Zelda games, Link and Zelda are very close friends, and have been since childhood.  Every other game, Zelda is the princess of Hyrule, and Link is some peasant overcoming all odds to save her.  Skyward Sword establishes their vast friendship, and makes the journey to save her meaningful outside of destiny.  It's Link's love for Zelda that he continues on, and it makes Skyward Sword incredibly <b>cute</b> and touching in story intense scenes.</p><div class='title'><b>Story Significance</b></div><p>2011 was the 25th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda, and was celebrated with plenty of games.  There were 3 Zelda games released in 2011: Ocarina of Time 3D, Four Swords on DSi and 3DS, and Skyward Sword.  Additionally, Nintendo released a 25th Anniversary art book that encompassed the whole series.  And it had a timeline, too!  Which I mentioned previously: <a href="/old/v7/legend-of-zelda-canonical-timeline" title="/legend-of-zelda-canonical-timeline">December 21st, 2011</a>.</p><p class='img'>Here's a better explanation of the timeline:<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Canonically, Skyward Sword is the very first Legend of Zelda story.  It was first officially mentioned in Wind Waker that in each Legend of Zelda game, you're not playing as the same Link and Zelda.  Almost every character is a different person, and these games sometimes take place hundreds of years apart from each other.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: At the very end of Skyward Sword, this struggle between the Hero of light, the Princess, and the King of darkness is set up.  As the God of evil is slain, he decrees that his hatred is eternal and can never be snuffed out.  As time exists, his spirit will hunt down the goddess, and the hero will be reborn.  This conflict is eternal.  He basically spelt out the entire purpose of the Legend of Zelda series as Wind Waker did.</p><div class='title'><b>Nostalgia</b></div><p>The mystical sense of Skyward Sword are all the gods at play.  You are agents of the Goddess, and are literally fighting evil.  It mirrors a lot of the ancient stories that are sometimes told to explain who you are in previous Legend of Zelda titles.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: But the real nostalgia is what you are doing in the second act on the game.  You are tempering and forging the Master Sword.  In Skyward Sword, you are creating the Master Sword.  The same sword used in most later Zelda titles.  It's amazing to think of all the other games I've used this sword, and now I'm creating it!  Though, I feel it would have been more amazing to forge the Triforce, but (apparently) that's something the gods can only make.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: In the end, a section of your town, Skyloft, falls to the surface and forms what it known as the Temple of Time in future games!  Once you vanquish the God of evil, you seal his spirit in the Master Sword and place the sword in the alter of the Temple of Time.  The SAME position where it is later found in Ocarina of Time.  OMG OMG Nostalgia!  I was livid during the ending of Skyward Sword.</p><p>Though, I felt a greater sense of nostalgia when I returned to the Temple of Time in Twilight Princess.  I was actually exploring the same location that existed in Ocarina of Time, and retrieved the Master Sword from the exact spot it was left.  There was an amazing amount of build up, and execution in that dungeon that it was almost overwhelming.</p><p>Skyward Sword has amazing nostalgia but it's really only in the ending.  In Twilight Princess, it allowed me to explore it, and I felt like I was an archeologist.  BUT, these games occupy separate ends of the timeline.  It easy to uncover stuff from the past when playing in the future, rather than playing in the past and creating everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Music</b></div><p>There are some tunes in Skyward Sword that are quite breathtaking, but for the most part the style of music follows the quirky nature of the game.  It's very upbeat, and runs at a perfect pace for the areas you explore in the game.</p><p>BUT, I still like Twilight Princess better.  The Hyrule Field tracks had the perfect ambience and atmosphere that converyed the majesty and queer nature of the game.  Also, the background track for the Sky Temple is the most deformed ambient song I've ever heard in The Legend of Zelda.  It was the first time I had ever stopped playing a Zelda game, and just listened.</p><div class='title'><b>Twilight Princess v. Skyward Sword</b></div><p>Overall, I think Skyward Sword trumps Twilight Princess.  Skyward Sword doesn't waste any space, there's an actual meaningful story in of itself with characters you care about, rather than just THE NEW rendition of Link and Zelda.  Ever more than that, all the characters in the game have character, and play off each other.  The Art direction in Skyward Sword is whimsical, beautiful, and ridiculously colorful.  And most of the music complements it perfectly.  PLUS!  It's actually pretty fun to play on the Wii.  Twilight Princess was unplayed on the Wii, in my opinion.</p><p>I still like Twilight Princess better, though (Gamecube version, obviously).  I haven't played it in 5 years, so I'm probably remembering it better than what it was.  But I loved the idea of a dark, somewhat creepy Legend of Zelda title.  There were gnarly deformed creatures and enemies.  The art direction used a whole lot of light v. dark.</p><p>There are both great games, and I can't wait to see what's next for Zelda on the Wii U.</p><div class='title'><b>1080p Skyward Sword</b></div><p>The Wii U is set to come out this coming Christmas.  It is 1080p, and I HOPE HOPE HOPE that it'll upscale Wii games to that resolution.

I'm not really that big of a graphics whore, but it's definitely noticeable when it feels like you're playing through a stained glass window. Â But anyway, if the Dolphin is any proof, Skyward Sword can easily be upscaled to 1080p and looks fantastic, so hopefully the Wii U will do such things!<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Legend of Zelda canonical timeline" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/legend-of-zelda-canonical-timeline">Legend of Zelda canonical timeline</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Included in the book are 2 pages detailing the timeline of when all 15 games in the series occur in relation to each other.</p><div class='title'><b>Zelda Canon</b></div><p>While some of the Legend of Zelda titles are definitely direct sequels, it was Wind Waker that first outright said that you are not the first Link.  There have been several Links in the past and will be more in the future.  These games do not happen a couple years later, but in some cases happen several HUNDRED years later with a new person.</p><p>With that, it was pretty obvious which games would follow which other games, but there were several ones that felt like they had no place in the timeline at all.  Like Zelda Four Swords?  Or Zelda Oracle of Ages?  Minish Cap?</p><p>For me, I don't really care about the canon of those spinoffs.  The only games that I ever really considered canon were Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess.  Skyward Sword, too, I guess, but I haven't played it yet. (damn Skyrim)</p><div class='title'><b>Official Canon</b></div><p>But apparently ALL the Zelda games are canon, and Nintendo has released the official timeline that binds them all together.</p><p>Kotaku made an image macro illustrating the timeline.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/N6hT7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/N6hT7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/N6hT7.webp"  /></p><p>The idea is that the ending of Ocarina of Time is somewhat ambiguous.</p><p><b>Wind Waker</b> - The Hero succeeds in Ocarina of Time and continues in the future, only to have the world flooded</p><p><b>Majora's Mask</b> - The Hero succeeds and continues life as a child.</p><p><b>A Link to the Past</b> - The Hero fails and redeems himself.</p><p>Eh, I guess it makes enough sense.  Even though, I had the canon backwards, it really doesn't matter what order they're in if the are separated by hundreds of years.  I had this same discussion with one of my friends several weeks ago, and agreed with my timeline canon as, with time, the world would continue to grow larger and larger, not smaller.</p><p>Whatever...  I don't think the Legend of Zelda really needs to make a canon to house all of its games, or else it'll turn into Metal Gear.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Batman Arkham City Thoughts" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/batman-arkham-city-thoughts">Batman Arkham City Thoughts</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm definitely a fan of the first game, Arkham Aslyum.  It was surprising, and fantastic, and felt like it came out of no where.  Again...  expectations.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham Asylum</b></div><p>I'm not sure if anyone was expecting something great when they first tried out Arkham Asylum, but I always kept reality in check.  There had never really been a <i>Good</i> game made from a comic book IP.  At least, not a mainstream game.  These type of games are usually just IP fodder.  Some random company is contracted for a Batman game, or a Superman game, or a Spiderman game.  They shit it out, and make money on the name recognition.  Kids buy these games in droves!</p><p>But Arkham Asylum was totally different.  It was a true to form modern Metroidvania style game.  The world you explored was small, tight, and as you progressed through the game, the new abilities and techniques you acquired help you access areas you hadn't previously had access to.  Though, power ups were unlocked through story progression, instead of exploration.  There were many secrets that required some backtracking and using your new gadgets.</p><p>All the gadgets and weapons made sense for the character of Batman, and in the context of exploring and getting to new areas.  It worked perfectly.</p><p>The story was kinda kooky, but made sense given the ridiculous nature of most comic book stories.  It wasn't necessarily trying to be realistic.  </p><p>The villains and their motivations were what brought everything together.  What happens when you get all of your enemies together in one place?  Some form an alliance, some are enemies to each other, some you stay away from, and some just pop when it's the most convenient for them.  Arkham Asylum was incredibly consistent with how the villains would react to each other, and to Batman as he infiltrated the compound.</p><p>There were plenty of interesting set pieces as well.  Like Scarecrow warping Batman's mind, or Joker capturing Batman is recreating the opening credits, but with the roles reversed.</p><p>My expectations were always reserved though, so whenever something amazing happened, I was surprised and delighted.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham City</b></div><p>I think for Arkham City, I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and then nothing really did.  It really is just more of the same.</p><p>The story is still okay.  The gadgets are pretty much the same.  Combat is more fluid and fun.  There are 400 Riddler trophies now, instead of 100 in the first game.</p><p>The overworld is about 4 times the size of Arkham Asylum, but it feels really small.  You can only enter just a hand full of buildings.  And when you're in the city, you're usually just gliding from one building to the next.  You aren't really doing anything interesting expect looking for Riddler trophies, or hunting down some random thing for a side quest.  This basically makes Arkham City more like a GTA or Infamous, rather than Arkham Asylum which felt more like Metroid or Zelda.</p><p>There are more villains this time, but it follows the same scheme as the first game.  The heavy hitters are vie for territory in the city, and act appropriately to each other.  Sometimes you are randomly ambushed by those villains who prefer to work alone.  And others form alliances, and blackmail each other.  Not every villain is an actual villain though, which was a nice touch.</p><p>Overall, Arkham City is pretty good and it's fun, but...  it's not really doing anything new.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Catherine" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/catherine">Catherine</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| September 12, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>SPOILERS!!</b></div><p>Catherine is about Vincent.  He's been in a long term relationship with Katherine (with a K) for about 3 years (i think?).  And one day, on April 1st, they are talking in a cafe, and Katherine makes a few passive aggressive mentions about their future.  Later on, at the neighborhood bar, Vincent is chatting up his friends, they take off, and he meets "the girl of his dreams," named Catherine (with a C).  She's the sexiest thing he's ever seen.  After a rough nightmare, he wakes up beside her.  They spent the night together, and now he has cheated on Katherine (with a K).</p><p>While the story makes it out to question your ideas of relationships and love, it really boils down to a morality meter.  Do you want to side with Katherine or with Catherine?  Do you want to pursue your long-term relationship and finally "settle" down, or is this random encounter your ticket out of this jail sentence?  The game poses a series of blunt questions, subtle responses to texts, and responses to other people in similar situations.  Each answer moves to the meter back and forth.</p><p>I should probably mention how I played the game.  I'm not currently in any relationship what-so-ever, and don't really care to be.  I've had love in the past, but I'm over it, and don't really care anymore.  My responses to the life questions posed by Catherine (the game) mirrored this in the beginning.  I was neutral.  I floated in the middle.</p><p>Unfortunately, the game threw a cruel twist at me that I decided to believe.  Katherine said she was pregnant.  That's when my alignment changed and I had to start thinking of kids.  While it's pretty awesome that I personally don't have any kids, given the opportunity of being thrust into fatherhood, I would embrace it.  Someday, I do want kids.</p><p>So from that point on my opinion changed, and my responses to the questions started moving more towards the "stick with your wife" angle.  I was still answering everything as honestly as I could.  I wasn't trying to "game" the system towards any specific ending.  I mean, while I don't really want to be in a relationship right now, if I were in a relationship, I would answer something differently.  And that was reflected in the game.</p><p>These questions are meant to guide you through the story to your ultimate ending, but the story is horribly linear.  Vincent doesn't stand up for himself AT ALL.  He continues to let everything spiral out of control around him with the idea that he has no control over the situation.</p><p>Despite my test responses telling Catherine to fuck off, Vincent continues to sleep with her throughout the week.  While actually talking with Catherine, Vincent doesn't say a god damn word.  The entire game is Vincent constantly thinking to himself about what he should do, rather than actually speaking with Catherine or Katherine.</p><p>How the hell is this guy in a long term relationship when they never see each other, or talk about anything?  Even when texting Katherine, your only choices are bullshit passive aggression.  It's either "I'm sorry" or "Don't worry about me."  You can't actually say anything, or talk about anything.  There's no way of coming clean immediately.  And you NEVER see each other either.  How is this a relationship in the first place?!  A relationship is not some one-sided dialogue.</p><p>Things continue to spiral out of control, and Vincent never does anything about them at all.  It's fucking stupid.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Equally stupid is the way you play the game.  The game takes place over 8 or 9 days.  Each night of the week, Vincent has a nightmare.  The large amount of the game is played during the nightmare, and it's an action puzzle game.  You move around blocks on the wall, and climb up to the tippy top.</p><p>In reality, all men unfaithful men are being subjected to these nightmares.  If you do not reach the top in your dreams, you fall.  And when you fall, you die in real life.  Throughout the course of the game, anyone who dies in the dream, shows up on the news the next day as a new victim of the "curse."</p><p>You can prevent some of these deaths from happening, too.  Vincent meets several other people in his nightmare.  Sharing techniques, and talking about the problems they're facing in real life will help them solve them, and they'll survive the nightmares.</p><p>Catherine (the game) plays off the nightmares as a metaphoric representation of the relationship stress Vincent is going through in his real life.  And it works really well in that context, but it's so divorced from the actual plot that I wish I could just skip it all.  Nothing I do during the climbing sequence has any reflection on the story or plot, so it's completely useless.  You could plug any other type of game during these sequences, and it wouldn't change anything.</p><p>When climbing up these walls, all I can think about is wanting to get back to the real world, tell off Catherine, talk with Katherine and fix everything.  I played the game on <b>Easy</b> difficulty so I could fly through these sequences as fast as possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>Catherine has 8 endings overall.  Throughout the game, the morality meter is displayed and can guide you towards a specific goal.  You'll either side with Catherine or with Katherine.  You can side with yourself as well by staying in the middle.</p><p>Throughout the final challenge, you are given a series of questions that no longer test your morality, but your resolve to stand by those choices.  These are presented to you as every other question has throughout the game.  They aren't as blunt as saying, "are you sure?".  They are truly (trying) to test if you are honest about your decision.</p><p>Whether you side with Catherine or Katherine, each side of the morality meter results in 3 separate endings.  If you answer everything correctly you get the True ending.  If you fuck up, you get the "Good" ending.  If you fuck everything up, you get the Bad ending.</p><p>I feel rather good about myself that I passed these questions perfectly and was rewarded with the <b>True Katherine Ending</b>.  Though, this is really only by the director's standards.  Given how much Vincent continued to completely fuck up, and his inability to fix anything on his own, I feel like I won the Special Olympics.  If he talked about his problems, this would have been over long ago.</p><p>The other two endings are from not choosing either girl, which is really how I personally live my life.  Katherine threw that baby shit at me, and it made me think about things differently.  It turns out she lied about it.  She was not pregnant.  It's not clear if she actually made all that up, but she is not with child.  And by the time, she revealed this, my answers were already aligned with her.  It didn't matter if the baby was real, because I was ready now.</p><p>Which is absolute bullshit.  The damn game tricked me into being someone else.  From the start I was planning on ditching both of them, but she made me care.  Ugh...</p><p>The ending I got felt fake.  And after watching all the endings on youtube, the <b>True Freedom</b> ending felt like the best one.  It ends with the following quote, <b>"Why would you live life without doing what you want?  That's just a recipe for misery."</b> That's what I do everyday.  I live life how I want to.  But I don't agree that this means a person has to stay single to do what they want.  You can do what you want in life with someone else as well.</p><p>Here's a list of all the endings, and how to get them: <a href="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings" title="http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings">http://www.ign.com/wikis/catherine/Endings</a></p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Even though I thought a lot about this game was stupid, I think it accomplished its goal quite well.  It made me question my ideas about relationships, and think about things.  In the end, it's a totally different game than anything else out there, and has more much depth than most others too.</p><p><b>I would totally recommend this game.</b> At 15 hours, it's a perfect weekend game.  And I'm really interested to see how my friends would react in these situations, and what their outcome would be (provided they answer everything honestly).<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX Prime 2011" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-prime-2011">PAX Prime 2011</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

After moving into a new apartment, the last few weeks have been busy and just flew by, and I almost forgot about this.</p><p>At the beginning of August, they released the panel schedule, and over the last few weeks, game studios have been issuing press releases on all the games they plan on having in the exhibition hall.  Everything seems to be coming together, and I'm definitely excited.</p><p>Here's some of the panels (and events) that I plan on attending...</p><p><b>1up Presents: Retronauts v. Your Fondest Memories</b> - Friday 3pm @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Although I don't listen to retronauts anymore, their live podcasts are always great.  Jeremy Parish and Chris Kohler have an incredible wealth of gaming knowledge, and they're joined by Jeff Green this year, which should add some extra humor to the mix.</p><p><b>Minecraft Adventure Update Q&A and Demo</b> - Friday 3pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch hosts a Q&A for the upcoming Minecraft 1.8 patch, and plays through a demo.</p><p><b>After Party w/ The Protomen</b> - Friday 8pm @ El Corazon<br/>An intimate after party with one of the best video game music groups!  Openers include Jonny Nero Action Hero, and Klopfenpop.  Hosted by Fangamer.</p><p><b>Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'</b> - Saturday 10:30am @ Kraken Theatre<br/>Though I'm not really fan of Destructoid people, Ashley and Anthony Burch, along with their father, form a hilarious sibling rivalry over specific games.</p><p><b>Irrational Games</b> - Saturday 2pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>It's been over one year that Irrational Games unveiled their upcoming title BioShock Infinite, the pseudo sequel/prequel to their 2007 hit game BioShock.  The panel is lead by Ken Levine as he discusses the development process, what we're seen already of BioShock Infinite, and they'll probably play through the E3 demo on stage.</p><p><b>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</b> - Saturday 3:30pm @ Unicorn Theatre<br/>One of the biggest and most hyped games of this upcoming season is the new Elder Scrolls game, Skyrim.  Bethesda devs take the stage, and most likely will run through the QuakeCon demo on stage.  Super excited for this one.</p><p><b>Square Enix Presents...</b> - Saturday 7pm @ Pegasus Theatre<br/>Squaresoft is heading a panel as well, and they will be unveiling a brand new title.  This title is Airtight Games upcoming FPS from creative director Kim Swift (creator of Portal, and director of the Left 4 Dead games).  While I don't give a shit about Square anymore, I'm quite a fan of Kim Swift.  Can't wait to see what it is.</p><p><b>Minecraft Griefer Party</b> - Sunday 5:30pm @ Minecraft Booth<br/>Notch is tearing down the Minecraft booth and giving away pieces of it as souvenirs.</p><p>Nothing else really caught my eye.  It seemed like there were a lot more interesting panels at PAX East this year (<a href="/old/v7/pax-east-panels-announced" title="/pax-east-panels-announced">reference</a>).  It's also annoying that there isn't a Chiptune showcase.</p><p>But that's fine.  My time at PAX is almost always spent in the exhibition rooms standing in lines waiting for games.  This year there is a huge amount of upcoming games I'm interested in and all of them plan to be at PAX.  These include <b>House of the Dead</b>, <b>Team ICO Collection</b>, <b>Elder Scrolls Skyrim</b>, and <b>Zelda Skyward Sword</b>.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/these-are-the-games-that-will-be-at-pax-prime-2011-209309.phtml">this list</a>, there will also be indie game <b>Fez</b>, upcoming Suda 51 / James Gunn game <b>Lollipop Chainsaw</b>, <b>Batman Arkham City</b>, <b>Mass Effect 3</b>, Grasshopper published titles <b>Sine Mora</b> and <b>Black Knight Sword</b>, and Sony will have <b>Playstation Vita</b> units to demo too.  Mojaang (Minecraft) has a booth too!</p><p>It should be an amazing fun time.</p><p><b>Update</b>: Added stuff about Minecraft from their <a href="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/" title="http://mojang.com/2011/08/25/pax-2011-schedule/">schedule</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Child of Eden" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/child-of-eden">Child of Eden</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 26, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>On a console that sees release after release of first person shooters in a war setting, or in a space setting, Child of Eden finds itself among a very different crowd.  It's about as opposite as you can get from all that.  It is a unique gaming experience that takes you on a journey of sights, sounds, and color.  Brilliant vibrant colors.</p><p>What Tetsuya Mizuguchi began with Rez in 2001/2002, he has continued with Child of Eden.  The visually stimulating and pulsing background bores its creatures.  On screen, you target these creatures and shapes with the crosshairs, lock on to them, and fire your weapons.  You also have smart bombs, that take care of all the enemies on the screen at once.  Child of Eden adds a third weapon: rapid fire.  Only rapid fire can take down incoming enemy fire, and some enemies are only vulnerable to rapid fire.</p><p>Both Rez and Child of Eden seem rather easy on the surface.  Point and Shoot, right?  It goes a little deeper than that.  In Rez, you start building up massive points if fire all your locked-on shots at once.  Child of Eden continues this scoring method, but adds in a little twist.  You need to fire your shots along with the beat in order to build up your multiplyer.  Rez did this automatically for you.  Once I figured this out, Child of Eden became a much more aesthetically pleasing game.  Music games always sound their best when you play them correctly.  :)</p><p>While this game is a beautiful work of art, I never really felt the same excitement and wonder I did when I first played Rez over 9 years ago.  Rez absolutey blew me away on that winter day in January 2002.  Each level had a unique feel.  It's music was raw, dynamic, and told a story of its own.  While Child of Eden's music has a few dynamic sequences, it feel mostly flat and generic.</p><p>Rez used tracks from established artists, and pulled together 6 songs that had variety and cohesion.  The music behind Child of Eden is a much different story, and barely mentioned anywhere.   It's really just an interactive visualization for the Genki Rockets.</p><div class='title'><b>Genki Rockets</b></div><p>The Genki Rockets is a group formed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi starring a fictional lead singer, Lumi, who is a hologram (much like Sharon Apple from Macross Plus).  It's known now that the lead singer is portrayed by Rachel Rhodes, but whatever.  Also in the group is music producer Kenji Tamai.  All other members are secret, apparently.</p><p>The group began in 2006 when Mizuguchi wrote the song "Heavenly Star", made a colorful video, and posted it to youtube.  It went viral, and became a huge success.</p><p>Like all other J-Pop groups who have fictional characters as band members, they have a detailed back story, and this is the same story that sets up Child of Eden.  Lumi is the first human born in space on September 11th, 2019 (NEVER FORGET).  She expresses her thoughts and feelings through songs, and sends them as messages to earth.</p><p>The Genki Rockets have a unique live performance involving the visual component as highly as the audio.  Since Lumi is in space, and has never been to earth, her appearance is projected on stage using hologram-like technology.  The wikipedia articles states the technology is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner">Musion Eyeliner</a>, which is basically just using a large LED screen that gives the appearance of projecting.</p><p>They really don't have that many songs.  "Heavenly Star" premiered in 2006, and was featured in Lumines II.  In 2007, the recorded a couple more singles, and in 2008, they recorded enough to release an album.  They really haven't done a whole lot up until now.  Here's their tracklist for Child of Eden:</p><p>Stage 1 - Matrix - <b>Fly!</b> (2008)<br/>Stage 2 - Evolution - <b>Star Line</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 3 - Beauty - <b>Breeze</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 4 - Passion - <b>Maker</b> (2011)<br/>Stage 5 - Journey - <b>Heavenly Star</b> (2006) &amp; <b>Flow</b> (2011)</p><p>Check out their website: <a href="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/" title="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/">Genki Rockets dot Com</a>.  They have a live streamed concert on Ustream happening on Tuesday!</p><div class='title'><b>Extended Story</b></div><p>Child of Eden expands on Lumi's story.  With her music, mankind is inspired to explore the vast reaches of outer space.  With their exploration, the Internet expands and grows.  The Internet can be accessed anywhere humans have reached.  And the Internet is renamed to Eden.  Eden is the fountain that which all knowledge flows.</p><p>In the 23rd century, humans rebuild Lumi's likeness and personality in Eden.  Project Lumi nears completion, but is compremised by a virus attack.  And this is where you come in.  Protect Lumi, and complete the project.</p><p>Incidentally, the story of Rez picks up after Lumi is completed.  Later on, Lumi becomes the central AI for Eden and controls the flow of information.  However, the information is vast, and the task becomes overwhelming.  Lumi shuts down, and exposes Eden to all manor of virus attacks.  In Rez, you explore from your local areas of Eden to the central mainframes.  You take down rouge programs and viruses, while rebooting Lumi and restoring order.</p><p>It's rather interesting how Child of Eden portrays the future Internet as a lush utopia of wonder and beauty.  While the future beyond that in Rez is dark and crippled.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Child of Eden seems like the ultimate goal of Mizuguchi's plan for the Genki Rockets.  I really wonder at what point did that plan began.  Unfortunately I'm not as familiar as I should be with his works.  I consider myself a fan, but I haven't played anything of his since Rez.</p><p>After leaving Sega in 2003, he formed Q? Entertainment, and they've made Meteos, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and Gunpey.  Lumines is their huge money maker, and it makes heavy use of music.  Is all that music licensed?  or is it all original tracks developed in house?  I should play that game.</p><p>I wonder if the Genki Rockets was just some weekend project.  He got some of his pals together, jammed, and wrote a song.  Then he started working on the video, and then posted it to see what some of his fans thought.  With its huge viral success, he probably just wanted to see how far he could take it.</p><p>Then again, the Genki Rockets had all their fame in 2006 to 2008.  They sat on the back burner for 3 years until now with Child of Eden.  And you barely see the name "Genki Rockets" anywhere.  Mizuguchi is just retconning Rez to be canon with his washed up JPop band.</p><p>I'd be real interested to know the actual story behind all of this.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Super Potato Osaka" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/super-potato-osaka">Super Potato Osaka</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Their devotion to retro titles is difficult to match in Japan, and if you've ever been in one of their locations, it's quick to see why.</p><p>My little brother and I just returned from a two week vacation in Osaka, Japan and had the pleasure is visiting Super Potato located in Den Den Town.  Den Den Town is a special shopping arcade that stretches along the main street in the ward of Nipponbashi.  It focuses purely on electronics, which extend to video games, anime, movies, figures, and almost all other corners of nerd culture.  Some refer to it as the Akihabara of Osaka.</p><p>Super Potato is very easy to find.  In fact, we really just stumbled onto it, rather than having to search for it.  It sits proudly in the middle of Den Den Town on the west side, and has a big 'ol Mario out front.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3553_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3553_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3553_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>On the first floor are all the current and relavant consoles.  Playstation 3, Playstation 2, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, Gameboy Advance, Nintendo Wii, Gamecube, and so forth.  But upstairs is the true treasure.  Upstairs has software from pretty much every other console not represented downstairs.</p><p class='img'>Sega Saturn, PC Engine, Game Guides, Mega Drive 32x...<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3372_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3372_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3372_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3372_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3372_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'>Nintendo 64, Mega Drive, Game Boy, Game Gear, Wonder Swan, Mega Drive CD, Master System, Sega Dreamcast, Neo Geo, Neo Geo CD...<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3393_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3393_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3393_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3393_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3393_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'>Super Famicom...<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3423_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3423_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3423_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3423_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3423_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'>Famicom and Famicon Disc System...<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3466_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3466_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3466_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3466_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3466_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'>and Playstation<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3503_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3503_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3503_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3503_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110606_potato/IMG_3503_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Each of those pictures is a thumbnail to a larger panoramic picture.

| May 20, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Watchin' Faces, Solvin' Cases.</p><p>I got L.A.Noire in the mail last night, and couldn't help myself but play a few hours and introduce myself to Rockstar's newest title.</p><p>I went through all the "tutorial" missions, and completed my first full case. The tutorials were rather linear and localized. Once I got to the first case, the world really opened up, and the GTA nature of Rockstar games came to light. After completing the first case, the next case started immediately, which was somewhat dissapointing. It felt very linear, but maybe later on they'll give you a choice of different cases to follow and accomplish.</p><p>When solving a case, you most collect evidence from the crime scene, interview witnesses, and follow the clues. The clues will bring you to different locations in 1947 Los Angeles, and the case continues to unfold. The first case ended rather predictably, and there really wasn't much variation. Though, I'm sure that later cases will have multiple valid endings.</p><p>It's actually pretty fun. It's very much in the same vain of your Ace Attorney titles, except completely presented as an open world Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>I was somewhat bored with it last night, but the more and more I think about it this morning, the more and more I want to return to the world of Cole Phelps.<br/>____</p><p>It's pretty similar to Heavy Rain. You definitely do a lot of the same things in the same manor, such as interrogation and crime scene searching, but it doesn't feel the same. I'm not really sure why...</p><p>Crime scene searching is nearly identical. As you walk around, the controller will vibrate if there's a clue nearby. Your character picks it up, and can twist and twirl it around to look for specifics. If it's relevant, you make a note of it in your crime log. These clues can be used as evidence later on when interrogating people.</p><p>Interrogations involve a list of questions in your crime book. You ask a question, and the person gives a response. You have 3 options. You either believe them (truth), or doubt them, or call them a liar. I'm having trouble telling the difference between Doubt and Lie. But from what I can tell, you can call them a liar if you have definitive evidence their statement is false. You can doubt them if you think their statement is false, but have no real evidence to back it up.</p><p>What's hilarious is as your detective level goes up, you can use a "life-line" to help you choose truth/doubt/lie. Using a point will take a way an answer. You can also "phone a friend" by using points to see what the Rockstar Social Club recommends. :)</p><p>I guess it reminds me more of Phoenix Wright, rather than Heavy Rain because Heavy Rain felt more fluid and natural. Phoenix Wright and L.A.Noire have a very apparent game-y layer for the investigation and interrogation that does not suspend my disbelief. But you still do the same type of things in all 3 games.<br/>____</p><p>It's hard to not say this is some kind of a GTA clone, since it is open world and made by Rockstar.</p><p>While GTA is totally open world, and you can pretty much do anything at any time, L.A.Noire feels more restrictive. Between Case 1 and Case 2, there was no leisure time, or even an option to choose Case 2. In that manor, it feels less open, and far more mission oriented. I feel like I'm wasting time, when I'm driving off to stop a random street crime, search for hidden cars, or find historical landmarks. Also, since you're playing a cop, you don't really have much the full spectrum of morality choice. It's kinda like Mass Effect in that way, where you're either play Captain Picard or Dirty Hairy. You're still on the good side of the law. And you can't change that.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/11">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/9">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (40)
