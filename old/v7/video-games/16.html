I wrote a little bit about this before (<a href="/old/v7/free-running-game" title="/free-running-game">here</a>), but it's a free-running game where you leap and bound twixed rooftops and inside buildings.  They had the exact same demo I've seen about a thousand times, but I decided to stand in line and actually feel the controls for myself.</p><p>And it played exactly like you think it would.  Running around is pretty intuitive and fun.  It's not as easy as it looks, but it's not really difficult.  The challenge of the game will be figuring out where to go.  Once you've got that down, each level will have a time trial and leaderboards.</p><p>Playing Mirror's Edge was exactly how I expected it to be, but I'm still skeptical on the length of the game.  We asked the demoer a few times about the length of the game, and he could not comment.  Which means its probably not more than 10 hours long.  There's plenty of replay in the time trials though.  But still, Portal had a bunch of replay, but was still only a 3 hour game.</p><p>I think this game will lend itself well to a rental.  But since I've already preordered it, and it IS fun...  I think my $60 will be well spent.<br/>___</p><p>It should be noted that Mirror's Edge comes out November 11th for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC platform.  Though, Dice has announced that Playstation 3 is the lead platform, and the two Demo units at PAX were both Playstation 3.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX: Dead Space Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-dead-space-hands-on">PAX: Dead Space Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Dead Space is a bit of an anomaly as I really can't explain why I'm so excited.</p><p>The story is pretty standard.  The crew aboard the mining ship US Ishimura has been invaded by monsters or something.  The monsters have eaten and mutilated the crew into monsters themselves.  You play Isaac Clarke, who has not been affected yet, but survive by killing these monsters and your infected friends and loved ones.</p><p>The setting is pretty standard.  You walk around this ship finding your crew mates, or a way off the ship or something.  But come across these zombies.  It reminds me a lot of Doom.</p><p>One of the things that does stand out is the complete removal of any HUD.  You don't have a little mini-map.  You don't have an ammo counter.  All the information is in the environment as if Isaac is actually looking at it.  So the Ammo counter will be ON the gun.  Your health is stripped down your spine.  Redwood Shores completely immerses you in the game, and I think they succeed at that.</p><p>The demo had some interesting little areas too.  When running around in the demo, your main task is to restore gravity to your sector of the ship.  You have magnetic boots, so it doesn't look like you're in Zero-G.  But you can hop off the ground at any point and walk along the wall, or the ceiling.  The game will orient itself to you, so now the wall or ceiling is the floor.</p><p>I think my Fable II money is better spent on this fine product.<br/>___</p><p>It should be noted that Dead Space comes out around Halloween this year for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC.  Though, the two demo units at PAX were Xbox 360.  I asked the executive producer, who was at the booth, if they had a lead platform, and he assured me that it was developed for a multiplatform focus, and that all versions are identical.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to PAX: Fable II Hands On" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pax-fable-ii-hands-on">PAX: Fable II Hands On</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Fable II is an action rpg that's meant to be massive, yet have a wide variety of environments and such.</p><p>The first one really wasn't all that great.  But my roommates were hooked on how ugly all the characters were, and their god awful english accents.  We had hours of fun in the game doing stupid things to make our characters as ugly as possible.  And later on we'd recite quotes from the game in accent.  Well, honestly, it was I that was really doing all those things around the house.</p><p>When I think about how stupid the game actually is, I don't know why I'm so SHOCKED that the game blows ass.  The game looked awful.  It looked Too Human shit itself.  Ugly low resolution graphics with horribly modeled characters running around with beat sticks chopping up even uglier crap.  It felt like I was playing Nightmare Creatures on the Dreamcast.  2 minutes into the demo, I was embarassed to be seen even near the kiosk.</p><p>The whole breadcrumbs linearity is completely pandering when the environment was just as Linear as the first game.  What happened to an expansive world to immerse yourself in?  It still reminds me of Crash Bandicoot, except a sticky gross mess.</p><p>What a piece of shit.  There's no way I'm paying any amount of money for this garbage.  I'm getting a refund on my preorder.<br/>___</p><p>It should be noted that Fable II is an Xbox 360 exclusive title with a mid-October release date.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Penny Arcade Expo Impressions" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/penny-arcade-expo-impressions">Penny Arcade Expo Impressions</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Last year, it really didn't feel all that crowded.  Sure there were tons of people, whose totals overcame 40,000, but I could still play stuff without waiting too long, and get into panels and main events I wanted to.</p><p>This year is huge.  After roaming around the exhibition hall, and going to some panels and movies, everything had some sort of line and a crowd.  We were unable to see Ken Levine's keynote and the inaugural Penny Arcade Q&A session of Friday because the room had been completed filled.  I don't think there were that many people last year that they refused entry.  Yet this year, the main event was moved in a larger room and was completely filled?  I'm sort of cringing at the amount of crowds we'll see today.

I've found Waldo at a couple of places now.  Once at the Quest in Minneapolis, once at the <a href="/old/v7/barack-obama-in-madison" title="/barack-obama-in-madison">Obama Rally in Madison</a>, and now at PAX.  Waldo is getting easier to find.</p><div class='title'><b>Finishing off the night</b></div><p>After 1up Yours, Five, Jess and I caught up with Ace who had just finished his day of work and went to dinner.  We walked a few blocks to the nearby city mall, which had a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1927.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1927.webp">Daiso</a>!  Saw the movie, Second Skin in a video room.  And saw Jonathan Coulton, signing to a massive crowd in the dark.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" /></p><p>Jess worked one of the video rooms until the 3am closing time, so Five, Ace and I walked down to the Console Freeplay area and checked out a copy of Soul Caliber IV to keep us busy.  All the events and things during the day were pretty spectacular, but it's really the low key nature of just bull shitting around in a fighting game that really put a satisfying cap on the day.  It's was the same with playing DDR earlier, too.</p><p>I've really missed that social aspect of gaming since moving to Madison.  Most of the games I play have really all been single player experiences.  I'll get into games like Burnout Paradise for the online play, but I'm never playing with friends.  All the social aspects of a single player experience come from the aftermath for me.  After you've completed the game, and talk about it with people.</p><p>It was really great returning to that college atmosphere in the wee hours of the morning.  And Soul Caliber was the perfect vehicle.  I <a href="/old/v7/back-to-the-stage-of-history" title="/back-to-the-stage-of-history">wrote</a> about it a couple weeks, how Soul Caliber is really a window in the past for me with social gaming.  From playing with friends at Toys R Us, and getting to know people in college. It was the drug of choice, and playing it last night brought back all the fun warm fuzzy feelings.  ^_^</p><p>Also, Soul Caliber IV is fantastic and beautiful and I'm totally picking up a copy when I get back to Madison.  Even though I don't really have many people to play with, yet.  I think I'll introduce it some places and see how it goes.  Also, If those who do have the game play enough on their own, whenever we do get back together, we'll be on equal grounds.  (I'm looking at you Erika)<br/>___</p><p>So that's my Friday at PAX.  For the most part, I know what to expect today, so I won't be too disappointed if there's just too many people preventing me from seeing what I want.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Lost Via Domus" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/lost-via-domus">Lost Via Domus</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The world is split up into 6 worlds in which you use Time as the main catalyst to advance and collect puzzle pieces.  The basic premise of the story is fairly standard at first.  Tim is looking for the princess, and with the completion of each world, is told the princess is in another castle.</p><p>On the surface that is all this game is.  Hopping, Skipping and Jumping.  Standard gameplay mechanics until you begin realizing your actions as the player.  You're killing endless amounts of these golems to achieve success.  To regain a puzzle piece piecing together a lost memory.  Once you've collected the pieces and assembled the puzzle, the memory is complete.  Yes, you have been here and these were your actions.</p><p>The next puzzle complete and the next puzzle complete.  You descend into madness searching for your lost princess.  Where is she?!  You are obsessed.  No one will stand in my way.  She is my princess and how dare you hide her from me.  Your senseless evil monsters will not win.  You can't win.  I am the true hero.</p><p>Thus it continues.  The senseless murder continues until it is complete.  You cannot find her in the present.  Your future is void without her.  The past is the key.  You've been using Time all along to find her.  It's time to go back to where it began.  That single night.</p><p>Backwards on that day with death following you.  When we worked together with the one goal of being reunited.  It was then when I finally reached your window and peered at you asleep that you screamed and ran.  I tried to catch up..  I tried to catch you.  And you tried to kill me.  You ran away.  But I will find you.  Nothing will come in my way.</p><p>There had to be something missing in all my memories.  Very hidden hints of something larger.  Those pesky stars in which I cheated to find.  With nearly all of them, I cannot only relive the event of that day, but change it slightly to obtain her.  And that is what I did.  And now all that is around me is on fire.  A smile crept onto my face.  But I had to ask myself, 'Is this what I thought happiness would be'?</p><p>____</p><p>Tim is a psycho.  The world that you control his actions appears like a cutesy little video game in Tim's eyes.  But what are his actions in real life.  How many doors have you broken into?  How many grizzly townfolk have you trampled?  How many kingdoms have you crumbled?  Does the princess even exist?<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Back to the Stage of History" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/back-to-the-stage-of-history">Back to the Stage of History</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| July 27, 2008 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Over the weekend, I bought something rather frivolous.  When shopping around at various used stores in Green Bay, the pre-played in Appleton had a copy of Metal Gear Solid 4 Limited Edition for $60.  So, even though I already own the game, I bought this edition for the extra things that come with the Limited Edition, which is just a Blu-ray of 'making of' featurettes and a Soundtrack.  It also comes in a spiffy case.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080725_greenbay/IMG_1734.webp" /></p><p>Sometimes my collector's nature overcomes me, so today I started watching the Blu-ray to sort of put worth to my purchase and I watched the first featurette called Hideo Kojima's Genes.</p><p>This focused very much of Kojima; his thoughts, feelings and goals for Metal Gear Solid 4.  And also the final 4 grueling months of work before the games release.  Blah blah blah... he has a vision for the future of the series, and he wants new developers to take the helm and continue with new characters and stories in the universe that Solid Sanke started.</p><div class='title'><b>Bugs</b></div><p>What interested me were how they handled the bugs.  Their bug tracking system works a lot like the process we used at Distance Education at UWP rather than what we do at Widen.  At Widen, we use an incredibly fast piece of software called Fog Bugz.  Each bug, feature, and enhancement has a specific case number and it gets assigned back and forth to different people.  When the case is complete, it's set to resolved and then passed to QA who either re-open it and assign it back to someone to fix again, or it's closed.  Cases can be assigned to user created categories and time tables.  It's really helpful. ^_^</p><p>The process we used at Distance Ed is far more archaic, but it's pretty much the same thing except printed out.  Someone would print out some pages from our website and draw on the changes they wanted.  Whether it be layout changes, text changes, or anything really.  This worked well for them because of the physical nature.  If you didn't know how to completely explain what you wanted, you just drew it out.  Then they'd have a cover letter for each bundle of papers paper-clipped to the top with who the change was from, who fixed them, and who verified their fix.</p><p>My inbox would be full of black and white printouts with red ink all over them.  I'd take them to my desk, make all the changes, then sign off the changes.  I'd go back to the office area after finishing all the stuff and distribute them to people to verify them.</p><p>From the looks of things Kojima Productions does something quite similar.  They have a sheet of paper that represents a single bug.  On the top are several squares for people's names throughout the flow of the bug resolution.  The person who found it, the person who fixed it, the person who verified the fix, and the person who found it will write off it's resolution.</p><p>The rest of the paper is where the bug details are written, but there's plenty of room to draw out the scenario too.  Several of the bugs I saw had a quick sketch of a map to show where the bug was found.  Another other has sketches of guards that were holding guns a little awkward.  They weren't incredibly detailed, but each bug made their point pretty well.  There were still instances where the programmer had to talk with the case opener to understand exactly what the bug was. ^_^</p><p>I find it interesting that in these 3 examples, where the overall products are completely different, the whole bug finding and fixing processes are essentially identical.  They're just slightly tweaked in each case to fit the needs of the crew.  In the case of my current job, Widen, paper would be an absolute mess.  I'm really glad I'm no longer in an environment where the printer is constantly running.</p><div class='title'><b>Product</b></div><p>In the featurette, there were several points where the programmers were super-pissed off at Kojima's persistent revisions.  It's really amazing that they made the June release date when they re-did parts of the dialog at the end of February!  Add smoke here, adjust the difficulty there.  They showed plenty of clips where they'd just be walking along or watching a cutscene and the debug screen would POP up with a status report saying something was wrong.</p><p>But through the month of March, they starting getting the outstanding bugs under control and began smiling about their product.  I've gotten to this point several times.  Kojima described it as a "Developer's High"  It's around the point where you see the end of the tunnel, but more importantly when you see the full extent of the fruits of your labor.</p><p>Much like when you're climbing a mountain.  You're always looking up, looking forward to your destination.  You'll hit a couple way points on the way.  A chance to look down and see how far you've come.  You look back at your success that has brought you to this point and even though you still have a ways to go, you impress yourself.  You feel accomplished and you have something to show for it. ^_^</p><p>At Widen, I've been working on two areas of our development that are pretty much my own, programming-wise anyways.  Certainly anyone can work on them, but our team is small enough that the amount of tasks fall into more categories than developers.  So, for the past two or three releases these areas are mine.  It's interesting to reinstall a version of the software before I started messing with it and see how far it has come since then.  What once were simple pages are now full of technology in the background to streamline the process.  Basically automated robots doing manual work.</p><p>Each release has had an impact on how they work and I'd be interested to see just how far reaching these changes make it.  Unfortunately, the nature of our product pretty much prevents me from finding out.  Oh sure, we'll get managorial feedback that this is helping and I'll see an email here and there.  But I don't get to see the smile of a satisfied user.  I'm not really sure if there would be one either, since what I'm making is a software solution for someone's job.  My work basically facilitates the work of someone else facilitating the work of someone else.</p><p>The developer's high in this case comes to the amount of work put into these "robots".  I've built a pretty slick assembly line with all the little rules and exceptions to those rules and exceptions to the exceptions to the rules that the client has laid out.  It's neat having all these complicating guidelines, translating that into code, and that watching the works move along with only the occasional hiccup.</p><p>The developer's high at Kojima Productions for Metal Gear Solid 4 is a little different.  They understand their product more because it's intended as entertainment and directly for the public.  I understand what I do in the context and the language of the terms given to me.  I do understand how and why it's used, but I don't have the experience of using it.  I can only imagine what might be more useful.  Well, fast, reliable, working software is always useful ^_^</p><p>Anywho, I'm not really sure where I was going with this but it's pretty neat to see that mountain from the top looking down.  Also, writing all this was another way to justify my frivolous purchase.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/17">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/video-games/15">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (30)
