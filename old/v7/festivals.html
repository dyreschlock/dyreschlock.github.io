| July 12, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>While Saturday was pretty fun, I was really looking forward to today, Sunday.  Today we have Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, Eric Prydz, and Sasha.  Guy Gerber has been solidifying his name among the best in the business over the last couple of years.  Eric Prydz has been HUGE in all the circles of electronic music.  And Sasha is a living legend.  Sasha's involvement guaranteed my sale from the first day tickets went on sale.</p><p>Five and I woke up from our long day of music, and finally left the house around Noon Thirty, I think.  The skies were pretty clear, but there were some bizarre storm warnings that came across the morning news and the weather reports.  One report announced a Severe Thunderstorm warning from 12:45 to 1:30, which we thought was odd.  The radar had absolutely no storm activity in the Chicago area.</p><p>We were directly West of downtown a couple of miles, so our plan was to drive down Lake St., then north up Michigan Ave, to Lake Shore Dr., and then get to the beach.  During the 20 minutes it took us to drive 4 miles to Michigan Ave, the sky turned completely dark.  Huge black clouds surrounding down Chicago.  And winds blew around all kinds of trash and debris.  People walking around on the streets quickly went inside of building to shield themselves for the horror that was about to dump in the downtown area.</p><p>Five and I turned onto Michigan Ave, and got onto Lake Shore Dr. pretty quickly.  Over Lake Michigan there were clear blue skies, but looking West was the direct opposite.  Five continued to drive north, and the clouds emptied on to the city.  We seemed to escape it, though, as only a couple of drops hit our car.  We passed a couple of downed trees by the beach, where everyone was evacuating.</p><p>We reached Montrose beach, which is about 6 miles north of downtown.  All of the storm clouds really stayed directly over Chicago.  There were gray clouds above where we were, but the really dark horrific ones were south.  It was very bizarre.</p><p>Rather than head out to the beach in the middle of a storm, Five and I walked to a nearby restaurant to meet up with our pal, Brian, to wait out the storm.  40 minutes later, we exited the restaurant.  The skies were a little gray, but the storm definitely passed.  By the time, we actually got to the opening gate for Wavefront, you couldn't even tell that a storm was there.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2656.webp"  /></p><p>Well, except for the line of people waiting to get in.  Wavefront shut down, and evacuated everyone for 2 hours for fear of storm damage.  A fire department helicopter was circling the beach, and accessing the current weather before Wavefront could proceed with its event.  We were in line only a little while before the Fire department gave the go ahead, and people were admitted entrance.</p><p>Five, Brian, and I made it in around the same time we got in on Saturday, about 3pm.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2669_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2667.webp"  /></p><p>I went straight over to the North Stage to see who was on deck.  <b>Danny Daze</b> was spinning a fantastic groovy House set to welcome the crowd back into the festival.</p><p>By the way, along the sides of each stage were a bunch of VIP cabanas.  The North Stage had 3 big ones, and 4 smaller ones.  Each of those Large cabanas cost $10000 to rent for the weekend.  They included plenty of accommodations on top of the prime real estate, but yikes...  I think I'd rather buy a car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2689.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2702.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2705_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>We wandered around a little bit though, and found ourselves over at the South Stage, where <b>Betatraxx</b> was spinning a rather hilarious set.</p><p>The tracks he played was a perfect example of why a lot of people don't take dubstep seriously.  He played a dubstep remix of the <b>Requiem for a Dream</b> epic ending song.  He followed it up with a dubstep remix of the <b>Epic Fight Music</b>.  And then went into a dubstep remix of <b>NES Punch Out</b>.  After which he threw in some classical music, and other dubstep remixes of random well known songs.  It's a prime example of pandering to the crowd for cheap cheers rather than actually building an incredible vibe that stands on its own.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2717_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2757_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2732.webp"  /></p><p>We were really just waiting around for <b>Nadia Ali</b> and <b>Chris Lake</b> to show up.  Nadia was supposed to start at 4pm, but the time came and went without her on stage.  Then 4:30pm rolled around, and Chris Lake didn't show up either.  I guess they were delayed because of the freak weather earlier.</p><p>A local DJ took the stage not too long after 4:30.  He was only up there for 20 minutes or so before Chris Lake arrived and took over the controls.</p><p>The crowd was certainly into it, but my attention headed back to the North Stage.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2803_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2781_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2769.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2794.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2894.webp"  /></p><p>At 5pm, <b>Benoit &amp; Sergio</b> started to perform their set on the North Stage, and that's basically where I stayed for the rest of the day.  They played a fantastic set that was both mellow and energetic and played perfectly off the crowd.  Their set rolled perfectly into <b>Guy Gerber</b> who continued with the beautiful vibe.  He didn't tear down the vibe, or try to change it.  He built on the sound Benoit &amp; Sergio started and subtly crept in his own sound.  Seamless.</p><p>And what Guy Gerber started, <b>Steve Lawler</b> built upon.  He absolutely set me on fire.  I don't know why I had a negative opinion of him before, but his set was the perfect build up.  Everything started with Benoit &amp; Sergio into Guy Gerber into Steve Lawler, and just kept building and building, hour after hour.  I was so lost in the atmosphere that I could not care one bit that <b>Eric Prydz</b> was on the South Stage.  I could not pull myself away from Steve Lawler.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2812_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2895_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2958_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2993.webp"  /></p><p>And as the clock hit 8:30pm, the stage rotated around for <b>Sasha</b>, and much like the DJs before him, he continued to build.  He piled on that raw classic sound with the fresh chill sounds of summer.</p><p>I think trying to describe the sound of his set is a bit futile.  I mentioned in a <a href="/old/v7/sasha-spybar-chicago" title="/sasha-spybar-chicago">previous post</a> that aside from his darker raw progressive house sound, he has a more Tech House / Indie House kind of sound that he's been spinning at his 'Never say Never' events at Ushuaia Beach Resort in Ibiza.  But at this point his Tech House / Indie House vibe has completely taken over, but with his signature style underneath.</p><p>Over the last year, he's been in the studio producing some of his own music.  He's released a few tracks on his Last Night of Earth record label, as well as working on the third installment of his Involver CD series, which he's been somewhat secretive about.</p><p>He started 'Never say Never' because he felt he wasn't playing tracks from all the artists he loved, and, now, 3 years later, he's made that sound his own.  He's separated himself from the other Progressive House kings, and puts himself alongside Guy Gerber, Benoit &amp; Sergio, and all the other DJs that spin a more Tech House vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3050_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3059_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3104.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_3163.webp"  /></p><p>His set from Wavefront was the perfect soundtrack to a warm summer day.

After going to North Coast and Spring Awakening, it was amazing going to a festival where I was completely in tune with the music.  I liked plenty of artists from North Coast and Spring Awakening, but both festivals have all the acts I care about in a Swiss cheese pattern.  Both festivals are geared towards the new generation of electronica fans, and the music I care about gets shoved in whatever time slots remain.</p><p>I really hope SpyBar achieved the success they hoped for with Wavefront, and I hope they make this a yearly event.

| July 4, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>The summer of music festivals continued this last weekend with the Wavefront Music Festival.  Wavefront was hosted by Spy Bar on Chicago's Montrose Beach, slightly north of the downtown area.  The purpose of Wavefront was to bring together the old crowd of electronic music lovers, with the new crowd.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120701_wavefront/IMG_2691.webp"  /></p><p>For the past couple of years, React has grown and grown and become the leader in electronic entertainment in Chicago, and the type of talent they've brought to Chicago has been mostly mainstream.</p><p>I complained about this a little bit in the <a href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field" title="/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">Spring Awakening</a> post, but as dubstep, electro house, and other certain genres have become quite mainstream, the other genres are starting to become second class citizens.  At first, there was room for everyone, and all of electronic dance music seemed to flourish, but these days it seems like those genres are getting choked out by the popular crap.</p><p>I think the fans of true dance music are starting to notice, and fight back a little bit.  There was an article a couple weeks ago, railing on the popular DJs today, enforcing that they don't even play DJ sets.  They basically just play rock concerts.  They play the same set from front to back without little variation at all.  They don't play to the crowd.</p><p>And that's exactly what the kids these days want.  They go to these major events to hear their favorite tunes, rather than hear something new or reactive to the vibe.  That's why so many of these DJs are playing the same songs from the last 3 or 4 years, and why they play so many pandering dubstep remixes.  The crowds at these concerts <b>only seem to care about the content of the song</b>, rather than the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2044_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Wavefront had two stages, the North stage and the South stage.  The South stage had plenty of electro house, dubstep, and other popular crap.  They had such acts as Bad Boy Bill, MSTRKRFT, Erick Morillo, Chris Lake, John Dahlback, Eric Prydz, and Duck Sauce.</p><p>The North Stage had me sold on Day 1, though.  They had Visionquest, Art Department, Matthew Dear, Benoit &amp; Sergio, Guy Gerber, Steve Lawler, and <b>Sasha</b>.  All groovy mellow house, whether it be Progressive House, Deep House, or Tech House.</p><div class='title'><b>Day 1 - Saturday</b></div><p>Five and I both purchased weekend passes for this event, and went down to Chicago on Saturday afternoon.  We got to the beach around 3 o'clock, right in the middle of <b>Visionquest's</b> set.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_1987_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2016_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2108.webp"  /></p><p>Visionquest played a very nice mellow opener set for the day.  It wasn't outrageous or over top.  It was the perfect start for the day.  And the perfect set up for <b>Art Department</b>.</p><p>Art Department played an amazing bass heavy deep house set.  I recognized a couple of tunes from some of their previous sets, and ones from Sasha, too.  This was how I knew I was home at this festival.  The crowd responded and grooved along with the set, and Art Department kept pumping in the vibe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2158.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2159_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The sound from the North Stage was incredible.  In that above photo, you can see piles of subwoofers in front of the stage.  You could move almost anywhere on the beach, and still hear the music with perfect clarity.</p><p>And most of the crowd was pretty well spread out too, so you could move around without bumping into people.  There were people in the back, laying on their towels, catching some sun.  Other people sitting in some plastic chairs, relaxing to the wonderful music.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2124_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2197_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>As Art Department finished up their kickin' groovy set, <b>Matthew Dear</b> hopped up on the stage and starting setting up for his act.

He brought the vibe down a little bit from the heights Art Department brought it to, but Matthew kept it going.</p><p>Five and I started wandering around a little bit to see what else was going on.  We walked over to the local stage and listened to <b>Gene Farris</b> for a little while.  And he was playing a pretty energetic Housey set.

It seems like whatever substance he may have had back in the day is long gone now.</p><p>Five and I continued to walk around the festival grounds.  We went away from the beach, and took a look around the food stands for something to eat.

These guys are one of the few electro groups that I haven't written off yet.  Underneath their occasional obnoxious sounds, they still carry a beat.  It's still Dance music.  Most popular tracks these days, and Dubstep especially really isn't dance music as much as it is "rock-out" music.  You can't dance to it.  You throw your fists and arms in the air, and rock out, or rage out to it.</p><p>Unfortunately, MSTRKRFT's set didn't really evolve over time.  When they transitioned from track to track, it felt more like they were simply changing it up, rather than building on whatever vibe they had set.  So, after awhile, it really didn't carry as much weight.  It went back to the mentality of having a set list, rather than a vibe.

So, Five and I took off for the day.  We drove north a little bit and went to a small pizza place with a whole lot of comfortable seating.  It was a pretty fine day, and we still had the rest of the night to look forward to.</p><p>Wavefront had plenty of after parties to choose from, but the one I was most interested in was the one at Smart Bar.</p><div class='title'><b>Visionquest + Art Department @ Smart Bar</b></div><p>Art Department blew me away earlier in the day, and I definitely wanted to hear more of them.  Five and I arrived at the club around 11pm, and it was already pretty packed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2612.webp"  /></p><p>In the booth, the members of Visionquest were taking turns spinning their house beats.  It was a mix of Deep House, and regular 'ol House.  And much like their set during the Wavefront Festival, they kept a lid on the vibe.  They never went over the top, or blew me away, but kept that perfect tempo that continued to tease me.  It really felt like they were holding back, but that was par for the course as they were opening up the night for Art Department later on.</p><p>Visionquest is a 4 man group, and it seemed like each member was given an hour (or so) to spin the set they wanted.  When we arrived <b>Ryan Crosson</b> was on the decks.  Around 12:30 or 1 o'clock, <b>Lee Curtiss</b> took over the controls for the better part of the evening.  Lee played a fantastic set, but again, it still felt like an opening set.</p><p>As 2am rolled around, I was starting to feel the wear of the night.  Lee's set wasn't energizing me enough to keep moving, and I was really only waiting for Art Department to take over and blow me away.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2605.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2605.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2605.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2616.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2631.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2631.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120630_wavefront/IMG_2631.webp"  /></p><p>Around 2:30, <b>Shaun Reeves</b> set up and began spinning some of his tracks, and that was pretty much it for me.  When was Art Department planning on showing up?  It's approaching 3am, and they still aren't here?  Were they only going to spin for an hour?</p><p>Bleh, I was falling asleep, and needed to find a bed.  It was a long day.  So we left, and ended our first day of Wavefront.</p><p><b>Overall</b>, Art Department was pretty damn fine.  Matthew Dear and Visionquest weren't half bad either.  But a lot of the other scheduled talent fell pretty flat for me.  I wonder if Art Department ever showed up to Smart Bar that night.</p><p>The real fun was on Sunday, anyway :D</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to The Spring Awakening @ Soldier Field, Chicago" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">The Spring Awakening @ Soldier Field, Chicago</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 21, 2012 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend was The Spring Awakening held in Chicago.  It used to be a single night event with two or three major headliners, but with the massive popularity of electronic dance music continuing to surge, and React, the promotion company, continuing to pull off massive successful events, The Spring Awakening has expanded to an entire two day music festival.  It took place at Soldier Field in Chicago, and had the main stage on to the football field itself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp"  /></p><p>When The Spring Awakening was first announced I was super excited because the (initial) lineup included <b>Markus Schulz</b> and <b>Ferry Corsten</b>, two heavy hitters in Trance.  One of my favorite duos, <b>Gabriel &amp; Dresden</b> were also on the bill.  And <b>Moby</b>, too!  Later on <b>Carl Cox</b> and <b>Green Velvet</b> were also added.</p><p>On the other side of the coin were acts such as Skrillex, Wolfgang Gartner, Laidback Luke, Benny Benassi, Diplo, etc, etc.  I tried to like these guys when they started to become popular, but I can't get into it.  There's no atmosphere, or melody for me to enjoy.  I really don't dig its sound.  It's not relaxing, or uplifting, or groovy.  It doesn't take me on a journey.  Blah blah blah... damn kids.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday</b></div><p>I arrived around 6pm on Saturday.  I took a look around for a while, and proceeded to the "Trance" Tent, aka 'Da Drive Stage' where Morgan Page, Gabriel & Dresden, and Markus Schulz were going to perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp"  /></p><p>Joachim Garraud was already spinning some tunes when I arrived.  There's no way this guy is a real DJ.  The last half of set had so many randomly stereotypical popular songs.  "We are your Friends", "Smack my Bitch up", and "Sandstorm"!  Sandstorm!  In 2012, Sandstorm was played at one of the largest dance events Chicago has ever held.  It blows my mind that anyone would consider playing that song.</p><p>After that horrible experience, Morgan Page hopped on stage and played a rather mediocre set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp"  /></p><p>I had been making my way up to the front throughout Morgan Page's set.  Once he left the stage, he took a lot of the audience with him.  I suppose everyone left for  <b>Ferry Corsten</b> on the main stage, but I stuck around for Gabriel &amp; Dresden.</p><p>Unfortunately, they performed a very standard set.  :/  Out of all their tracks, there was only one that I hadn't heard before.  I had a lot of fun hopping around to all of their recent hits, but there were no surprises whatsoever.  They could've played some amazing classic Trance hit, or wowed everyone with a new Mashup, but it felt like we got the minimal amount of what they were willing to do.  They really phoned it in. :(  What a waste...</p><p>I probably should have joined everyone else for Ferry Corsten, but I still had a good time rocking out to the tunes.  I was right up front, and there was a dude next to me rocking out just as much.  He bought me a couple beers!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1261.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1261.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1266.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1266.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1266.webp"  /></p><p>The absolute best part of the day was when Markus Schulz took over the decks.  He played an absolutely phenomenal set.  Absolutely amazing.  It felt like time literally stopped in the aura of atmosphere he spun with his set.  The vibe never quit, and continued to build and build and build.  It was awe inspiring.  I feel bad for having listened to him on Internet radio for more than 10 years, and JUST NOW seeing him live.  Out of an evening of mediocre and terrible performances, Markus Schulz shined so brightly.</p><p>Horse Head guy was blown away too!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Markus closed out the Trance Tent for the evening, and everyone begun to question whether to outright leave, or go into Soldier Field for Skrillex.  I'll admit that I did like Skrillex in the beginning.  His sound was quite different than everything else.  It was very fresh and distinct.</p><p>But now the industry is completely saturated by imitators and trend-followers.  I listened to Skrillex's set for about 20 minutes, and was surprised how his sound has completely faded into the genre he (somewhat) created.  I thought Skrillex was supposed to be at the front of this sound, but he sounds just like everyone else. it feels like he's having a hard time differentiating himself from his followers.  The only real difference he has is his signature look, and his ridiculous amount of energy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp"  /></p><p>So, I left.  And I didn't go to any of the after parties.  I just went to bed.  Because I'm lame.</p><div class='title'><b>Sunday</b></div><p>On Sunday, I spent a lot of the day running errands around Arlington Heights, and Schaumburg.

It was really easy to get up to the front.</p><p>Derrick Carter's set moved right into <b>Green Velvet</b>.

Smiles all around.</p><p>Throughout the set, Green Velvet got a hold of the mic, and sang vocals with his tracks.

There was plenty of room to rock out.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1633_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1633_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1633_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1633_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1633_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>It was an amazing 3 hours of Derrick Carter, Green Velvet and Carl Cox, and I was front and off-left for the whole thing.  And with Markus Schulz on Saturday, these guys made the weekend worthwhile.</p><p>After Carl Cox, <b>Flux Pavillion</b> took the stage, the vibe to a sharp course change into the Electro House / Dubstep sound.  Bleh...  They should've had <b>Moby</b> directly follow Carl Cox.  Even though, Moby plays a lot of Electro-ish tracks, it would've been a great way to transition out of the monster Techno aura that Carl Cox created.  Flux Pavillion basically threw the vibe away and started from scratch.</p><p>Anyway, I got out of the crowd, and walked around a bit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1648_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1648_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1648_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1648_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1648_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1685_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1685_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1685_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1685_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1685_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1716_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1716_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1716_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1716_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1716_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1787_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1787_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1787_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1787_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1787_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>When I was walking around, I ran into Green Velvet.  That guy can go incognito pretty easily when he puts on a hat, and takes off his sunglasses.

His DJ performances are a stark difference than his original work.  His original work is very ambient and uplifting, whereas his DJ performance are very hard and energetic.</p><p>His DJ performances used to be super super rare, but ever since 'Last Night' in 2008, he's been back in the clubs, and each year he's been DJing more and more.  I came across a couple of his recorded sets, and wrote my impressions about it <a href="/old/v7/moby-djing" title="/moby-djing">here</a>, but I never had the chance to actually hear him live.</p><p>Today was finally the day, and his set turned out exactly how he had portrayed himself in those recordings.  High energy, but overall lacking.  I wouldn't say it lacked individuality, but it's missing something...  for me, anyway.  There's no hook.  There's no...  something.  His sets aren't really memorable.  I don't know.</p><p>Maybe it's just hard for me to separate Moby the artist, from Moby the DJ.  Maybe I'm just giving him a pass because I know he's a good artist.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Anyway, I left before Moby finished his set, so I could return to Madison and get to work the next day.</p><p>Markus Schulz, Derrick Carter, Green Velvet, and Carl Cox made my weekend, and I was quite satisfied.  Gabriel &amp; Dresden were fun, but were a bit disappointing.  Moby was ok, and I missed Ferry Corsten, but other than there were no other DJs and artists I really cared about.</p><p>The Spring Awakening was mostly a festival that mirrored the sound of today's electronic dance generation, and not my own.  That's why I am SUPER excited for the Wavefront Music Festival at the end of June.  This is packed full of the sounds I love, and artists I follow.  I can't wait.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1866.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1866.webp"  /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival - Day 3" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-3">North Coast Music Festival - Day 3</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

DJ Solo opened the Red Bull stage, but the next act I cared to see was Little Dragon at 5:30.  So, Five and I took the train and headed downtown for the afternoon.</p><p>We finally go the chance to visit Wow Bao, an Asian fast food place that Five had wanted to go to for a very long time.  We had some lunch, and took a tour of Grant Park and Millenium Park.  We took pictures of the bean and the fountain.  After that, we headed to Rotofugi to take a look at some art and toys.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_6952_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I love this shot.Â  Mostly because the panoramic assembler magically cropped out that girl's boyfriend.

And everyone threw their hands in the air, and hopped up and down, which created a massive dirt cloud.  Yesterday, the rain and the crowd had turned the park into a mud pit, and today all that mud had dried into dirt.  And now that dirt is in the air, along with all the horrible cigarette smoke.  At least it's 70 today, instead of 90.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7091_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7103_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>ATB's set was pretty vanilla for him.  It was nearly identical to his set from early 2010 in Minneapolis.  He opened with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFhZSo0dbao">ATB - Ecstasy</a>, and followed up with boring trance, all the while sampling (teasing) his classic track <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajdmA7qoYZ4">ATB - 9pm (Till I Come)</a>, which he never fully played.</p><p>ATB is the king of mediocre trance.  There's no way he could follow Andy Moor from last night.  And you could tell he had to fall back on pandering to the crowd when he played the Woo Hoo song (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk">Blur - Song 2</a>).  Really?!</p><p>I find it rather odd that ATB is the only representation of Trance at North Coast, and he's not even that good.  They couldn't find anyone from Armada or Anjuna that wasn't busy this weekend to play some decent trance?  They had Paul van Dyk last year for gods sake...</p><div class='title'><b>Benny Bennasi</b></div><p>ATB finished his horrid set, and left the stage to <b>Benny Bennasi</b>.  His sound was very raw and energetic.  He primary sticks to Electro House, but his sound is very Club House or Big Room or whatever you call it.  Unlike horrible hacks like David Guetta, he kept to a cohesive beat, which makes it actually danceable.  It fits the festival perfectly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7126_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>But I think the weekend had started to takes its toll on me.  After a fantastic Day 1 and 2, with nothing really going on for Day 3, and horrible ATB, I wasn't feeling the vibe at all.  I wanted something that actually spoke to me and set itself apart.</p><p>I stuck around for almost his whole set before wandering around the fest grounds again.  I should have left earlier so I could've caught <b>Of Montreal</b>, but oh well.  I didn't feel like staying for Bassnectar or Thievery Corporation, so I left to find some more delicious Chicago pizza at Gino's East.</p><p>I returned to Union Park just in time to hear the closing sounds of <b>Bassnectar</b> on the main stage, but I was outside of the park at the time.  I was waiting in line for tonight's after party at Transit.</p><div class='title'><b>Steve Bug &amp; Ida Engberg @ Transit</b></div><p>I've been to most clubs in Chicago, but I had never been to Transit before.  It had a very different floor plan than all the places I'm used to.  The only club that I could compare it to is Trinity in Seattle.  It had 3 completely separate rooms stacked with some major underground talent.</p><p>Kate Simko, DJ Heather, and rave-legend Woodie McBride ran things in the red room off to the side.  While a few other Chicago DJs opened for Minneapolis legends Jack Trash and Tyler Hampton in the loft room off to the other side.</p><p>The main room was in the center of the club.  The DJ booth was off to the side, and played itself off as an unimportant decoration.  The real focus was the circular dance floor in the center of the room.  It was aligned with VIP seating, speaker towers, sub woofers, and ceiling speakers.  Once you entered the circle, the sound was immense.  There were very few places you could escape the full wrath of sound.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7169.webp"  /></p><p>This night was incredibly nostalgic for me.  The openers in the main room played the type of House music that I grew up hearing in Minneapolis events.  It felt like all the non-Trance DJs in Minneapolis knew everything there was about House and nothing else.  At the time, I really wasn't into it.  The beat just kept going and going and going.  It changed when tracks changed, but it never really evolved into something else.</p><p>Though, when <b>Steve Bug</b> took over the decks that classic House sound definitely evolved.  It moved from repetition to something more layered and spacey, but kept the classic nature.  He blew those openers out of the fucking water.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7187.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7191.webp"  /></p><p>He is different, and hard to describe.  It like someone switched off the "suck" in the club, and made it awesome.  Those openers weren't in the same league as this guy.  Not even close.  He pounded the club with some jagged smooth beats.  It was definitely a surprise.</p><p>The crowd didn't really seem to notice for some reason.  It was really a somber night for the kids in Transit.  Most of the club was dancing and hanging out, but no one was really whipping them into shape.  The club's layout really didn't put an importance on the DJ, so maybe it was better to create a vibe to enjoy, rather than pander to the crowd and make them pay attention.</p><p>I have a feeling that Steve Bug was holding back just a little bit.  He created an amazing atmosphere, but he wasn't tearing down the place.  I think he left that for <b>Ida Engberg</b>, because the crowd totally changed when she took over.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7211.webp"  /></p><p>She finally showed up around 2am, and started off a track or two that built off of Steve Bug's atmosphere.  It was electric and energetic.  The crowd started hopping up and down, and cheering her on.  So she reciprocated by bringing the thunder.</p><p>The rest of her set tore the place down and everyone went nuts.  Everyone in the whole club was on the dance floor, and completely ignored the DJs in the other rooms.  I didn't even realize there were this many people in the club.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7226.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7182.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110904_chicago/IMG_7235.webp"  /></p><p>I rocked out to her set for about an hour.  I left around 3am, as it had been a long exhausting (amazing) weekend, and I had 150 miles to drive in front of me.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>This had been one of the best weekends out of the year for me.  It's really hard for me to choose between heading to Seattle, visiting Ace &amp; Jess, and attending PAX, versus heading down to Chicago for North Coast.  Both are the best weekends, and I'm really glad PAX was held one week earlier this year.  Last year, I did half North Coast and half PAX and I feel my overall experiences of both were lessened.  This year, I attended the full breadth of both and they really can't compete with each other.</p><p>As mentioned, James Zabiela and Carl Cox were total stand outs for me, along with Ida Engberg and Steve Bug following them up.  I hope that next year, North Coast is able to bring the amount of variety and quality they had this year.  Also, I hope they fucking bring more than ATB to represent trance, ugh...</p><p>In terms of numbers, I read that they were able to get 50,000 people into Union Park this year, which is 10,000 more than last year.  They should have plenty of cash to make next year even bigger.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival - Day 2" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-day-2">North Coast Music Festival - Day 2</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I arrived around 2pm and headed over to the Red Bull stage for <b>Felix Cartal</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6496_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>He performed a great set to start the day.  Housey with some Electro.  An amazing beat with ripe sound.  A perfect build up to Zeds Dead, who performed next.</p><p>I'm not a fan of dubstep at all, but there is some I like, and <b>Zeds Dead</b> fall into that category.  They don't stick with the cookie cutter warble waaahhh.  They iterate on that, and keep a coherent beat.  It's actually danceable!  Maybe that's because they mix in a fair amount of Electro House behind their songs, along with some Drum &amp; Bass.  They threw in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOqdw7duKHg">Skrillex - Reptile Theme</a> near the end of their set.  And ended with a brand new unreleased track.

These guys are a live electronica band.  They play drums and saxophone over a pre-recorded beat, and have a very unique sound.  Some songs are dubsteppy, and others are more dancey.  It's a very 80s/90s feel.  I like it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6572_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6609_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Next up, I went over to the Groupon Stage for <b>Future Rock</b>.  These guys are also a live.  They play synths, guitar and drums.  Their sound is very retro, but they follow a very modern dancey beat.  Very spacey and energetic.  Great Stuff.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6645_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6700_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Here's some video of Future Rock : <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCldbwl6jJ0</a></p><p>They finished up around 6:30, so I started looking for some food.  The festival grounds are lined with several food tents from local restaurants and bars.  I had some egg rolls, and fish and chips.  Delicious and fatty fried foods.  Perfect for filling the stomach.</p><div class='title'><b>Carl Cox</b></div><p>Carl Cox was pretty damn awesome. :). You don't really hear his name much these days, but he's been around since the beginning.  Along with Paul Oakenfold, Sasha and John Digweed.  They built the English dance scene in the 90s.  This is my second time seeing him and it's been almost 10 years.  The first time was for his Global CD tour in 2002.</p><p>It's interesting to see how he's evolved.  He was pretty much straight House back in the day, which is all I heard from the clubs.  As people ages and tastes changed, the pure House sound has become somewhat niche, and I never hear of it anymore.  It seems that Carl Cox has evolved passed that and has become a renaissance man.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6742_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>His set tonight was genre breaking.  While his set was penned in an overall Housey tone, he threw in some Techno and Trance to bring everyone up to speed with the best that is out there.  He played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63rqsFsGlwA">Maxime Dangles - Dhiaiz</a>!!  While it was all over the place, it was cohesive.  It made sense, and worked well.  It was fantastic. :)</p><p>I captured the whole set on video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB2AAA3FD4493EAC1</a></p><p>While James Zabiela rocked my world yesterday, Carl Cox surprised and delighted me.  <b>These 2 guys are the clear highlight of North Coast for me.</b> I almost regret not going to his after party at The Mid.  But his was one of the first to sell out, so that club will be a crowded mess.  And it's usually that way on regular nights, so I think I'm better off heading off to Vision for Andy Moor.</p><div class='title'><b>Fatboy Slim &amp; STS9</b></div><p>Ending the night at the festival was <b>Fatboy Slim</b> headlining.  Unfortunately, he didn't really do anything for me.  Carl Cox completely blew me away, and anything else that followed needed to go further.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have not followed Fatboy Slim's music what so ever.  I know Star 69, but that's about it.  I can't really groove to his sound.  I listened to his promo mix for the Big Beach Festival in Tokyo earlier his year, and it didn't really speak to me, so I figured this performance would end up the same way.</p><p>It was really more of a concert anyway, rather than a DJ set, or even a festival DJ set at that.  But that crowd went absolutely nuts, and that's awesome.  It's good to see a legend of electronic music get the respect he deserves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6759_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6789.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6782.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6798.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6805.webp"  /></p><p>I took off a little early and listened to <b>STS9</b> for a little while, but they didn't really grab me either.

Hell yeah.</p><p>For the first time, We took the train into town rather than spend $20 or $30 on parking.  SO MUCH CHEAPER.  $2.75 train in town, $15 cab back to the car.  If we planned it better, we could've taken the train back.  This is my plan next time.</p><p>Anyway, we arrived at Vision around to some lack luster trance openers.  They played a few popular anthems, but kept the vibe in control and ready for The main act.</p><p>Andy Moor took the stage around 2am, I think.  He started off quite solid.  I didn't recognize many of the tracks, but it was a solid vibe.  He kept the energy up, and never fell into that stereotypical trance pattern.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110903_chicago/IMG_6862.webp"  /></p><p>About an hour in, things began to change.

While it's not really my favorite song, it is the type of song that EVERYONE knows.  The entire crowd erupted in song and dance.  The track that followed set the tone for the rest of the night.  Raw and powerful.  I should have recorded it, so I could ID it later.  It rocked my world.</p><p>For the next two hours, he pulled out some mighty bangers.

After picking up the car from the rental place, I was on the road around 2pm.  Not terrible, but it put me in the throws of Chicago gridlock.  After checking into the motel and forgetting I was supposed to go to Union Park (not Wicker Park), I got there in time to hear the last 15 minutes of Zabiela's set.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6284_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Man, <b>James Zabiela</b> was on fire.  I haven't heard any breaks in a long time, and it's so refreshing to hear them as crisp as I remember.  I'm totally excited for his after-party tonight at Sound Bar.  I was pretty sad that the crowd was so sparse, but those that were there were hanging on each break he threw down.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6295_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6327_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>I took a bunch of pictures, but wasn't able to get video.  Afterward, I wandered around the festival grounds, looking at the vendors and their merchandise.  One of them had some beautiful trippy tapestries for super cheap, so I bought one. :)</p><p>I waited around the North Coast stage for Wolfgang, and listened to <b>Sbtrkt</b>'s opening set.  I thought it was pretty good.  Not my kind of music, bit it definitely had groove to it.  Nice and smooth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6337_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6350_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>He finished, and the roadies started setting up the stage for <b>Wolfgang Gartner</b>.  10 minutes he hopped on stage to NO sound.  It took them a couple of minutes to fix that, and then he was off.  His set included many of his hits, so it felt much like a concert than a DJ set.  His filler tracks were not for me... I thought I liked this guy, but his set was very uninspired.  No where near what his essential sounded like.  It was pretty disappointing...  though maybe he was nervous and played it safe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6389_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Here's the first 16 minutes of him on stage: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Gz0g8of4g</a></p><p>While he was jammin his hits, the crowd began to grow immensely.  There was a good amount of area to move at the start, but after 15 minutes, it was wall to wall bodies.  Hot sweaty half-naked bodies dripping with sweat from the 90, 95 degree weather.  I wore the wrong clothes to this pit, so I got out of the crowd to avoid drenching my night club garb.</p><p>Wolfgang finished his set in an hour with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDt-iPEVZ4Q">Wolfgang Gartner - Undertaker</a>, then exited the stage to make way for <b>David Guetta</b>.  David Guetta is a horrible sellout producer who doesn't know how to DJ.  He can sequence songs, but everyone can do that these days.</p><p>He got up on stage and starting blaring the most generic EDM.  It was probably some track he's known for.  The words "Nothing but the beat" scrolled on the LCD display, so that can probably ID the song.  As the song built, he constantly interrupted the track by telling the crowd how this is his biggest gig in Chicago, and how we're all lucky, or whatever.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6399_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>As soon as the generic beat dropped, I took off.  I don't need to hear this.  Also, the weather was quite nauseating.  It was 90 some degrees with absolutely NO wind, so all the cigarette smoke stayed around the entire crowd.  From the setting, you'd think the were blowing smoke machines, but it was all disgusting cigarettes.  The worst smell in the world, coupled with some of the most horrible sounds in the world.</p><p>So, I left and went to Lou Malnati's for my favorite Chicago pizza, before heading back downtown for Zabiela's after party.</p><div class='title'><b>James Zabiela @ Sound-Bar</b></div><p>After eating a whole deepdish pizza, I took off for downtown and made it to the Sound-bar line around 11pm.  I was met by a line around the block, and it took about 50 minutes to make it into the club.  I finally made it in around Midnight, and had to pay a $10 cover, but it was worth it.</p><p>Sound Bar was exactly how I remembered it.  This place had not changed in the last 7 years.  Speakers lined the entire dance floor, so no matter where you were, you were standing in the best spot to hear the music.  And it is loud.  SO LOUD.  But the music is still crystal clear.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6414.webp"  /></p><p>As I entered, there was a couple in the booth tag teamin opening duties.  It was pretty cute, and they played some of the smoothest Prog House, including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9O5yOAfEwA">David August - Hamburg is for Lovers</a>.  The set already felt close to Sasha's Never say Never sound, but the plucked that one directly from his latest Usiaha set.  Man, I love that song.</p><p>Halfway through, the guy took over for a couple songs and ramped up the intensity.  One of the songs was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ysc7cC2GI8">Moby - Raining again (Steve Angello Remix)</a>.  Once the girl got control of the decks, she seemed a little annoyed and quickly pulled it back into an amazing groove.</p><p>These two were pretty awesome.  I must know their names.  They continued until 1:30-ish, when James Zabiela took stage.  It took him a little while to set up his stuff, and around 1:45, he began.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6439.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6444.webp"  /></p><p>His set was incredible.  High energy, but not offense or pandering.  Several songs came from Sasha and John Digweed's playlist.  I recognized some of them, but the only one I could ID was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YtWG-qU1jw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YtWG-qU1jw">Layo &amp; Bushwacka - What do you say Now</a>.</p><p>He threw in plenty of effects on top of the normal tracks with his iPad, and some other toys.  And he played a couple break tracks LIVE too!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6453.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110902_chicago/IMG_6454.webp"  /></p><p>I recorded the first hour and a half of his set, but stopped to take some pictures and enjoy his fantastic set.  Here's a link to the video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0CFA9A062024D3B0</a></p><p>Overall, this night was fantastic.  Last year, The Chemical Brothers rocked my world, and last night, it was James Zabiela.  It was definitely one of my top 5 music experiences of the year, alongside Sasha, Digweed, Shpongle, and OTT.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to North Coast Music Festival Schedule" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/north-coast-music-festival-schedule">North Coast Music Festival Schedule</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
