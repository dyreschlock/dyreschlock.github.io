| August 7, 2007 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last weekend, Mitsuwa had their annual Bon Odori Dancing festival.  The Bon festival is typically the festival of the dead that which citizens remember their loved ones.  Nagasaki has a pretty elaborate Bon festival that spans 3 days.  One of the shrines from Suwa Shrine is brought down to the Harbor where it is clearly visible for the spirits to gather and collect amongst the living.  Loved ones can go to the Harbor and see their loved ones who had died over the past year.  On the third day, loved ones light a candle in a little paper boat and send it down the river to guide the spirit through the River Styx.</p><p>Something like that anyways..  This was one festival, I wish I was still over there to see.  Bon festivals take place towards the end of Summer.  Typically sometime between the end of July and the beginning of September.  Nagasaki's Bon festival takes place in the middle of august.  Around the same time, St. Paul, Minnesota also celebrates Nagasaki's Bon festival, since they are "sister cities," which makes it a great excuse to go home and visit my parents.</p><p>Anywho.. Mitsuwa changes this a little bit by adding 'Odori', which is 'to dance.' Mitsuwa's Bon Odori festival was more of the celebration of life, than the remembrance of the dead.  I wonder what region this change originated from.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0037.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0039.webp" /></p><p>Mitsuwa had a pretty damn big turnout.  It reminded me a lot of our school's festival in Japan, but with a lot less participation.  Mitsuwa had a larger turnout with less to do.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0041.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0041.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0041.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0042.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0042.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0042.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0043.webp" /></p><p>Inside was pretty packed too.  Several stands were setup showcasing some of Japanese greatest festival food items, such as Okunomiyaki and Yakisoba..  No squid on a stick, though :/</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0047.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0029.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070804_mitsuwa/100_0034.webp" /></p><p>The real show was the stage outside in the parking lot.  They switched off between traditional japanese stuff, and uninspired contests.  They had Chicago's professional Taiko Drummasters, and Chicago's Okinawan dancers.</p><p>I was really disappointed they didn't have Soran and Yosakoi.  These were the two traditional dances that Maki, Mika, Natchan, and Mayu taught us foreigners.  Perhaps, in one years time, I will assembled a Soran team of my own and bring this time honored tradition to Mitsuwa.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun.  It was really cute to see so many kids having a great time, and it was great seeing everyone in a festival type mood.</p><p>They really need more food vendors and parlor games to bring the essence of a japanese festival to life, though.  I guess too many people have real jobs.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Penguin Aquarium" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/penguin-aquarium">Penguin Aquarium</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 8, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Oh man.. today was a day like no other.  I don't think i've mentioned that Nagasaki has a penguin aquarium have i?  We had made tentative plans to visit said penguins, but the kunchi festival was in our way a little bit.  Despite kunchi, people still planned on going to the penguin aquarium, so Brian and I planned on doing the same.  We tried to locate those individuals planning on going, but they seemed to have disappeared.  "Screw it..  let's go there anyways.  We're on a mission from god," i motivated Brian.  "hell yeah..  penguins here we come."</p><p>Unlike most tourist attractions in Nagasaki, the penguin is way of the east side.  Pretty much as far east as we are north of the central downtown area.  It takes me about 40 minutes to walk to the Densha, and another 20 minutes from there downtown.  It's faster by bus, but also more expensive.  My masterful navigational, kanji recognition, and common sense skills would be my best tools today as we dared to take a bus somewhere far away.  We rode the Densha as far east as it would go, and then began looking for buses.</p><p>Well lets see....  the bus schedule had one bus that was far more popular than the others.  It had 3 or 4 stops at our location an hour, compared to others which stopped by once every two hours.  I figured this had to be our mark, since the bus system has a real strict sense of direction.  I double checked my map to be sure, and sure enough.  The kanji for the penguin aquarium was the same for a notable bus stop on this route.   huzzah.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04692.webp" /></p><p>I hadn't ventured this far east yet, so there was alot of beautiful landscape that i hadn't yet capture on film.  Plus it was boring waiting 20 minutes for the bus to arrive at our stop.  To pass the time, i attempted to figure out where all these buses were actually going.  There's some much Nagasaki east, that i really didn't know what was out there, or ever how to get there.</p><p>As soon as the bus came, we were whisked away on the highway of love.  The road connected nagasaki downtown to its East was cut into the side of several mountains, so one side of the bus had a fantastic view down to into the river valley.  We even went by another hydroelectric plant that collected a large amount of mountain from the mountains ahead.  Hydroelectric, Wind and Solar along with some Natural Gas have been Nagasaki's greatest power sources.  I've come across two dams that must generate a massive amount of electricity.</p><p>The bus continued past the dammed lake and into a tunnel within one of the protective mountains.  It was a rather long tunnel, actually.  A minute later we emerged alongside the Nagasaki ByPass that connects Nagasaki to the rest of Kyushu.  The ByPass goes through Isahaya and onto Fukuoka, eventually.  The ByPass was suspended above the valley on a massive bridge.  Both sides of the bridge were tunnels within the neighboring mountains.  Our bus continued along the road the winded alongside both of the mountains and continued onto the city below us.  East Nagasaki was really quite separated from its' parent counter part.  Mountains seem to have that effect.</p><p>The view was extraordinary.  Below us was the city that extended right to the beach of the bay.  From there, the water went on to the horizon and met up with more mountains of japan opposite the bay.  The terrain of japan is so beautiful.. there's really nothing like it in America.  Sure we have mountains, but they aren't sandwiched between sea and ocean, nor is the sea sandwiches between mountain and forest.  The sealine is so jagged, that you'll always see more land after a vast body of water.  If only there was enough time to explore it all.</p><p>The bus descended down the road into the lower city.  Brian noticed several road signs indicated the aquarium ahead, so we got off the bus.  Our fare was 270 yen, i think.  Rather pricey.  We followed signs and came across our destination:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04694.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04695.webp" /></p><p>Penguins lay inside that very structure, i thought to myself.  The aquarium was so kind as to have a vending machine outside to purchase your tickets from.  Vending machines have an inherit flaw though...  They cannot take a Student ID and give you a discount.  Therefore, we went over to information and inquired to it's existance.  For some reason, the penguin aquarium doesn't have a student discount.  What kind of crock is that...  It's a fricken Aquarium.  This building bleeds learning.  Whatever, we paid our $5 entrance fee and hopped inside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04696.webp" /></p><p>Poised in the entrance, was a massive tank of fish used to feed the hungry flightless birds.  The silver fish shimmered in the light and moved about in a very wave-like motion.  It was alot like what you'd see on the discovery channel, but screw that... i'm looking for penguins!</p><p>Opposite the food tank, was the bottom portion of the King penguin tank.  Several penguins would swim down looking for food in the 6 meter deep tank.  Some would play with each other in the form of tag.  Others would just move around for the fun of it.  I think the really up the mercury levels in the fish they feed these penguins because they seemed pretty uncaring of their whole tanked imprisonment.</p><p>Off to the side was more interesting sea creatures.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04709.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04711.webp" /></p><p>There were a ton of weird looking fish from the deeps of the ocean swimming around in a very crowded tank.  The stingray made quick movements though, despite the overpopulation.  There was this HUGE 6 foot long fish though that must've been bored out of his mind.  I mean, this picture was probably taken on a good day.  He should just kill all the other fish for the hell of it.  Then things would get interesting.</p><p>Downstairs was kinda boring so we went upstairs for some actual penguin action.  Besides the top of the king penguin tank, the walls were filled with exotic underwater creatures.

Little ones, fat ones, short ones, tall ones, but all cute and all penguin.  These little guys were far more energetic than the emperor penguins..  Maybe that's because they were outside in the sunlight, rather than inside.</p><p>Just then an announcement occured, "Penguin Touching today at 2"  Oh sweet mercelious glee, you get to pet penguins!  We walked outside and stood in line:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04764.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04764.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04764.webp" /></p><p>In line, i told Brian the story of how one of my friends got to pet a penguin on one of her news shoots.  "now i've one-upped her, since i've also got to pet a penguin, but in japan!".  Brian replied, "no no no, you've got to go a little bit beyond that.  you've got to completely one-up her."  I thought for a moment.. "alright..  how about you distract the attendents, and i'll punch that little penguin over there.  I don't think she'll be able to one-up getting thrown out of a Japanese aquarium."</p><p>Oh hilarious gander..  As we approached the penguin pen, it was almost our time for the petting!  There were two penguins in the pen, and they alternated who got to go to which penguin.  The little kid before us went over to the one of the right.  He was so elated to see such a magnificent creature up close.  The penguin, on the other hand, didn't have the same reaction, and bit the kid's petting hand.</p><p>We went over to the other penguin that wasn't so bitey.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04766.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04766.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061008_penguin/DSC04766.webp" /></p><p>Whoo hooo!

| October 7, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Today was rather entertaining..  It all began around Noon o'clock when Brian and I arrived at the nagasaki station to meet up with the other americans for a fun filled day of kunchi.  Once we met up with everyone, we took off to the Suwa Shrine, exactly where brian and i were last night.  Most everyone took the train, but that was far too good for us.  The gods gave us these fancy walking legs for a reason.  Several people followed us and we made way to the Suwa Shrine.  We took a little short cut, and came across a convience store.</p><p>"This would be the start of a most beautiful day," i thought as we all piled into the convience store and picked up some more Beer.  Whooo hooo, 2 more stickers closer to that TV watch.  We regrouped outside, and continued to the top of the suwa shrine where we met up with everyone.  There was a liquor store right outside the shrine where most of the students bought some provisions.  As Brian, Morgan and I finished up the booze we had purchased 10 minutes prior, we began to ponder..  "hmmmm...   let's access the situation.  the plan is to stand in line for the next 3 hours to get free tickets into this thing and we just finished up our beers..  uh... HOLY CRAP. festival stuff"</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04332.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04339.webp" /></p><p>and there they go.  These are the monks of the temple, bringing the money offering chests down from the Suwa Shrine, continuing through the city and arriving at the harbor.  Following them would be the 3 shrines of the gods, brought from the Suwa Shrine to the harbor.  During kunchi, festival it is said that the gods are confused and cannot find their way back to the temple.  Therefore those who are clensed must bring the shrines down to the harbor in an open area for the gods to find their way back to the temple easier..  The shrines will stay at the harbor for two days, and then brought back to the temple.</p><p>I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit, because i have pictures of that...  First off, Morgan, Brian and I figured that we should just stop thinking about running back to the convience store to get booze and just fricken do it.  We broke away from the pack, and got our asses to the convience store.  I pick up another 3 beers, and added the stickers to my card.  Whooo...  now i have 7 or so stickers.  It seems we weren't the only ones that thought alcohol was a great idea at 1pm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04342.webp" /></p><p>This monk picked up some tall boys, while Morgan and Brian decided to be a bit more creative with their drinking.  The both bought 2 liters of orange juice and some cheap $5 vodka.  I finished off one beer pretty quick, and we dashed back to the top of the Shrine.</p><p>We got inside the open area and began to wait for the clensed souls to carry the 3 portable shrines down from the shrine and on-way to the harbor.  Everyone was quite impressed with the ingenuity of Brian and Morgan, as i finished off my second beer.  "Whoooo... kunchi festival," i said celebrating the day.  "Hey, here comes the shrine guys..  Imma gettin' a closer look."  I stumbled down the steps all the way to the front, to snap a couple of pics:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04352.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04356.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04361.webp" /></p><p>Everyone took off after the shrines as they were transported down the long staircase to the streets below.  Now, rather than following the shrines all the way to the harbor, we were to stand in line in the shrine area, itself, to nab ourselves some free tickets for the kunchi show.  After running after the shrines, everyone sort of left me and went to the line, so i had to play a little catch up.  I climbed back into the stands, and went back to where we had entered.  Empty..  ok.  They weren't that far way though, they were just up the street and around the corner in line.  It was pretty easy to find actually.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04362.webp" /></p><p>Oh yeah, baby.  Nearly front of the line.  We are totally going to get free tickets.  As i got to my place in line, Brian handed me my third beer which i had left where i was sitting earlier.  "Whoo hoo...  let's all get drunk in the hot hot sun," i suggested.  Since we weren't going anywhere, the other students had already caught on this idea.  Alex started working on his 6 pack, and others began working on their beers too.  Wheee..  It just so happens that quite a bit of people were drinking their delicious Asahi, so i was able to fill in some more stickers on my Beer card.   Oh man...  we've hardly seen anything and kunchi festival already kicks ass.</p><p>A whole lot of line sitting..  I took a panoramic to commemorate the day: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04378.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04378.webp">whee</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04379.webp" /></p><p>"Alright!  The line is beginning to move..  now the simple task of standing up... I .. uh... whooooaaa...  yeah, i'm good."  In case you're wondering, Beer is a bit more alcoholic in japan.  Even the cheap stuff.  So 5 beers is a pretty good investment for some entertainment.  Especially the big cans, which i had purchased.</p><p>"Yosh!..  now we've got our free tickets and get to sit down on the steps."  ugh...  These are solid stone steps, and they stuffed in as many people as possible.  My ass did not appreciate the rock hard surface that it's soft gluttoness cheeks had to be placed upon.  The event was to begin around 4pm, and we sat down around 3pm.  I took some more panoramic shots as the stands began to fill with more and more people:  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04388.webp">one</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04399.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04399.webp">two</a>.  Wheee...</p><p>I got Five an extra ticket, so he joined us as soon as he could.  Around 4pm the event began.  I took about 300 pictures of the actual kunchi, but each, in itself, was rather boring.  It was the same view, from the same spot, far away.  You can't see any detail, nor anything really compelling.  So..  instead of maticulously going through the photos to pick out the best ones, i decided, there and then, to combine them all into an Animated gif.  Perhaps 300 bad pictures could produce something rather remarkable.  So here it is:</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04676.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04676.webp">Kunchi Festival 2006</a> (11.6 mb)</p><p>This takes place over 3 hours beginning at 4pm.  It consists of all 6 acts of the kunchi festival; however, the first couple are a little nerfed because i got REALLY tired of dragging and positioning all these photos half-way through.  The ending acts are better anyways..</p><p>Each act begins with the kasaboko, an umbrella-like portable shrine in which a single person carries and spins it around.  They do switch out the people, so it's not the same guy.  The quality of this performance is measured by the height of the kasaboko, and amount of spins the person can do.  This part is rather boring since it's just a guy spinning around in circles.  After each performance, the crowd yells out, "motekoi! motekoi!" or...  "one more time! one more time!"  it's an encore, though it's really annoying.  Why would you want to see the same thing get spun around again?  It's boring, get on with something else.</p><p>The first performance was a song and dance routine.  It had geisha...  I don't really remember much else.  Right before this dance routine, several ushers began throwing bandanas in the crowd.  Duuuude.  Bandanas!  We were so high up though, there's no way one of those old guys could get it to me.  Sigh...</p><p>The next neighborhood's routine was a bit more entertaining.  After their kasaboko spun around and got off stage, the neighbor men wheeled out a gigantic ship in which children played music while riding.  The routine seemed to tell the story of a fisherman out at sea catching fish rather successfully.  Each of neighborhoodsmen wore their specially designed kimonos which represented waves in the ocean.  It's rather beautiful if you look close enough.  The movement of the men moving the ship represent waves crashing against it and moving it about the ocean.  After the child caught his fish, it was time for the 'waves' to do there thing... but first, the usher's began throwing bandanas into the crowd again.  This time there was an usher right next to us.  Duuude.  I tried to grab one, but alas, None were thrown to me.</p><p>Anywho... the 'waves' moved around the boat a couple times, then were called back.  Moved the ship around, called back, moved ship, called back, moved ship, and finally left.  Wheee... spinning a ship is so cool.</p><p>The next neighborhood's routine was probably my favorite of the night.  This is the dance of the foreignors.  Once again!  Before the dance began, the ushers began throwing out bandanas.  The first throw went right into Morgan and Five, so they scooped some up rather easily.  I, once again, missed out.  "This is going to take drastic measures," i thought.  "i'm totally going to get a banner before the day is done."</p><p>Anyways, those townspeople dressed as chinese began doing a chinese dance.  It was very syncronized and flowed quite well.  The real amazing part of the show were the two solitary dutchmen.  This is now as the dutchmen clown dance, and was developed while the japanese were fascinated by the westerners weird ways.  They thought they looked like clowns in their weird outfits and crazy customs.  Even though this dance really rips of the dutch, the dutch see it as a sign of admiration and honor.</p><p>The next neighborhood did another song and spin the ship routine.  This time i totally eyeballed the usher on his way down to sit next to us.  I was TOTALLY going to get a bandana this time.  All the townspeople came out and bowed, then performers began singing.  The usher got up and began throwing out bandanas..  "OOOOIIIIII!!!!" i yelled.  "OOOIIII!!!!!" as loud and annoyingly as i could.  Kyle and Five could not help but burst into laughter at my over the top attention getter.  However, it was totally ineffective.  The bastard didn't even throw anything near me.  ugh....</p><p>The neighborhood spun around their ship as the sunset.  "mottekoi!..  mottekoi!"  again and again and again and again...</p><p>The next neighborhood would performance a song and dance rountine that hadn't been performed in the last 41 years.  Come to think of it, the last time it was performed was the last year that an emperor to the thrown had been born.  I was wonder if that's significant...  Anywho, once again, i totally eye-balled the usher coming down the aisle with a new basket full of bandanas.  By now, Five had taken a look at his bandana.  Each bandana had been a specific bandana for the performance about to be given.  Five and Morgan both got the Dutchmen dance bandana.</p><p>Once the townspeople bowed and presented themselves, the bandanas flew..  "OOOOIIIIII!!!!!  DAMMIT! OOOOIIIII!!!!  OVER HERE!".  Five and Kyle cracked up again, but i wasn't laughing.  A spray of bandanas flew past me quite out of grasp.    "FUCK!!...  well whatever.  There's one dance left, and it's the most significant out of them all.  By every fiber in my being, i was get that fucker's attention and cletch victoly..  VICTOLY!!!"  Anyways, i really don't even remember this dance, so i guess there was a reason it hadn't been done in the past 41 years.  Though, that didn't stop the audience from yelling out that lovable phrase, "motekoi! motekoi!"</p><p>Once, they retreated down the steps of Suwa Shrine it was time for the fated hour: the whale dance.  Their kasaboko came out into the open spinning around.  The same kasaboko i had seen early in the week on Tuesday.  It was rather beautiful in the lit up realm of the shrine basen.  There he is...  There's that usher.  My eyes was dead set on the usher to my right.  I paid close attention to his every move, and bid my time for him to rise and begin chucking the bandanas into the audience.</p><p>Once the kasaboko retreated down the steps, the townspeople brought out several transporting boats representing a starving village.  The history of the whale dance is that a starving town would prey to the gods to bring them food.  Everyday they would set up fishing, but would catch nothing.  Enividably, they would put all there resources into hunting down a whale that would feed their villages for the entire winter.  Something like that, anyways...  The little kid yelled out his chant, as the townspeople recanted the phrase with a booming sound.  It was quite powerful.  The song had ended, and the ships began to vacate the arena.  That's right usher, i've got my eye on you.  The first sign of movement, and you know exactly what you're going to hear.  The townspeople bring out the whale to spin around, and usher began his stand.</p><p>"OOoOOOOOOOIiIIiIII!!!!!  DAMMIT!" i screamed as to cletch my hands on a whale bandana.  Come to think of it, my little story here is somewhat similar to the town's story.  All they need is that whale to feed their town and they would be full of riches, though the whale is elusive.  It's difficult to catch and even more difficult to keep.  "OOOOOoOOOOOIIIII!!!  Throw some of those things over heeerreeeeyyaaaa!!!"  An opportunity, a spray of bandana went aloft over our pearched seats.  I saw the fabled bandana drift through the sky across the people and within my grasp..  I extended my arm and.....</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04641.webp" /></p><p>YOINK!  fuck yeah!  I plucked the spinning shimmering bandana from the sky and closed my hand tight.  Oh yeah baby..  cubs win! cubs win!  Truthfully, i think it was drifting toward a little kid, but screw that.  This was destiny.  The destiny of a very tall guy who could reach over everyone else and grab something floating in the sky.  Such as it is.  Another such bandana went directly to Kyle, sitting right next to me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04640.webp" /></p><p>I think Ryan got one of these bandanas too.  Anywho, with the tossing of the bandanas complete, it was time to watch the dance of the whale.  The dance was special because our very own history professor, Seb, was the first non-japanese person ever to take part in the kunchi festival.  He married into this neighbor, and since has become a shinning icon of cultural sharing, understanding, and prosperity.  So many others not part of Nagasaki had been pushed away from and shunned from taking part in the festival, but Seb is such a master of the japanese culture..  he is the chosen one.</p><p>But yes, they spun around the whale a couple times.  The whale is also unique, as inside, two men pump water from the whale into the sky.  It's a real eye catcher compared to the ships which don't really have moving parts.  Off to the side, was the whale's boats though with children playing the song of the whale.  Encore, after encore, after encore, after encore, the whale spun itself around and shot water into the sky.</p><p>I was rather impressed by the festival.  I thought it was pretty neat to see such an old tradition continue today was such an awesome amount of support from the entire Nagasaki city.  Once the whale exited, everyone got up and began to leave.  Five, Kyle and I ventured to the shrine area to look around.  The actually shrine area was quite empty without the 3 shrines..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04678.webp" /></p><p>We had already lost everyone else at this point, so Five recommended we check out this restaurant of his in Hananomachi.  "Sure sounds good.  After a kick ass day of festivals, boozing, bandanas, and rudely yelling my head off, i'm quite hungry."</p><p>In Hananomachi, we came across one of the ships from the kunchi festival that was giving respect to those businesses that had supported it throughout training, niwamise, and everything really..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04687.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04688.webp" /></p><p>"Whoooo...  i'm hungry."  The restaurant Five brought us to was extremely quaint.  It was a very small two story area, with a bar downstairs and seating upstairs.  The speciality of this restaurant is Gyooza, which is alot like a pot-sticker.  We had 6 orders of Gyooza, and 2 orders of this egg stuff, i forgot the name.  The gyooza was pretty tasty, though i don't really think they constitute as a meal.  It kinda reminds me of eating a bag of Doritos for dinner.  The egg stuff was also pretty good, but equally non-filling.  To be fair, it was about 9pm, and i hadn't eaten all day, so nothing of this magnitude would really fill me up.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061007_kunchi/DSC04691.webp" /></p><p>I should really buy some eggs and vegetables and make something delicious too.  This restaurant also needed to leave a picture of water at the table so we could actually quench our thirst, rather than build it.  Luckily, we did leave about the same time a whole rush of people entered.</p><p>We stopped off at a convience store to grab some drinks.  I picked up another beer since it's cheaper than anything else, really.  Huzzah!  Sticker #18  I'm halfway to my TV Watch... whee!</p><p>That was pretty much the end to an awesome day of kunchi.  Bandana bitches!  I played a quick game of DDR at taito on the way home to discover that they changed the amount of songs from 3 to 4 for 100 yen.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ura Kunchi" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ura-kunchi">Ura Kunchi</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 6, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As mentioned earlier, this weekend is the illustrious Kunchi festival: the festival of festivals.  Mark had announced a timeline of events in class and tonight was Ura Kunchi.  A festival of amatuers and other neighborhoods not scheduled to partipate in this year's event, but hold an event of their own for the gods.  This was down at the Suwa Shrine, so brian and i left dance club earlier to go check it out.  We stopped off at mcdonalds on the way down there..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04278.webp" /></p><p>This is what a japanese mcdonalds looks like by the way.  Pretty much the same as an American mcdonalds, except in japanese and more expensive.</p><p>Anywho, we took the train car downtown and arrived at the Suwa Shrine.  The Suwa Shrine was laced with paper talismen and glowing laterns.  It was rather festive, as the times had called for.  We made our way to the top, but were certainly aware of the inactivity.  Nothing really seemed to be going on at the moment.  In fact, the vendors weren't even selling anything yet.</p><p>We reached the summit of the staircase to an empty showcase where the ura kunchi was supposed to take place.  This had certainly conflicted with our given information.  We began to inquire as to the where abouts of ura kunchi.  We asked a nearby police man why nothing was here.  30 minutes and bad japanese later, we were informed that no such event was taking place at Suwa Shrine.  sigh....</p><p>Well... whatcha gonna do.  Ura kunchi was a bust.  Such a downer requires the consumption of alcohol.  Brian and I hit the local convience store at the bottom of the hill and picked up a couple cans of the cheap, yet delicious Asahi.  We also began filling out our Beer cards too.  Most cans of Asahi have a little sticker placed on the outer aluminum shell.  This little sticker is to be removed, and placed on a Beer card.  Each beer card holds 36 stickers.  A complete Beer card can be sent in for a chance to win 1 of 5000 TV watches!  Duuuude.  Whoever said that drinking beer didn't get you anything, was WRONG!</p><p>Anyways, with our beers in hand and cards stickered, we simply began walking around town since there wasn't anything else to do.  We found a poster for the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04299.webp">Densha Otoko</a> movie.  Unfortunately, all the movies inside this video store were mostly disney or at most PG.  There was no porn, which i was hoping for.  We also came across the kunchi festival grounds near the city hall:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04302.webp" /></p><p>We continued along the main road and came to Hananomachi.  Walked around a bit looking for anything of interest.  There was a stray cat hanging out near some benches</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04316.webp" /></p><p>and another one, eating some scraps of food lying around the ground:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04326.webp" /></p><p>eechh...  That white cat is rather ugly.  Unfortunately, i did not have any sticks nearby to poke it with, or else it would have gotten what for.  Actually, i think what the cat really needs is some food.  I should've ran into the dollar store and gotten some delicious treats that the cat could've feasted upon.  Then it would've been the king of stray cats.  KING!  Actually, it probably would've died from overeating.</p><p>The dollar store did have a rather useful tool though:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04319.webp" /></p><p>A fake security camera.  With this device you can fool pedestrians into thinking that you are keeping a close watchful eye on the exterior of your home.  Simply screw this plastic camera into an overhang and input 2 AA batteries.  The batteries will light up the red LED light posed on the front of the camera to complete the full effect.  No burgler will dare try to break in with this clearly visible security camera stalking his every move.</p><p>suckers...  it's only 4 whole dollars.  a great investment for what may be potentially stolen..  Can you really put a price on that?</p><p>Let's see here...  the book store had copies of a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04317.webp">Digital Devil Saga</a> novel...  and also a very graphic book on this year's <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04318.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061006_prekunchi/DSC04318.webp">kunchi festival dances</a>.  It had paintings of each dance for this year.</p><p>Oh well.. today was a bust, but i did run into some cute little cats.  Tomorrow is the actual kunchi festival.</p><p>On another note, i got my refund of $1000 from going to the dorms rather than a host family. Whoooo... let the good times roll.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Niwamise in Hana no Machi" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/niwamise-in-hana-no-machi">Niwamise in Hana no Machi</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| October 3, 2006 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Nagasaki is pretty much the party town of Japan.  During the persecution of Christianity across Japan, the city had money coming in from two directions.  Nagasaki was still making quite a bit of money from the Chinese, since they were the premiere Trading city of Japan.  Nagasaki also got quite a bit of money from the Japanese Government, to simply NOT be christian and go about your daily life being Japanese.</p><p>So many shogun and lords became so rich, that they didn't know what to do with the money.  They began having festivals all the time to spend their money on, and the tradition continues to this day.</p><p>This weekend is the Kunchi festival, which is basically the festivel of festivals.  For the festival, certain neighborhoods across Nagasaki, before a song and dance act to display at the Kunchi festival.  Last night was Niwamise, the showcase of the neighborhoods costumes and equipment for their performance this coming weekend.  During this time, the group performing the act was receive gifts from all the neighborhood's residents in appreciation of their hardwork, dedication, and spirit.</p><p>Our history professor is participating is the Whale dance, so he advertised it a bit downtown.  He's from britain and his wife is from this neighborhood, so through that connection he was able to participate.  He'll be the first non-japanese descent person to participate in the dance.  It's rather exciting.</p><p>Brian and I took off from the dorm around 7pm and went downtown to check it out. ^_^</p><p>As we got downtown, All those lanterns in China town were lit up, so we stopped off there first.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04170.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04170.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04166.webp" /></p><p>Sebastian, our history professor, said that we wouldn't be able to miss his niwamise.  "Just follow the crowds..."  and he was certainly right about that.  Hana no Machi was packed with all kinds of people.

Quality of the performance is judged on how high it is tossed and how level it is during the airtime.</p><p>We ventured forth to try and find Seb and his kimono's which were on display.  By the way, traditionally the niwamise takes place in the people's homes; however, the city is a bit crowded these days and most people rent out apartments.  For some neighborhoods, you can rent out stores that have contributed to your performance to display your kimono and gifts for the Niwamise.  Seb rented out his store for about $1500.</p><p>We wandered around a bit and asked someone where we could find Seb.  This nice lady helped us out. ^_^  Seb's niwamise had the biggest line and the most stuff inside as well.  I think a bunch of the group pitched in and shared the store.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04182.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04182.webp" /></p><p>In fact, the store wasn't big enough to hold all the gifts they had received.  some of the boxes spilled outdoors:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04184.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04184.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04184.webp" /></p><p>Inside was rather amazing</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04185.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04185.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04185.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04186.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04186.webp" /></p><p>Check it out...

While we were at it, Brian and I bought some beer since public drunken-ness in Japan is A-OK!  We downed the beer pretty quick since japan has a severe lack of random garbage cans around.  After talking a few more pictures, we ventured forth to try and find some more Niwamise across Nagasaki.</p><p>We found ourselves at Dejima Wharf around 9:30pm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04220.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04220.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04220.webp" /></p><p>Dejima Wharf is such a swanky place..  Beautiful music playing in the background..  oh hey, check that out.

"oh dude, there's that hot american dude.  i shall nod to his favor."</p><p>Brian and I continued to Harbor to look for some Niwamise, but no luck.  We came across some japanese floozies though.  "hallo..," they said as we walked by.  We checked out the park:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04225.webp" /></p><p>ugh.. that's a bad photo.  oh well.</p><p>We went back towards the department store to purchase some beer, when the floozies came up to us.  "hi.  where are you from?"  I'm pretty sure that's how ever conversation with a foreign begins here in japan.  We talked back and forth a bit, and asked them where we could find some Niwamise.  They directed us towards Glover Garden.  :shrugs:</p><p>Anywho.. we went into the department store and picked up some more cheap Beer (by japanese standards).  We downed that pretty quick and took off towards Glover Garden.  The grocery store in the department store had some baby ham loafs:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04229.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04229.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04229.webp" /></p><p>We eventually got to Glover Garden where there was NOTHING.  nothing but darkness...  what a waste.  Glover Garden is rather beautiful, but not during the night with everything closed. :/</p><p>We stopped off at another convience store for some more cheap beer, and took off towards home.  The street car was amazingly packed at this time at night.  I should've taken a picture.  We arrived at Sumiyoshi and began the hour long walk back to the dorm.  I found some engrish!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04231.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/061003_niwamise/DSC04231.webp" /></p><p>We also thought it was a pretty good idea to start harassing this lone nerdy-looking japanese guy that was in front of us.  We were making alot of noise, laughing at each other, and he turned around to look at us.  After one look, he faced forward and began walking faster.  So we began walking a bit faster to mess with him.</p><p>He looked back again, and now we were closer before.  ZOMG, he increased his pace.  Therefore we krept up ever quicker.  We stopped playing around though, because we didn't want the police to get involved or something weird.  The kid took off across the street to get away from us. ^_^  MAuahahahaha..  we scared the crap out of him.</p><p>We were rather amused with ourselves.  This helped pass the time.</p><p>When we finally reached home, and i went straight to bed.  Drinking and Walking is quite tiring.  Kunchi is going to freakin' rock.  Prepare your beers.</p><p>By the way... i think the best beer i've found here is this little 12 oz can of Asahi for 125 yen a can.  It's pretty delicious and it's cheap.  That's the best combo one can hope for.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Shopping Arcade" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/shopping-arcade">Shopping Arcade</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

China town is filled with fancy restaurants and beatiful architecture.  This one restaurant had a pretty pond out front with some delicious looking fish:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04132.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04132.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04132.webp" /></p><p>All the food looked so delicious, but i wanted something cheap and delicious, rather than just delicious.

I had some DELICIOUS ramen there.  A huge bowl filled with noodles, meat, and corn.  Oddly enough, it's the first little bit of ramen i've had this whole trip.  I should really have more ^_^.  Instant stuff does not compare to the delicious-ness.</p><p>As we exited the nook, there was a crowd around a little book store.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04141.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04141.webp" /></p><p>Apparently, there was an impromptu showcase of little girl that knew how to play the Piano really really well.  This first girl we saw was amazing, but this second girl got up and just plain sucked.  She wasn't stern enough with her finger pounding so it was too quiet, and the song choice wasn't really all that captivating.  So we took off to look for clothing stores and other places.</p><p>I found some <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04142.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04142.webp">interesting pants</a> in this hip-hop clothing shop:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04143.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04143.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04143.webp" /></p><p>West-side Nagasaki... all the way. I think that one mannequin is doing the shocker.<br/>I finally did find a pretty good engrish shirt on my daily travels:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04144.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04144.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04144.webp" /></p><p>This was really all i could find though.  Truely great Engrish shirts are tough to find around here.  I wonder if its like that for all of japan.  We went in and out of several clothing stores, but it was almost all American clothing.  Oddly enough, Kyle found a shirt from his High School at one of the stores.  What an eerie feeling.</p><p>We came across a store that was alot like Spencer's Gifts.  The had alot of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04145.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04145.webp">Colonel Sander's</a> keychains, a creepy <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04146.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04146.webp">McDonald's hat</a>, and some interesting <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04148.webp">Winter wear</a>.  I don't think those hats would work very well when robbing a bank.</p><p>We went to a few more places but got tired of not finding anything particularly engrish.  I bought some more groceries at the local stores.  Mainly more curry and some instant ramen.  I bought a bowl too so i could actually eat the ramen.</p><p>I was quite delicious ^_^.  here's the ramen i purchased:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04150.webp" /></p><p>It was $1 and it came with enough for 2 people.  It easy to cook, just as any ramen.  Just dump all the contents into a pot or pan:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04151.webp" /></p><p>Cook for a while:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04154.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060930_taito/DSC04154.webp" /></p><p>and viola!

I think american Instant ramen could take a few lessons about NOT deep frying their noodles.  I think if i picked up some eggs and fishcake it would make this the best tasting instant ramen ever made.  Perhaps some spice would help out things too.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Around Sumiyoshi into Nagayo" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/around-sumiyoshi-into-nagayo">Around Sumiyoshi into Nagayo</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The reason they are labeled Death cigarettes is because they are unfiltered, so you get the pure joy of screwing over your lungs.</p><p>Around the corner i saw a little stray cat run by, so i took off after it to snap a picture</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03984.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03984.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03984.webp" /></p><p>This was the best i could take before it took off in the other direction, through traffic, and then between a couple houses.</p><p>I swear...  taking pictures of cats around here is alot like Pokemon Snap for N64.  You have to be quick and cunning to snap the perfect picture, otherwise they'll run away and you'll miss your opportunity.  In other cases, you need to bait them out into the open to get a good shot.  And other cats will just come up to you and hang out without giving a shit.  And in other cases you need to poke them with sticks for fun.</p><p>I proceeded down the road to take a look into the Sumiyoshi You-Ing for some more games.  I found a copy of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03986.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03986.webp">IQ Final</a> for $5, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03987.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03987.webp">Stand Alone Complex</a> Production notes with a sweet cover, and the LE <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03995.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03995.webp">cover for Advent Children</a>.

It was still about 2pm though, so i needed something to do.  I decided to venture forth into the unknown and see where i'd end up..  I took off in the opposite direction, away from the city and places that i knew of..  I came into an intersection, and went underneath a tunnel:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" /></p><p>Besides mountains, naturally, Japan also has quite a bit of tunnels.  We went through about 10 tunnels on over journey from Fukuoka to Nagasaki.</p><p>On the other side of this tunnel was a Hydro electric plant:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" /></p><p>There was a guy on the top of the damn practicing Martial Arts and doing kicks in mid-air.  It reminded me of Rocky for some reason.  This guy was in tip-top physical condition.  After doing all these air kicks, he took off running past me and along the river bed.</p><p>I continued walking towards that direction, since it led back into town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" /></p><p>Probably the most prevalent thing i've learned from studying abroad is the amount of distance one can cover by simply walking.  Besides the 30 minute walk to school each day, i've spent at least 4 hours walking around from here to there.  I'm sure i walk around 5 or 6 miles a day.  When i get home in the night, i'm so fricken tired that i usually just instantly go to bed.</p><p>Anyways, i made my way back to the strip, bought some curry, and went back home.  Here's some panoramic shots i took because i was bored: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04034.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04034.webp">here's the bridge over the train tracks</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04043.webp">here's the Toys R Us</a> near the dorm.<br/>____</p><p>I should be set now that i've picked up a bunch of instant curry and a rice cooker.  I should be able to eat on $2 a day, rather than the $15 i've been spending out until now.</p><p>Instant Curry is rather delicious ^_^.  I've picked up enough for the next week.</p><p>It's quite easy to make as well.  Inside the box is a little silver package.  You stick this into boiling for a little while to cook it.  5 minutes later, it's done ^_^.  Just empty out the package on rice and you're set to eat it.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nagasaki Temples" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nagasaki-temples">Nagasaki Temples</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
