| May 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As a game collector, you eventually come across a game that you simply cannot find.  A game that's not necessary rare, but uncommon.  The only distinction between the two being demand.  This particular game for me is (was) Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.</p><p>DDR Party Collection was released in Dec 2003 as a follow-up and compliment to DDR Extreme.  The arcade version of DDR Extreme had so many songs that the home release couldn't contain them all and they released two games.  DDR Extreme had all the new original songs, plus some favorites.  While DDR Party Collection contained the bulk of the favorites and classics they couldn't pack into DDR Extreme.  It used the exact same engine as DDR Extreme, and had just as many songs!</p><p>We played this game a few times at DDR Nights in college, as Tony had a ROM copy, but I wished someday to own a legitimate copy.   Throughout my Study Abroad in Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  Throughout my yearly vacations to Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  I eventually gave up and decided to buy a copy off ebay, but they were no longer listed!  No one was selling.</p><p>It was <b>one year ago yesterday</b> that I finally found a copy.  My 6 year long quest had finally come to its end in Kumamoto.  And it was a fated encounter...</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto</b></div><p>After Dave and I visited Kagoshima, we traveled North to Kumamoto.  Kumamoto is Kyushu's central prefecture, and it's focal point is the gigantic castle in the dead center of town.  Dave and I were able to visit the castle, but only 30-40 minutes before it closed.  Afterward, we wondered what to do.</p><p>On my map, I had one location written down which was a Geo (video game store) not too far east of the Capitol.  We ventured down the castle hill, and made it to the train station.  We passed some delicious looking restaurants on the way there, but wanted to ensure we got on the train.  When we got to the train station, the train wasn't scheduled to arrive for another 20 or 30 minutes, so we backtracked to this interesting hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</p><div class='title'><b>Choboiyaki</b></div><p>This restaurant served Okonomiyaki, but it's not the type you would expect.  It was definitely prepared in a similar manner, but the pancake was HUGE.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp"  /></p><p>The radius of this pancake is about as large as the diameter should be.  She piled on the cabbage, and smashed it all down into form.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp"  /></p><p>The pancake was flipped over, folded, and cut up into servable pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp"  /></p><p>And like all Okonomiyaki, it was absolutely delicious.  Between her semi-decent english and my horrible Japanese, we were able to talk a little bit about what she was actually making...</p><p>Japan may look somewhat small, especially compared to the United States, but it is incredibly diverse.  As a country, Japan grew from isolation, and that isolation spread to its culture, and it culture is known for taking elements of other culture, assimilating them, and expanding on them.  So you get plenty of local cultural traits you won't find anywhere else.  And this especially applies to food.</p><p>This particular version of Okonomiyaki is only local to Kumamoto and is known as Choboiyaki.  At least I think that's what she said.  Here's a pic of the menu with the name on it: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp">Image!</a>.  Maybe it's just Choboyaki...  or Chobomiyaki, except the 'ya' fire kanji immediately follows 'chobo'.  I dunno...</p><div class='title'><b>Off to Geo</b></div><p>That stuff was delicious and unique, but it's off to the game store to kill time.  I'm sure Dave was somewhat bored with my over-attentive scrutiny of searching every single game they owned, so I didn't go through absolutely everything.  I searched PS2 games and found nothing.  I skimmed PS1, skimmed Saturn, searched Dreamcast, and that was pretty much it.  I couldn't quit find the Rhythm game section for PS2, but didn't want to bore Dave that much more.</p><p>Though, on my way out, Beatmania caught my eye.  "Hold on a second.." I said as I crotched down to take a look, and HOLY CRAP!  What do you know!  It just so happened that they had a copy of DDR Party Collection on the shelf.  I was pretty surprised, as I had never seen this game in the wild.  Though, I didn't get my hopes completely up, as in the past, I happened across a game on the shelf, and they ultimated didn't actually have it in stock.</p><p>I took the case to the counter as my only purchase.  They went around the corner to search through their PS2 games, and didn't seem to immediately find it.  The two girls came back to the counter to take a look at the case again and noticed something they had missed on first glance.  They went to the back and came back with this:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp"  /></p><p>Exclamation point!  Not only did they have a copy of the game, they had the limited edition release of the game that came with a dance pad, complete with bucket.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp"  /></p><p>I looked closer at the sales label (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp">pictured here</a>), and it had the sale date as Dec 11th, 2003.  Not only did they have this in their possesion, but it's been since RELEASE DAY!  It had waited for 6 1/2 years collecting dust and being constantly passed up but patrons until I came through the doors.  One of the games I've been searching for 6 years, and I found a release copy NEW.</p><p>This is fate.  I immediately bought it.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a bucket of DDR turned into a slight difficulty considering Dave and I packed VERY lightly for our trip.  I had no room for this thing in my luggage.  But how could I not keep this thing that I was destined to own!</p><p>Well, I don't need the crappy DDR pad.  So, I threw that in the trash.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp"  /></p><p>I stuff the bucket full of my dirty clothes</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp"  /></p><p>And doing so gave me plenty of room to store in my luggage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp"  /></p><p>Perfect!</p><p>And so my quest ends.  The game that took me the longest time to find was finally found.  (Actually, I guess that's not true, as I've been searching for a copy of Snatcher on Sega CD since the late 90s.)  With DDR Party in hand, my PS2 DDR Collection is complete.  I have all the games I want. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Visiting Fukuoka 福岡" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/visiting-fukuoka">Visiting Fukuoka 福岡</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm totally excited, but the day's traveling has worn that down a little bit.  It's not until my batteries are fully recharged that my energy empowers my excitement.  That first morning back in Japan is like Christmas as a Child.</p><p>I want to do everything!  And my first destination was Tokyo Tower, which is its own symbol of regeneration.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp"  /></p><p>After World War II, Japan was a defeated nation.  They were down, but not out.  Everyone in the nation pulled together to rebuild Japan.  Japan flourished once again.</p><p>In 1953, NHK began broadcasting for the first time.  But the signal was too weak for the entire Kanto region to receive its signals.  It was clear that a large transmission tower would be needed to boost the signal, or else moderately sized ones would choke Tokyo.</p><p>They called upon Tachu Naito to architect such a tower.  He chose the France's Eiffel Tower as a starting point, and designed a structure so secure that it could withstand an Earthquake twice the strength of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake (8.3 on the Richter Scale) and typhoons with wind speeds up to 140 miles an hour.</p><p>When completed it stood 30 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower.  It became a symbol for Japan.

my collectibles because I really haven't gotten anything out them.  I bought a whole lot of figures from McFarlane toys, and they've done nothing but sit in my parent's attic for nearly 10 years.  So, I put them on ebay.  Some of them sold quite fast, but others lingered for quite a long time.</p><p>Fast forward to March this year.  I've already purchased airfare for the first couple days in May to visit Tokyo, Japan.  I get an email from an ebay user wondering if I'd ship something of mine to Tokyo.  The light bulb immediately flashes in my head, and I start writing the reply,</p><p>"Yeah, I could ship to Tokyo but it'll be about $30 or $40 extra.  As it so happens, I'll be in Tokyo at the beginning of May.  If you wouldn't mind waiting 2 months, I could deliver the figure in person free of charge. ^_^  What do you say?"</p><p>Initially, the user was taken back by this.  "What?  I don't even know you," his first reply began with.  But once I proved the depths of my Anime nerdom, he agreed to meet.  He introduced himself as Akira. ^_^  I asked him for suggestions of places I should visit while in Japan and he mentioned to Ghibli Museum.  There's a Ghibli Museum?!  Damn straight I'm going there.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning a trip to the Ghibli Museum</b></div><p>Thankfully, Akira mentioned that buying tickets for the Ghibli Museum is not straightforward.  You can't buy the tickets at the Museum.  In Japan, you must buy tickets at a Lawsons convenience store.  The ticket is for a specific day with entrance at a specific time of that day.  For non-Japanese residents, you must buy your tickets through JTB Travel Agency.</p><p>We choose a day, May 3rd, and bought our tickets without a problem.  Our tickets were for 2pm, so we planned to meet up ahead of time.  We could go to Shinjuku or wherever and hang out.  Eventually, we'll make our way down to Mitaka Station and take the bus to the Ghibli Museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Hanging Out before hand</b></div><p>Thank god for my Japanese Cell Phone.  There's no way we would've found each other had he not been able to call me and talk.  We met in near the East entrance of Shinjuku Station.  And we just walked around to various stores and arcades in the area,  chatted about Anime and Games.  What I liked, What he liked.  General bullshit like that.</p><p>We hopped on a train and went over to Nakano to visit the very first Mandarake store.  The Nakano Mandarake was absolutely massive.  It was 3 floors with each floor was about the size of a mall.  This Mandarake was segmented into many different stores that specialized in each tiny niche of otaku fandom.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" /></p><p>There was a store for costumes, one for retro games, one for newer game, one for new games, artbooks, design books, animation cells, figures, statues, gashapon, old music, game music, foreign music, anime, movies, foreign movies...  the list goes on and on.  This is where I found Ikaruga Used for $36.  I also found a few <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp">copies</a> of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3305.webp">Metal Wolf Chaos</a> on Xbox, but they were more than $70 each.</p><p>Nakano Mandarake is also where I found more Super Mario Bros. sound drops.</p><p>As time crept closer to 2pm, we left Mandarake, hopped on a train and headed for Mitaka.  We got to the Museum right on time and met up with Akira's wife, Natsuki, outside. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Museum</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3306.webp" /></p><p>The Ghibli Museum was very rustic and homely. ^_^  Nested snug in a heavily wooded park, the organic domes and vine covered walls made a perfect home.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3317.webp" /></p><p>Unfortunately, taking pictures inside the Museum was not allowed.  But, the museum was very nice.  Each part of the museum was a separate room that you'd enter from the center of the building.  The first room had animated statues of Ghilbi characters that displayed how the animation process works.</p><p>Also on the first floor, was a theater that played an original production only available to see at the Museum.  They have 6 or 7 different original 15-minute films that rotate month after month.  For May, they were playing "Mei to Koneko Bus" (english: "Mei and the Koneko Bus").  Which featured Mei from Totoro who captured a Kitty Bus, and then go off in the woods with it and meets a bunch of Totoros.  It was really cute. ^_^</p><p>After the film, we went on the roof to see the Laputa Garden.  When reaching the roof, you're immediately greeted by a Laputa Giant.  Akira and I stood next to it for a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" /></p><p>The path continued along the back to reveal a Laputa stone.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" /></p><p>There were other spiffy areas in the museum, too.  Like a life-sized Cat Bus for the kids to hop around on.  There was also an area that served as a replica to Miyazaki's workbench from when he began Ghibli films.  All along the walls were original sketches and storyboards for his works throughout the years.</p><p>There was the gift shop too!  I bought a design book that has many storyboards from Ghibli films throughout the years.  I bought some stickers for my suitcase.  And, I bought some other things to give as gifts for people. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Afterwards..</b></div><p>After leaving the Ghibli Museum, we walked through the park towards the Kichijoji train station.  Mitaka is a beatiful area.  Perfect for letting children run around outside in a nice wooded area, rather than the cool concrete of the Tokyo streets.  Before we parted ways, we went to Dinner at a Sushi restaurant underneath Kichijoji station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" /></p><p>This was one of those Sushi restaurant that had a conveyer belt running through the restaurant.  When something came by your table that looked delicious you'd take it from the line and it's yours!  The color and design of the plate designated the price you'd pay for eating it.  Prices ranged from 75 cents a plate to $6.  My favorite sushi were in the $1.50, $2 range, so I was fine. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" /></p><p>They had the best California Rolls I've ever eaten.  The avacado was crisp and cool, next to the tender soft crab meat wrapped around delicious rice topped with some mayonaise and tuna eggs.  (at least, I think those are tuna eggs.)</p><p>Delicious!  But I still prefer 100 yen Sushi in Nagasaki. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Bon Voyage..</b></div><p>Meeting Akira and Natsuki was amazing and definitely the highlight of my trip.  The Language difference wasn't too great.  They were much better at English than I was at Japanese.  But we were able to go back and forth between the 2 to figure out what we were trying to say.  Hopefully, my Japanese will be better next time I'm in Tokyo so we can have better conversations!</p><p>If you buy or sell stuff on ebay, I think it's definitely worth your while to meet up with people if you have the chance.  Whatever you're buying or selling is a great place to start a conversation.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Akihabara isn't that exciting" rel="bookmark"

| May 28, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Though, I'm pretty sure I didn't go to the right places..</p><p>Akihabara was one of the top places on my itinerary for Tokyo.  Worldwide, it is known as THE hub for Anime, Video Games and all things electronic.  Almost every store sold new and used video games, music, movies, anime, electronics, toys, and just about anything geeks like us would buy.  You'd think it'd be heaven, right?</p><p>Yeah, it's great if you're trying to find something relatively new.  But searching for rare or uncommon video games is pointless.  I visited about 30 game stores along Chuodori and in the alleyways around there and each store had the same problem..  Overexposure.</p><p>So many goddamn people visit Akihabara that any amount of selection had already been picked over by thousands of people that day.  Every store I visited had wall-to-wall people.  I could hardly even more through the aisles, let alone, stay in one place long enough to actually give an exhaustive search.</p><p>Also, because of the centralized location and massive worldwide acclaim of the area, real estate is tight.  Every store is smaller than your average Mall Gamestop and holds about 3 times the product.  Most stores do have multiple floors though, but they generally keep games to one floor, Anime to another floor, and buy counters to another.</p><p class='img'><b>Yodobashi</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3349.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3349.webp" /></p><p>My first location was Akihabara's Yodobashi Camera.  Yodobashi is THE premiere electronic department store in Japan.  I can't really think of a good analogy..  It's kinda like the FAO Shwartz of electronics?  Except not snobby.  Their Gashapon Aisles were impressive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3346.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3346.webp" /></p><p>I bought a couple toys for Jess Roqs, but that's about it.  The toy section was kinda boring and expensive.  So was their game section.  Their game section did have a neat little diorama for Gyakuten Kenji, which was released TODAY in Japan.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3348.webp" /></p><p>Ultimately, I left this massive building unsatisfied...</p><p class='img'><b>Gamers</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3362.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3362.webp" /></p><p>Exiting Akiba station and heading west to Chuodori, the first major store you see is Gamers (pictured above from across the street.)  As I stood cramped in a boring corner of Gamers waiting for someone to move so I could stop looking at the N64 games, I said to myself, "ya know, if there were an earthquake, not a single person in this building would exit alive."  Maybe it's not so cramped for Japanese people.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3353.webp" /></p><p>It was pretty cramped for Japanese girls dressed up in gigantic mascot uniforms, though.  She had to shove her way through everyone just to get to the back of the store.</p><p>Games did have a poster for Evangelion 2.0 in one of its stairwells.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3351.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3351.webp" /></p><p>Besides that, I didn't find anything great inside of Gamers.  Well... I suppose I did find a first print copy of Riz-Zoawd on DS that was packaged with the OST.  Riz-Zoawd is a Japanese RPG based on The Wizard of Oz that uses the Stylus in some weird way.  It's developed by Media Creations (creators of Wild Arms). It looked really interesting.  But I figured that I'd never play it, so I passed.</p><p class='img'><b>Wandering Around</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3366.webp" /></p><p>Like I mentioned before, Akihabara was fricken packed.  The day I visited was Greenery Day (a national holiday), so that may have been another reason for the crowds.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3355.webp" /></p><p>Isn't selling the R4 card illegal in Japan?  Note that the sign states that the R4 card does not work with the recently released DSi.  Only works for DS Lite.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3361.webp" /></p><p>One of the buildings had some girls singing a concert.  It was just a bunch of J-Poppy songs, so I didn't stick around for very long.</p><p class='img'><b>Super Potato</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3376.webp" /></p><p>When talking about Japanese retro games, Jeremy Parish, Chris Kohler, and other <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/my1up?publicUserId=5655917" title="http://www.1up.com/do/my1up?publicUserId=5655917">retronauts</a> always seem to mention their favorite Japanese game store: Super Potato.  So, I made a point to find this place and take a gander.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090504_japan/IMG_3375.webp" /></p><p>Super Potato has 3 floors to its own.  All the merchandise is crammed into floors 3 and 4.  Translating: The 3rd floor has Famicon, Megadrive, Super Famicon, 3DO, PC Engine, Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, and NeoGeo games.  The 4th floor has Playstation, Gameboy, Nintendo 64, Gamecube, Xbox, Game Watch, Game Music, LSI?

Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete</b> 1st Edition<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3667.webp" /></p><p>Though, Advent Children Complete really isn't a game.  The 1st Edition release contained the demo for Final Fantasy XIII on PS3.  I decided to buy it because Square has no plans to release a disc version of the demo in North America.  And the Advent Children Complete film is entirely in english.  Or, at least, subtitled.</p><p>I figured the "1st Edition" might be difficult to come by since it's a first edition.  But, Square saw fit to produce nearly 2 million first editions of this set, so this product was everywhere.  Every store I went to had copies of Advent Children Complete.  Most used stores even had it.  In fact, Yamada Lavi in Shibuya, which is where I bought it, actually had their copies discounted to around $52.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - English of the Dead</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3664.webp" /></p><p>While browsing game stores in Shinjuku, I came across English of the Dead for the DS at a Softmap.  I was instantly entranced by the sheer concept and the throwback to Typing of the Dead for Dreamcast.  It's basically the same game!  Instead of typing out words to kill zombies, you translate Kanji into English.  What a perfect vehicle to learn more Kanji!  Instant Purchase.</p><p class='img'><b>DS - Doki Doki Majo Shinpan! 2</b><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090506_games/IMG_3666.webp" /></p><p>I found this game at a Trader located in Akihabara for a mere $20!  For those who don't know, the Doki Doki Majo Shinpan is a dating sim sort of game where you must determine whether or not underaged school girls are witches.  In order to make that determination you must touch and grope these girls with the DS Stylus.  Take a look at this video for a demonstration: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phSZ_rNhDsw</a></p><p>The first Doki Doki Majo Shinpan was release in 2007 and prompted much internet humor.  In 2008, SNK released this follow-up that was rated even higher on their Adult-content scale.</p><p>Anyways, $20 is pretty cheap for one of the more bizarre Japanese DS releases.</p><p class='img'><b>DS -

until the night before to do everything.  On Wednesday Night, I bought better insoles for my shoes, packed clothing, packed other stuff, paid rent, processed all my old photos still on my camera, watched Rescue Me.  I could have easily done this stuff on Tuesday, but decided to wait for I don't know why.</p><p>As such I got to bed around Midnight.  I wanted to get a good night's rest before my 8am flight, but It was not in the cards.  I had to wake up around 5:15am and get outside to catch a bus at 5:52 to head to the airport.  A transfer here, a transfer there, and I was at the airport.  A timely arrival didn't really matter though, since Chicago thunderstorms delayed my flight out of Madison about 2 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>O'hare</b></div><p>Eventually, I made it to Chicago with well enough time to catch my Narita flight.  So much time, in fact, that I walked around the airport.</p><p class='img'><img

what I see of O'hare is construction, or concrete walls.  The International flight areas is really pretty.  The corridor connecting Terminals B and C is underground and has rainbow lights that flicker along to classical music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090501_japan/IMG_3111.webp" loading="lazy"

time.  I boarded the plane, sat in my seat, and off we went to Narita.  I choose the very last window seat on the left side of the plane: 61B.  Which was great in theory.  There was no one behind me to kick my seat!  However, directly behind me was a semi-open area for people to stand and stretch.  So I only slept a couple times, and 20 minutes at time for that matter.</p><p>The pilot was pretty efficient.  We got to Narita 20 minutes ahead of schedule!  However, that didn't make any difference.</p><div class='title'><b>Narita</b></div><p>The Japanese Health Administration was set into Panic mode thanks to the Swine Flu and EVERY incoming human to Japan had to be "Quarantined".  We sat on the plane for an additional 2 hours after our 12 hour flight for Health officials to board the plane and have us take an additional customs survey about our health.</p><p>One-by-one passenger-by-passenger they would receive our survey process it and then decide that we're OK.</p><p class='img'><img

ridiculousness.  Everyone sat in their seat and waited.  I was probably the only one on the plane that didn't have a connecting flight, too.  We arrived at Narita around 2:20pm and I finally got off the plane around 4:15pm.  It's been about 21 hours since I've got any actual sleep.</p><div class='title'><b>Shibuya</b></div><p>The Narita Express took me directly to Shibuya where I plan on staying for my whole trip.  The second that I got off the train I started walking in the direction I thought was correct but was not.  I joked that I was totally get lost walking around Tokyo, but I didn't think I would get lost so early in my Journey.  Once I found a city map, I was turned toward the right direction.</p><p>The Hotel I planned on staying at was actually a Love Hotel.  I guess that's what I get for last minute research.  There was an actual hotel right around the corner though.  So I checked in, got in my room and finally went to sleep around 7:30pm (24 hours since I woke up at 5:15am in Madison).<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/12">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/travel/10">Next
