There are only 4 colors, too, so that's also a problem.  But, as long as I'm able to prop the camera up against the glass or some solid surface, it's stable enough to take a photo without blur. Above is a stitched together image from 4 shots.</p><p>Mt. Ontake and Mt. Norikura to the north were clearly visible, too. It's pretty amazing how far you're able to see when the weather is so clear.  Mt. Norikura is the eastern-most mountain in Takayama that borders Nagano. Takayama is about 80km north from the Twin Arch, and Norikura is about 50km directly east from there.</p><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="columnTwo"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Mt. Ontake is the one bigger one on the right.  Mt. Norikura is on the left. It's pretty amazing that the GB Camera can get so much detail out of something that is over 60km away.</p><p>The Twin Arch is really the only landmark around the area, so you have an impressive view of suburbs after suburbs after suburbs. The view is amazing, especially on such a great day, but there isn't really a whole lot to see. There's the ferris wheel to the north next to the aquarium, but that's really the closest thing. Both Nagoya and Gifu City are so far away, you can't really get any detail other than the skyline.</p><p>I wanted to get some more detailed shots with both my regular camera and my GameBoy camera, so I shot a massive panoramic photo of the north with some detailed GB shots.</p><p>Can you find the <b>three</b> locations of the GB shots in the panoramic?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205052.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205052.webp" /></div><div class="column"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205107.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205107.webp" /></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205115.webp" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I love this GameBoy Camera so much. I'm using the GameBoy Camera Plus mod created by 2BitToy, which takes the inner circuits from a GameBoy Camera and puts them into a new shell with a CS Mount lens adapter. This allows you to use far more powerful lenses than the original. You can read about it here: <a href="/old/v7/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens" title="/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens">/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens</a> (April 13th, 2023). I'm using my Analogue Pocket to run it.</p><p>Also in the observation deck is a small cafe. Its signature dish was called Honey Toast. As you can see from the photo below, it is a slice of very sweet toast topped with vanilla ice cream and whip cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup surrounded by almonds and sliced strawberries. It was an excellent breakfast.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>I think it'd be great to visit in other seasons to see how everything changes.

Despite traveling through the area numerous times throughout the last 10 years, I've never noticed this structure perched on the hill.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5073_t.webp"/></a></p><p>After parking at the Sarukura Forest Park alongside several barbecue bits, you are presented with 440 steps that ascend to an altitude of 345 meters. It takes about 10 minutes, which isn't so bad unless you aren't prepared for it. As you reach the top, you'll find the wind castle, pictured above.</p><p>This is the summit of Sarukura Mountain <span class='ja'>猿倉山</span>, and from the observation deck, you can see all the way to Toyama Bay on a clear day.</p><p>I took a bunch of photos and put them together into a huge panoramic shot.</p><p class='img'><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vjU_v7KZ6PzFwT7WJH_ybOiF-fDR_IWq/view"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/wind_castle_panoramic_hi_t.webp" /><br/>Hi-Res Panoramic: /wind_castle_panoramic_hi.png (186.5mb)</a></p></p><p>You can see nearly all of Toyama, and there is a free-to-use binocular scope so you see the airport, sports arena, and other areas in clear view.</p><p>Apparently, around 1558 to 1570, the summit of Sarukura Mountain was the site of the Sarukura Castle <span class='ja'>猿倉城</span>, but nothing remains today. The military commander at the time was under the command of the ruler of the Hida region to the south. Hida is surrounded by mountains, so there are very few ways of getting up there. This castle was built to monitor any large armies that may be headed up the mountain to attack.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5012_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>This path can be clearly seen today in the above panoramic. There's an incredible clear view of Hwy 41 coming down from Hida. </p><p>It still completely baffles me that I never noticed this place before. Although, I think it's easy to see why I hadn't noticed it before. On my way back home up to Hida, I took some reverse photos looking back at the mountain and the castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The white castle blends into the sky very easily. If you didn't know it was there, you would never notice it. But, once you know that it's there and where to look, it pops out.</p><p>There's also not a whole lot of information about the Wind Castle online. In fact, my friend and I only found this thing by skimming around Toyama in Google Maps looking for something to do. I wanted to know exactly when they built this thing, and its purpose. </p><p>There's a plaque on the Wind Caste which states the following: <br/><b><span class='ja'>平成</span>2<span class='ja'>年度</span></b> <I>Heisei-2 (or 1990)</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>中部通商産業局</span> <span class='ja'>地域エネルギー開発利用発電モデル事業</span></b> <I>Chubu Bureau of International Trade and Industry Regional Energy Development Utilization Power Generation Model Project</I><br/><b><span class='ja'>「風の城</span> <span class='ja'>風力エネルギー開発利用事業」</span></b><I>"The Wind Castle - Wind Energy Development Utilization Project"</I><br/><b>-<span class='ja'>富山県大沢野町</span></b> <I>- Osawano Town, Toyama Prefecture.</I></p><p>Quite a mouthful. Seems like it was built in 1990, although I wanted to find more substantial information online. Eventually I did find a blog post of someone talking about Sarukura castle (explained earlier), and a few other things. In particular, in 1975, as part of Toyama prefecture's 100th year anniversary, a 9.6km trail was opened from Mt. Sarukura to Mt. Kosami Gozen <span class='ja'>小佐波御前山</span>. It didn't mention anything about the Wind Castle at that time. </p><p>I didn't find anything that confirmed its opening in 1990. But, it was probably built in 1990 as its architecture and flashy nature seems to fit that time well. Like everything built during the economic high times of the 80s and 90s in Japan, it is definitely showing wear and tear from the years. Some of the windows have been kicked out, and the metal railing has graffiti almost everywhere. One of the door had been kicked in, too.</p><p>If you've never been, I would absolutely recommend driving up here if you're going to or from Toyama. I will probably return here each time I visit Toyama now. Different weather, different season, and different time of day will all create a new view. :)<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/nishi-cho-taiki">Nishi-cho Taiki 西町大喜</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I've been out of the ramen game a little while, and also Takayama's ramen has very thin noodles and thin broth. The standard size is pretty much the perfect amount of ramen.  Yet, they also offered sizes that were 1.5 times and double the standard.  I don't know how anyone could eat those.</p><p>With all the onions and pepper, the ramen had a somewhat hidden, gradually building, and lingering spiciness to it, which was very unique. I always consume everything I order, so I always eat/drink the broth, which is not the Japanese norm. The broth was very dark with the amount of soy-sauce infused in it. Ramen isn't the most healthy food to begin with, but with the amount of soy-sauce included, I would not recommend eating/drinking all of it, like I had. With the amount of onions and pepper in there, too, I needed a lot more water than what they provided.</p><p>Overall, I thought it was pretty good, but I'm not a fan of Black Ramen.

| April 15, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Japan is a country rich in history, and a country that is rich in history is also rich in museums. There are many national and prefectural museums that focus on the history of Japan both for culture and art. However, almost all of these museums focus on periods of Japan up through the Meiji era (through 1912) and World War II. Very few focus on the development of Japan after.</p><p>To pick up the slack, there are many independent <b>Retro</b> museums that can be found in small towns and resort towns. Owners of these museums curate their personal collections of 50-60 year old technology and memorabilia. Most of these gathered from friends or business upgrading their old stuff.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp"></a></p><p>The <b>Gifu Retro Museum</b> is a little different than other retro museum I've been to before. It does curate stuff from the past, but it would be more accurate to call this a Retro Amusement Center. The entry fee is timed, rather than a flat fee.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><u>Adults to Junior High students</u><br/>One hour is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 3000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column"><u> Elementary school students </u><br/>One hour is 500<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 1300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><u>Children ages 4 to 6 years old</u><br/>One hour is 300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 800<span class='ja'>円</span></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The "museum" is divided into three distinct separate rooms, each with their own distinctive feel and purpose. I'm sure that the entry pass is required for all three areas. The three rooms are the main room in the middle, which has snacks and arcade machines, the pachinko room on the right, and the food lounge to the left. </p><div class='title'><b>Main Room</b></div><p>When you enter the middle room, there are old posters and knick knacks pinned to the wall and sitting on old arcade machines and soda machines. When you exit the immediate entrance area, you exit an old style candy shop with lots of sweets and candy for sale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>A few arcade games and several amusement games are fit against the walls where there is space. There is a wack-a-mole game and racing game that probably distributed tickets back in the day. There's a flag game, where the characters tell you to raise or lower flags. There's also a Janken game where you deposit some amount of coin medals. If you win, a roulette will spin and its possible to get 20 times your coins back.</p><p>For Arcade machines, they had an After Burner and Super Hang-on machine. They had a Neo Geo switcher with a few games installed. A cocktail Nintendo VS cabinet, with Super Mario Bros, Mario Bros, and a few others. They had a cabinet with Darkstalkers currently installed. (Curious if they had any other CPS2 games in the back.)</p><p>With the entry paid for time, all arcade games were set to Free Play. So, you could do whatever you like. I played the Flag game for a little bit, trying to quickly understand the Japanese, and I played the Janken game too. The Janken game would be a really fun programming project if I get the chance to learn FPGA programming.</p><div class='title'><b>Pachinko Room</b></div><p>The Main Room leads into the Pachinko room, which is also accessible from the outside. This seems to be the main draw for people to come here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp"/></a></p><p>The Pachinko room has two rows full of machines from the late 80s and early 90s. They probably rescued this from an old Pachinko parlor that was getting demolished. All machines work and already had a few people on them right as the museum opened in the morning.</p><p>I wasn't exactly sure how the room was supposed to work. In a real pachinko parlor, you buy your balls and go to town on a machine. But, I wasn't sure if you still bought balls even after paying the entry fee, or if you could just grab a tray and mess around? Bleh, I really should've asked, but I was already self-conscious enough with the clerks constantly watching me take photos.</p><p>This seems like a pretty good activity for the elderly people living in the town. Rather than have them blow tons of money at a real pachinko parlor, they could pay $30 to sit in here all day. They could play the pachinko games they may have played years ago, and try to beat each other's high scores.

| April 4, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>From March 21st through June 11th, the National Craft Museum in Kanazawa, Ishikawa is hosting an exhibit entitled, Pokemon x Kouge. Kouge <span class='ja'>工芸</span> is Japanese for crafts, such as pottery, woodworking, and any other profession that designs and creates materials and works. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" /></a></p><p>20 Japanese artisans and craftsmen, from young to old, were challenged with how they could incorporate Pokemon into their works. How could they make something that could display the essence of a Pokemon, whether it be through their appearance, gestures, or traces of gameplay through trading, evolving, or battling? How would a particular Pokemon's personality or history clash or match with traditional crafts? With these questions and ideas, they have created over 70 original works displayed in this exhibit.</p><p>Here's the website: <a href="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/" title="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/">https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/</a></p><p>Also, here's the exhibit brochure:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing"> https://drive.google.com/.../15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK</a></p><p>A friend sent me a link to this exhibit. I had seen a link about it before, but I didn't realize it was in Kanazawa. So close! I thought it was in Tokyo, or Osaka, or something. So, I went there on Thursday March 30th and arrived around 11:30am. There was a line to enter, but I only had to wait 20 minutes. Not too bad for a Thursday. They had reservation tickets available, which would probably be necessary on weekends. Individual tickets were 900<span class='ja'>円</span>. You can buy tickets online, too.</p><p>The exhibit was divided into three sections: Appearance, Stories, and Life. All of my photos are included at the bottom.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>すがたーせまる</span>！ Appearance - Approach!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first room were works inspired by the appearance of the Pokemon. How does a Pokemon's appearance inspire these craftsmen to use their mastery to develop artwork that evokes both the spirit of the Pokemon and a demonstration of the mastery of their craft. This section featured artwork from Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> and Mitsuta Haruo <span class='ja'>満田晴穂</span> (both Metal Works), Fukuda Toru <span class='ja'>福田亭</span> (Wood Works), and Imai Sadamasa <span class='ja'>今井完眞</span> and Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span> (Ceramics).</p><p>My favorite pieces from this section was the Jolteon by Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> (pictured above), and the vase and bowl entitled "Vase with Pokemon of the Universe" <span class='ja'>森羅万像ポケモン壷</span> and "Beautiful Bowl with the Super-Ancient of Pokemon" <span class='ja'>超古代ポケモン玉盌</span>. Both were created by Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span>. (pictured below)</p><p>The Pokemon vase was interesting because you could stare at it for hours searching for various Pokemon and continue to find new ones you hadn't before. Also, I love how the Hoenn legendary pokemon are depicted in the Beautiful Bowl, clashing the power of fire, water, and wind.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>ものがたりー浸る</span>！ Stories - Jump in!</b></div><p>The second room features works inspired by the aspects of the Pokemon adventure, such as catching, battling, and evolving. While collecting Pokemon themselves is very much core to the series, the journey of the starting off at the beginning and slowly growing and strengthening your Pokemon and yourself as you become the strongest trainer in the land is equally inspiring. Works in this section were created by Tanaka Nobuyuki <span class='ja'>田中信行</span> and Ikeda Terumasa <span class='ja'>池田晃将</span> (Lacquerware), Niimi Hiroki <span class='ja'>新實広記</span>and Ikemoto Kazumi <span class='ja'>池本一三</span> (Glass Works), Hayashi Shigeki <span class='ja'>林茂樹</span> (Ceramics), Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span> (Metal Works), and Shiromi Eiichi <span class='ja'>城間栄市</span> and Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> (Textiles).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Hayashi Shigeki's Robot (Moonlight) greeted everyone when the reached the top of the stairs. All of the vases were really goofy, and the yukatas were pretty. The Yukatas, created by Shiromi Eiichi, were made using a Bingata pattern-style, traditional to Okinawa. These have repeated patterns of nature using primary colors of red, blue, yellow, green, and pink. The Alola starters, Pikachu, Raichu, and Oricorio fit both the pattern of colors, and island theme.</p><p>I think the biggest standouts to me were the transformable Rookidee figures which "evolve" into Corviknight, by Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span>. Obviously the size is off, but the proportions of both Pokemon are perfect, and coming up with a design to allow them to transform into each other is fascinating. The Pikachu forest, created by Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> was definitely the center piece of the room.

How can the flame of the Pokemon match the fires of the kiln when baking jars? How can the spirit and energy of Pokemon enlighten kimono and ornaments used in festivals? Craftsmen from this section include Katsura Morihito <span class='ja'>桂盛仁</span> (Metal Works), Taguchi Yoshiaki <span class='ja'>田口義明</span> (Lacquerware), Kuwata Takuro <span class='ja'>桑田卓郎</span>, Ueba Kasumi <span class='ja'>植葉香澄</span>, and Masumoto Keiko <span class='ja'>桝本佳子</span> (Ceramics), and Mizuhashi Saori <span class='ja'>水橋さおり</span> and Komiya Yasuyoshi <span class='ja'>小宮康義</span> (Textiles).</p><p>The most notable pieces in the room were the pottery created by Masumoto Keiko. The Charizard and Charmander pots made sense being fire Pokemon. The Ninetales pot was especially interesting as the inside of the pot was brown and burnt like the Kantonian form, but the outside was glazed white, like the Alolan form. I liked her Moltres piece the most. Moltres appears by breaking out of an egg with flames. I think the other standouts in the room where all of the figures created by Ueba Kasumi, especially the Shaymin figure. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Kogei Catalogue</b></div><p>The best thing about every museum and museum exhibit in Japan is that the gift shop sells a book detailing each piece on display.

| March 30, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Along the Shou river and within the various Gasshou-style villages in southern Toyama prefecture, there is a restaurant that stands alone on the side of the road with a bear of its sign. Underneath, there's another sign that says <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>, or <I>Kuma-don</I>, or a Bear Bowl, which would be a bowl of rice with bear meat. Nearly 6 years ago, I saw this sign as teachers and I were going exploring on our way to Kanazawa. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is <b>Takachiyo</b>, a restaurant that serves dishes made from the meat of local wildlife.</p><p>While the sign is very noticeable, its location is very out-of-the-way. It's about halfway between Takayama and Toyama along the highway, but it's about 10 minutes away from the highway exit. Most people from Takayama don't take the highway when going to Toyama because Route 41 has no tolls and takes the same amount of time. Route 41 goes a completely different direction through the mountains, so it never connects to the highway.</p><p>Here's the location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9" title="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9">https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9</a></p><p>Today, I went to Kanazawa, so on my return trip, I finally had the opportunity to visit the restaurant again.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides bear meat, the hunter that owns the restaurant, also traps deer and boar from the surrounding mountains. All of his dishes are prepared using local ingredients, including mountain vegetables, rice, and noodles. Soba noodles are hand-made from buckwheat grown by local people. </p><p>The menu mentions that killing animals for money is evil. However, we all live by consuming plants and animals. We must give thanks to them before each meal (and live together with them, in nature). This is the basic explanation of "Ittedakimasu," which is the 'grace' we all say before we eat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Five years ago, on my first visit to Takachiyo, I ordered their signature dish, the <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>. The bear meat was alright. It was tough and had a full taste, like beef. But, it also had a stringy-ness to it. Added with onions, eggs, and served on rice, it tasted delicious. </p><p>I went with some friends, and they ordered other dishes. One of my friends got some deer nabe. Nabe is a bit bowl of boiling broth with lots of vegetables and meat. It's similar to stew, but stew's main base is meat. Nabe's main base are the vegetables. Nabe is very weak in comparison. </p><p>The deer meat was alright. Japanese wild animals are much smaller compared with their American counterparts. They don't have gigantic bodies or gigantic muscles. As such, it didn't taste like venison I've had in the past. Again, more stringy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For my meal today, I ordered a Boar Bowl and Boar Udon. Boar was the one animal I hadn't tried last time, so I wanted to complete the triangle. The boar meat in both dishes was rough, like a flank steak. The meat itself had a dry texture, even though it was submerged in the Udon broth.</p><p>Overall, I would say that if you planned on going here to try exotic meats, you may leave disappointed. However, you would not be disappointed with the actual meals. While the meats themselves were just okay, the rice bowls and udon tasted excellent. Very good. Just good enough that I would recommend going out of the way to try and visit at least once.</p><p>There are plenty more things available on the menu than what I've ordered so far. He had English menus available to take, so I scanned it. Also, I still had a Japanese menu from the first time I visited.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Wajima Wave Barricades" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/wajima-wave-barricades">Wajima Wave Barricades</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In these festivals, Mikoshi from shrines are carried through the town, like most festivals. Along with Mikoshi, Kiriko <span class='ja'>キリコ</span> Latterns are also carried. These are near two-or-three-story high wooden latterns celebrating the gods and spirits of neighborhoods and communities around the Noto Pennisula.</p><p>The Wajima Kiriko Art Museum celebrates and displays many Kiriko Latterns, and teaches its visitors about the history of the festival, the traditions, and the latterns. The museum attempts to recreate the liveliness of the festival with music playing in the background, and the lights dying down for night. The latterns are all light up to show their brilliance. This loops every 30 minutes, or so. A few times a day, there are also some live performers show off the dances.</p><p>It reminds me a lot of the Takayama Festival Museum, which also showcases the various performances of festival, and runs on a 30-minute loop.</p><p>While this museum just opened in 2015, it is currently closed having suffered damage from the January 1st 2024 Noto Earthquake.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/3">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/travel">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
