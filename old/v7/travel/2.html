| April 4, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>From March 21st through June 11th, the National Craft Museum in Kanazawa, Ishikawa is hosting an exhibit entitled, Pokemon x Kouge. Kouge <span class='ja'>工芸</span> is Japanese for crafts, such as pottery, woodworking, and any other profession that designs and creates materials and works. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" /></a></p><p>20 Japanese artisans and craftsmen, from young to old, were challenged with how they could incorporate Pokemon into their works. How could they make something that could display the essence of a Pokemon, whether it be through their appearance, gestures, or traces of gameplay through trading, evolving, or battling? How would a particular Pokemon's personality or history clash or match with traditional crafts? With these questions and ideas, they have created over 70 original works displayed in this exhibit.</p><p>Here's the website: <a href="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/" title="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/">https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/</a></p><p>Also, here's the exhibit brochure:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing"> https://drive.google.com/.../15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK</a></p><p>A friend sent me a link to this exhibit. I had seen a link about it before, but I didn't realize it was in Kanazawa. So close! I thought it was in Tokyo, or Osaka, or something. So, I went there on Thursday March 30th and arrived around 11:30am. There was a line to enter, but I only had to wait 20 minutes. Not too bad for a Thursday. They had reservation tickets available, which would probably be necessary on weekends. Individual tickets were 900<span class='ja'>円</span>. You can buy tickets online, too.</p><p>The exhibit was divided into three sections: Appearance, Stories, and Life. All of my photos are included at the bottom.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>すがたーせまる</span>！ Appearance - Approach!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first room were works inspired by the appearance of the Pokemon. How does a Pokemon's appearance inspire these craftsmen to use their mastery to develop artwork that evokes both the spirit of the Pokemon and a demonstration of the mastery of their craft. This section featured artwork from Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> and Mitsuta Haruo <span class='ja'>満田晴穂</span> (both Metal Works), Fukuda Toru <span class='ja'>福田亭</span> (Wood Works), and Imai Sadamasa <span class='ja'>今井完眞</span> and Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span> (Ceramics).</p><p>My favorite pieces from this section was the Jolteon by Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> (pictured above), and the vase and bowl entitled "Vase with Pokemon of the Universe" <span class='ja'>森羅万像ポケモン壷</span> and "Beautiful Bowl with the Super-Ancient of Pokemon" <span class='ja'>超古代ポケモン玉盌</span>. Both were created by Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span>. (pictured below)</p><p>The Pokemon vase was interesting because you could stare at it for hours searching for various Pokemon and continue to find new ones you hadn't before. Also, I love how the Hoenn legendary pokemon are depicted in the Beautiful Bowl, clashing the power of fire, water, and wind.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>ものがたりー浸る</span>！ Stories - Jump in!</b></div><p>The second room features works inspired by the aspects of the Pokemon adventure, such as catching, battling, and evolving. While collecting Pokemon themselves is very much core to the series, the journey of the starting off at the beginning and slowly growing and strengthening your Pokemon and yourself as you become the strongest trainer in the land is equally inspiring. Works in this section were created by Tanaka Nobuyuki <span class='ja'>田中信行</span> and Ikeda Terumasa <span class='ja'>池田晃将</span> (Lacquerware), Niimi Hiroki <span class='ja'>新實広記</span>and Ikemoto Kazumi <span class='ja'>池本一三</span> (Glass Works), Hayashi Shigeki <span class='ja'>林茂樹</span> (Ceramics), Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span> (Metal Works), and Shiromi Eiichi <span class='ja'>城間栄市</span> and Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> (Textiles).</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1050_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Hayashi Shigeki's Robot (Moonlight) greeted everyone when the reached the top of the stairs. All of the vases were really goofy, and the yukatas were pretty. The Yukatas, created by Shiromi Eiichi, were made using a Bingata pattern-style, traditional to Okinawa. These have repeated patterns of nature using primary colors of red, blue, yellow, green, and pink. The Alola starters, Pikachu, Raichu, and Oricorio fit both the pattern of colors, and island theme.</p><p>I think the biggest standouts to me were the transformable Rookidee figures which "evolve" into Corviknight, by Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span>. Obviously the size is off, but the proportions of both Pokemon are perfect, and coming up with a design to allow them to transform into each other is fascinating. The Pikachu forest, created by Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> was definitely the center piece of the room. (both pictured below)</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1075.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1075_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1075_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1075_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1082.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1082.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1082_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1082_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1082_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1131_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1131_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1131_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1131_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1131_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>くらしー愛でる</span>！Life - Cherish</b></div><p>The final room of the exhibit showcased works that incorporated Pokemon into the artists' medium. How can the flame of the Pokemon match the fires of the kiln when baking jars? How can the spirit and energy of Pokemon enlighten kimono and ornaments used in festivals? Craftsmen from this section include Katsura Morihito <span class='ja'>桂盛仁</span> (Metal Works), Taguchi Yoshiaki <span class='ja'>田口義明</span> (Lacquerware), Kuwata Takuro <span class='ja'>桑田卓郎</span>, Ueba Kasumi <span class='ja'>植葉香澄</span>, and Masumoto Keiko <span class='ja'>桝本佳子</span> (Ceramics), and Mizuhashi Saori <span class='ja'>水橋さおり</span> and Komiya Yasuyoshi <span class='ja'>小宮康義</span> (Textiles).</p><p>The most notable pieces in the room were the pottery created by Masumoto Keiko. The Charizard and Charmander pots made sense being fire Pokemon. The Ninetales pot was especially interesting as the inside of the pot was brown and burnt like the Kantonian form, but the outside was glazed white, like the Alolan form. I liked her Moltres piece the most. Moltres appears by breaking out of an egg with flames. I think the other standouts in the room where all of the figures created by Ueba Kasumi, especially the Shaymin figure. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Kogei Catalogue</b></div><p>The best thing about every museum and museum exhibit in Japan is that the gift shop sells a book detailing each piece on display.

Underneath, there's another sign that says <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>, or <I>Kuma-don</I>, or a Bear Bowl, which would be a bowl of rice with bear meat. Nearly 6 years ago, I saw this sign as teachers and I were going exploring on our way to Kanazawa. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is <b>Takachiyo</b>, a restaurant that serves dishes made from the meat of local wildlife.</p><p>While the sign is very noticeable, its location is very out-of-the-way. It's about halfway between Takayama and Toyama along the highway, but it's about 10 minutes away from the highway exit. Most people from Takayama don't take the highway when going to Toyama because Route 41 has no tolls and takes the same amount of time. Route 41 goes a completely different direction through the mountains, so it never connects to the highway.</p><p>Here's the location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9" title="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9">https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9</a></p><p>Today, I went to Kanazawa, so on my return trip, I finally had the opportunity to visit the restaurant again.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides bear meat, the hunter that owns the restaurant, also traps deer and boar from the surrounding mountains. All of his dishes are prepared using local ingredients, including mountain vegetables, rice, and noodles. Soba noodles are hand-made from buckwheat grown by local people. </p><p>The menu mentions that killing animals for money is evil. However, we all live by consuming plants and animals. We must give thanks to them before each meal (and live together with them, in nature). This is the basic explanation of "Ittedakimasu," which is the 'grace' we all say before we eat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Five years ago, on my first visit to Takachiyo, I ordered their signature dish, the <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>. The bear meat was alright. It was tough and had a full taste, like beef. But, it also had a stringy-ness to it. Added with onions, eggs, and served on rice, it tasted delicious. </p><p>I went with some friends, and they ordered other dishes. One of my friends got some deer nabe. Nabe is a bit bowl of boiling broth with lots of vegetables and meat. It's similar to stew, but stew's main base is meat. Nabe's main base are the vegetables. Nabe is very weak in comparison. </p><p>The deer meat was alright. Japanese wild animals are much smaller compared with their American counterparts. They don't have gigantic bodies or gigantic muscles. As such, it didn't taste like venison I've had in the past. Again, more stringy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For my meal today, I ordered a Boar Bowl and Boar Udon. Boar was the one animal I hadn't tried last time, so I wanted to complete the triangle. The boar meat in both dishes was rough, like a flank steak. The meat itself had a dry texture, even though it was submerged in the Udon broth.</p><p>Overall, I would say that if you planned on going here to try exotic meats, you may leave disappointed. However, you would not be disappointed with the actual meals. While the meats themselves were just okay, the rice bowls and udon tasted excellent. Very good. Just good enough that I would recommend going out of the way to try and visit at least once.</p><p>There are plenty more things available on the menu than what I've ordered so far. He had English menus available to take, so I scanned it. Also, I still had a Japanese menu from the first time I visited.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Other Locations in Taiji 太地町" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/other-locations-in-taiji">Other Locations in Taiji 太地町</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

In 2011, when my brother and I came to Japan, we did sight-seeing around the Kansai region of Japan.  I looked into the logistics of being able to visit Taiji, but it was just too far out of the way, and quite expensive by train.  Driving was really the only sensible option.</p><p>Now that I live in Japan, and drive in Japan, I finally took the opportunity to go there.  Taiji is located on the southern end of the Kii peninsula, so the most sensible route will always enter the town from the north.  That's where I found that dolphin bridge from <a href="/old/v7/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama" title="/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama">the previous post</a>.  On the hill past the dolphin bridge are two large whale statues welcoming you to town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing along, the road curves around the coastline.  There's a shabby-looking, rundown hotel just before the road straightens out, and shoots straight forward to the whale museum and other attractions.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" /></a></p><p>The road is lined with palm trees, and a cement barricade blocking the crashing waves onto the land.  Some townspeople sat along the ends of the piers and cement walls trying to catch some fish.</p><p>At the end of the straight road was the Kyo Maru No. 1, a research and whaling vessel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" /></a></p><p>Nearby were large clamps.  After the "research" vessel fires enough harpoons into the whale to tire it down, and keep it from fighting, the metal contraption clamps into the whale's tail, and hauls it back from the ocean to land for their meat.</p><p>From here, I started roaming around town a little bit to figure out some locations.  I went passed the whaling museum, and saw the cove.  I continued on and went to the downtown area, found the city hall, and took photos overlooking the area.  I went back to the cove, and took those photos.  Then hiked up the northern surrounding mountain, which gave a nice view of the area.  Though, the cove was not visible.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_thecove/IMG_5902_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After that, I spent some time at the Whale Museum, and then began to explore the southern area of the town.  There are several points along the coastline which housed ancient (and some modern) light houses.  Light house keepers had to stay in the light houses several days to make sure the fire continued to burn and illuminate the coastline, so each lighthouse had a small house or a dorm for the keeper.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6307_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6328_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The old wooden light houses were no longer there, but some locations still had the dorms.  One site had a modern light house in place of the old one.  This was the same site that had buildings for butchering and storing whale meat back in the day.  Hundreds of years ago, after a whale was defeated and dragged ashore, it sometimes took weeks to cut through the entire beast.</p><div class='title'><b>Pacific Ocean</b></div><p>I continued along the coastline of the ocean.  The last place I visited was the overlook near the Sakihirami Park <span class='ja'>先平見公園</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6445_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6457_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6457_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6457_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6457_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6457_stitch.webp" /></a></p><p>Nothing too special.  It offered a similar view as the other places, but had an unofficial trail leading down to the ocean.  There were some ropes set up to help hikers keep themselves from slipping and falling, but it wasn't too bad.</p><p>The edge of grass and dirt was met with a beach of rocks, smoothed and carved from the constant battering of ocean waves.  Every step unstable, and balancing on the moderately sized rocks piled onshore.  Closer to the water, pure rock covered in moss crept up from underneath the rubble housing pockets of miniature oceans.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6491.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6491.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6491_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6491_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6491_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6509_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6509_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6509_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6509_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6509_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6571.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6571.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6571_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6571_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_6571_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Within these pockets lie stranded sea life.

They did their tricks and got their small treats as rewards.</p><p>After watching <a href="/old/v7/the-cove" title="/the-cove">The Cove</a> all those years ago, I can't stop thinking about the well-being of these dolphins, or really any animal in captivity.  The Cove made mention that dolphins communicate and hear through echo-location and sound.  The subtle reverberations of their pings bouncing off walls and objects in the open water to give them a sense of location.</p><p>In a tank, they're obviously trapped and surrounded by sound.  What's worse is the sound of the announcer from the speakers blaring overhead.  And the crowd clapping and cheering them on.  It can be sensory overload for a dolphin or   a porpoise.  Many captive dolphins commit suicide, or damage themselves by ramming into the sides of their tank to try and make the pain go away.  At least, for ones caught in the wild.</p><p>I think there's some law enacted that states dolphins, orca, and other porpoises can no longer be caught in the wild for the porpoises of captivity because it's so damaging and harmful to them.  Only sea-mammals born and raised in captivity are allowed to be kept in captivity.  </p><p>This is probably directly because of their echo-location senses.  Being born and raised in captivity allows them to live with the noise their entire life, and adapt from the very beginning.  Though, this means they could never be released in the wild.  We've basically split their species on a different evolutionary path, much like dogs and wolves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But, they flip around and jump around, and everyone claps.  I wonder what actually compels these dolphins to obey.  They are just animals, but they're smarter than most.  Smarter than dogs.  I wonder if they have some kind of loyalty gene as well, and since we've had them in captivity long enough, those loyalty genes have been passed on to their offspring, continuing the cycle, breeding a more loyal dolphin.</p><p>At some point, this gets just as perverse as dog breeding.

Successfully capturing and killing one of these massive creatures could easily feed the town for months.  Back in the day, whales used to come quite close the coast.  Hundreds of years ago, there were very few large ships patrolling the oceans, and there were all made of wood.  They were no mechanical noises to ward away the creatures of the sea.</p><p>The hunters of the village, would get into smaller boats (models shown above), and extend very large nets between multiple ships.  Once a whale was captured in the nets, and they could get close, the hunters repeatedly stabbed and skewered the beast with their spears.  Eventually wounding it enough, to be pulled onto the beach, and killed.</p><p>Such effort must have taken almost an entire day.  Even when killer whales kill a seal in the open ocean, it takes about 8 hours before they've beaten it enough for it to quit fighting back.

| May 6, 2015 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Yesterday, I took part in the Nakagawa Half Marathon <span class='ja'>中川ハーフマラソン</span>, located in a beautiful valley of southern Nagano prefecture <span class='ja'>長野県</span>.  I came across this marathon by browsing through <a href="http://runnet.jp/" title="http://runnet.jp/">runnet.jp</a>, Japan's premiere website for signing up for marathons.  (Very similar to active.com in the states.)  Unlike the Takaoka Marathon, which I've "run" twice now (<a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">Nov 18th, 2013</a>, <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2" title="/takaoka-marathon-2">Jun 18th, 2014</a>), this was much more laid back and treated as a community event, rather than an athletic competition.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1200.webp" /></p><p>They actually had a marathon expo prior to the event where people could do packet pick-up.  I was unable to make it there the day before, so I went the morning of the marathon.  Packet Pick-up was quite smooth.  With each packet, you could enter a raffle to win several local goods.  I won an apple.</p><p>Inside the packet was a bunch of advertisement, and coupons.  Also included is the marathon "program" which includes a list of ALL participants.  The Takaoka Marathon did this, too.  Looking through the list, I was one of only 3 or 4 foreign participants, out of the entire ~3000 person list.  They gave out 2 bibs, too.  The front one contains the timing chip.  The back one shows which prefecture you've come from.</p><div class='title'><b>Opening Ceremony errata</b></div><p>On the day of the race, the expo was open from 7:00am to 8:20am.  At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony. </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1205.webp" /></p><p>This lasted 40 minutes. :/  The speakers didn't take all that long, but the special guests absorbed a ton of time.  Musical guest: Parallel Dream came to cheer us on.  This is an idol group from Nagano.  And M<span class='ja'>高史</span> (Takashi), which is apparently some kind of famous runner, or a comedian, or both? I dunno.</p><p>They entertained the crowd, and then everyone did the morning exercise routine.  I left and wandered around.</p><p>The race finally began at 9:30am.  I really miss the 7:00am start times in America.</p><div class='title'><b>The Course</b></div><p>M<span class='ja'>高史</span> fired the starting pistol, and then started giving everyone high-fives as they ran passed him.  It was SO congested, I don't think I started actually running until 1km in.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1225.webp" /></p><p>For the first 3.5km, it was completely uphill.  We started at 470m above sea level, and kept climbing and climbing.  At 3.5km, we reached the highest point in the marathon, 620m.</p><p>The view along the way was great.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1226_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1231_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going downhill is so much easier.  Gravity does most of the work. :)  But, it was still too congested to actually glide down the hill.  And now we were running against the people behind us still climbing the hill.</p><p>Just past the 4km mark, the last person went by, and road width essentially doubled.  I launched myself into the other lane, and somewhat leapt down the hill.  Stride, stride, stride.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1241_t.webp" /></a></p><p>We continued down through a neighborhood and past several bridges.  The roads weren't completely shut down, so some cars would drive by, and try to make it through the packs of people.</p><p>Around the 8km, the "bottom" of the course became visible.  The lowest point of 420m, which were flat farm plots.  You were able to see almost everyone in front of you, and the direction of the course.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1261_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1263_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When running marathons, I really prefer to think about the course one mile, or one kilometer at a time.  I like knowing which mile or kilometer I'm running, but being able to see the entire course is just too much to take in.  "I need to run all of that?!"  And there are so many people in front of me.  Bleh…</p><p>On top of that, the course zig-zags around the rice fields, rather than going in a straight line.  It's somewhat demoralizing when a course doesn't take the most efficient route.  It feels like I'm wasting time, rather than getting to the finish as fast as I can.</p><p>It's quite beautiful, though. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1276_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1287_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last leg of the course was an uphill climb to the finish line.  At this point, it was nice to look back and see the course, and remind myself just how far I've traveled.  Seeing the course here is way more rewarding rather than seeing it near the middle of the run.</p><p>Only a short kilometer or two remaining, until crossing the finish line.  After crossing the finish line, they drape you in a large tower with the marathon's logo on it.  Really nice.  My time was 2 hours 40 minutes 13 seconds.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150505_nakagawa/IMG_1299_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not bad. :)  I did a bit better than I thought I would.  Continuing back to the expo hall, you could take some bottled water, fruit, and other post-race food.  Like an actual marathon back in the states!</p><p>Overall, I really liked this race.  It went through some beautiful scenery, and with the 3 hour limit, there were many more casual racers, rather than a legion of athletes.  The race was nice and casual, and was very fun.  This race was the most like any marathon I've done back in the states.  Very positive, and fun.</p><p>I'll definitely do this again next time.</p><p><u>Update (June 25th):</u>  Man.. I have been 100% sick since doing this race.  I've been coughing every day, and my lungs are constantly full of flem.  Ech.  I most've inhaled pollen or dust or something airborne during this race that has ruined my lungs. :(</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Fukui Dinosaur Museum" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/fukui-dinosaur-museum">Fukui Dinosaur Museum</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It takes about 2 hours to make it to the area, and between here and there are the western peaks of the Japanese Alps.  Half of the journey is using the smooth and fast Tollway.  </p><p>The second half is taking a narrow winding road that follows the outline of the mountains and the lakes and rivers their runoff have created.  On a chill clear February morning, it looks beautiful.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3012_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For a couple of days this year, we've had this amazing clear weather with absolutely no clouds in the sky.  The sky a deep blue, and all the surrounding mountains completely visible.  At night, every star in the star can be seen with the naked eye.</p><p>We stopped twice to take some photos along the mountain road.  This was along Lake Kuzuryu <span class='ja'>九頭竜湖</span> still east of the village Kuzuryu <span class='ja'>九頭竜</span>.  Kelly pointed out that kanji stands for 9 <span class='ja'>九</span> + Head <span class='ja'>頭</span> + Dragon <span class='ja'>竜</span>.

It's very easy to park and gain access.  Today it sits next to acres of farmland and rice fields.  Even back in the day, the setting would not be all that different.</p><p>It's unnatural.</p><p>Most Japanese castles sit on a mountain of rock laid by human hands, surrounded by castle walls and other towers and small buildings within the courtyard.  A castle isn't really a single building, but a center point of an entire complex, which, in turn, is usually the center point of an entire town.</p><p>The current structure labeled Katsuyama Castle is indeed unnatural.  According to the Internet, this is not its original location.  This building was built in 1992 by a successful and wealthy local who wanted to give something back to their hometown.  Apparently this whole thing cost around $70 million.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/150221_katsuyama/IMG_3488_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The whole thing is very ornamental, too.

One of my only goals in Tokyo was to visit Tokyo Skytree with the amazing weather for the weekend.  I went there last year, but didn't take many photos.  I wanted to correct that this time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0156_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tokyo Skytree is now the tallest free standing tower in the world.  Construction finished in late 2012, and it was built to accommodate the much wider-band television broadcasts for the high definition age that Tokyo Tower could not longer support.  As such, Tokyo Skytree acts as a symbol of the future.  The same symbol <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-tower-2014" title="/tokyo-tower-2014">Tokyo Tower</a> was 55 years ago.  </p><p>Skytree reaches 634 meters into the sky, which dwarfs Tokyo Tower's 333 meters.  634 is very deliberate choice.  Using <a href="/old/v7/goroawase" title="/goroawase">goroawase</a>, the kanji of 634 <span class='ja'>六三四</span> can be read as mu-sa-shi, which, apparently, is the old name for the neighborhood where Skytree stands.  Musashi is also the name of a famous samurai.  It probably has several other meanings, too.</p><p>I wanted to get there as early as possible, since the weather was supposed to get more cloudy as the day went on.  I left my hotel room around 7:30am to meet the 8:00 opening, but it took a lot longer to get there than I had thought.  I finally arrived at 9am, but it was still early enough to miss the crowds.  There was absolutely no line, which was astonishing to me considering the hour wait from last year.  I was in the observation decks by 9:10.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9781_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9845_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9774_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_9805_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The first observation deck was at a height of 350 meters, already taller than Tokyo Tower.

The view from Tokyo Tower was probably amazing after its construction 60 years ago.  It's still amazing today, but many of the surrounding buildings have caught up to its height.  It's view is one amongst the city, rather than viewing it from above.</p><p>No other building in Tokyo comes close to the height of Skytree.  Every building is underneath its view.  So, It truly towers over the entire city.</p><p>The special observatory wraps around the outside of the tower with a slight incline.  You continue to climb until to reach the highest point in the tower.  Then it starts to decline back to the return elevatory.  I didn't spend too much more time in the tower after that.  On my way out, the place was completely packed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0136_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was at 11:00am.  When I arrived, two hours prior, there was absolutely no one here.  Maybe the shuttle buses didn't begin operation until after 9am or something.  I'm not quite sure why people wouldn't have come earlier to avoid this mess.</p><p>Outside, a few blocks away, I came across a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/141228_skytree/IMG_0154.webp">bootleg</a> merchandise shop.  Everything looked so cheap and crappy from the window that I did not inquire.</p><p>Anyway, there you go.  That's Tokyo Skytree.  It's pretty neat, though quite expensive.  Entrance is 2400<span class='ja'>円</span>, and an additional 1200<span class='ja'>円</span> to go to the special observatory.  I think it's worth it for a single visit, but not really for repeats.</p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sunset at Sunshine City 60" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sunset-at-sunshine-city-60">Sunset at Sunshine City 60</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">
