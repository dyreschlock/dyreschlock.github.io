Mt. Norikura is one of the tallest mountains in Japan at over 3000 meters.  It's probably the most "magnificent" mountain viewable from Takayama City.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" /></p><p>The Goshikigahara plateau lies within those highborn forests on the west end of the mountain.  Technically, the area should be visible in the above photo.  The forests in this area have never been cut, or disturbed by human hands.  </p><p>In fact, the locals swear that the forests are inhabited by a specie of fairy.  They chat and play in the forest.  Female fairies twinkle like a rainbow.  Male fairies have a silver twinkle.  These fairy are only visible to humans who are pure of heart.  Any person that has caused harm to the environment by littering, or picking or breaking plants will never see them.  Which pretty much rules out everyone on earth.</p><p>If you want to tour Goshikigahara, you must make a reservation, and be accompanied with a guide to show you around.  Tours are about 8500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> ($85) at the lowest, and generally take about 7 hours.  You need to sign a consent form, too.</p><p>On this particular day, I was quite fortunate to be part of a tour put together by the city of Takayama.  It was only 6000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>, too. :) This tour was in honor of a very special guest that came to Takayama, Dr. Miya____?  On Saturday, volunteer city officials joined the doctor at the Hida Wisdom Earth Center, and planted a field of trees.  I joined them as part of the city.</p><p>On Sunday, we met with the doctor again as we started our 9 hour trek through the mountainous forest.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9357.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_2547.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Short Course <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ショートコース</span></span></b></div><p>The tour brought us along the <b>Short Course</b> of Goshikigahara.  The short course is the back half of the <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>シラビソコース</span></span>, or the Abies Veitchii Course.  But we started a little bit early and took a stroll through the wasabi fields.</p><div class='title'><b>Wasabi Daira Marshland <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>わさび平湿原</span></span></b></div><p>Before reaching the Iwanami Hut, and the start of Short course, the bus dropped us off not too far away, where the trail crossed the road and entered the wasabi daira shitsugen (marshland).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9358.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9358.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9358.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9358.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9381.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9381.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9381.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9381.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9381.webp" /></p><p>It was a rather damp day, as you can see from the photos.  We started walking the course around 9:30am.  There was a light rain in the air.  It was nothing heavy or torrential.  It made the wooden walking bridge incredibly slick, though.  Our group continued across it at a very slow pace to make sure no one slipped and hurt themselves.</p><p>We stopped every couple of minutes, and Dr. Miya___? gave a speech explaining the surrounding fauna.  When we reached the actual wasabi plants, he bent down, and pulled up a wasabi plant for all of us to examine.  Each of us, pricked a tiny portion of the plant and ate it.  I could definitely taste a hint of wasabi, but it wasn't nearly as potent as the stuff you'd have at restaurants, or grocery stores.  He gave us another wasabi plant to taste.  This time, I tried part of the stem, and that definitely held the potent spicy flavor I was used to.</p><p>We continued through the light rain, and Miya___? continued to give light explanations of the environment around us.</p><p>After about 40 minutes, we reached the road once again and met with the Snake Dashidani Bridge <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>蛇出谷橋</span></span> (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>じゃだしだに</span></span>).  And right next to the bridge, was the first waypoint, and the beginning of the Short Course.</p><div class='title'><b>1.

We rested for a little bit, but the mosquitoes in the area were terrible.  Constantly buzzing into your face, eyes, nose, and ears.  The guides put together their bug repellent contraptions.  Other people starting putting our their bug spray.</p><p>Dr. Miya___? continued to talk about the surrounding fauna.  In the above picture, he mentioned that the plants under our feet are incredibly resilient.  They can be stepped on, or driven over, but they are unharmed and continue to grow.  </p><p>The plants behind him are grass and weeds that have grown without the intervention of mankind.  Without anyone cutting them, or taking care of them, nature can grow completely out of hand on its own.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Iwanami Hut was the end of the journey for the doctor.  He was not able to travel with us for the entirety of the hike today.  But, it was great to be able to meet him, and partially understand some of the wisdom he attempted to impart on me.</p><p>At this point, our big group split into 2.  The men formed the first group, and the women formed a group behind us.  There were 6 of us, including the guide.  We left to begin the Short Course around 10:30am.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9440.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9437.webp" /></p><p>The road continued into the woods.  Much like Miya___?, our guide pointed out many of the interesting plants.  The above plants were described at trumpets by the local people who first came to the mountain thousands of years ago.  Several creeks, and water flows ran underneath the road carrying the rain water the pounded us earlier.</p><p>But, our path was basically just a road.  There was enough room for any automobile to drive up here, so it didn't really feel like some mountainous path.  It just felt like a service road.</p><p>20 minutes after we began the Short Course, we reached our first waypoint.</p><div class='title'><b>2. Shirabe Marsh Entrance / <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>シラベ沢口</span></span></b></div><p>The Shirabe Marsh Entrance (<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>さわぐち</span></span>) marked the highest point in our hike at 1640 meters.  There was a clearing, which was probably for any vehicles to turn around.  There was a pretty gnarly lookin' tree on one side, and the path to the woods on the other.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9443.webp" /></p><p>We entered the path, and this felt like the true start to our hike.  This was the Seseragi <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>せせらぎ</span></span> path down the mountain.  It followed a stream of water.  This path was about 1.3 kilometers long, and took us down 150 meters in sea level.</p><p>We stopped several times as our guide explained what we were seeing in the forest.</p><p>He talked about the mushrooms and other fungus of the forest.  They are basically the "cleaners" of the forest.  Any dying or decaying matter in the forest is eaten by the fungus, and recycled back into nutrients for the living creatures of the forest.  The eat away disease and rot, and keep everything clean.</p><p>Additionally, as shown in the photo below, many of the trees have slight bulges in their trunks.  These are small pockets of sap squeezed out from the interior of the tree.  This sap is also vital to the ecological system of the forest, providing animals, and insects food and nutrients to sustain their lives.</p><p class='img'><img

All the water we had met through our journey down the mountain feel down these 20 or 30 meters in the pools below.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9821.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9827_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9850b_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>9. Nunobiki Falls <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>布引滝</span></span></b></div><p>Next we met the actual treasure of this hiking trail, the Nunobiki Falls, which were directly next to the Yokote and Sakura-kon waterfalls.  Unlike the other 2 falls, the water forming Nunobiki was completely natural, squeezed from the rocks and reservoirs below the surface.  No amount of rain water would ever change the way these falls look.</p><p>This is rather evident when looking at the shape of the falls.  Rather than a concentrated source of water flowing over a cliff, several scattered pockets of water are shot through the cliff face, and flowing down the side.  If this waterfall was formed by a creek, stream or river, a singular focal point would've been carved out of the round over the course of thousands of years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After passing by the falls, I noticed something that was clearly manmade, and not in use for quite a while.  Apparently the early settlers of these lands mined for copper, zinc and iron.  The above structure was carved out of the rock to channel the water from the falls, and generate electricity for the mines.  In this area, watermills were set up to collect the energy and pass it on to the mines.</p><p>I guess, over the years, those watermills were removed to preserve the nature the falls.</p><div class='title'><b>10. Deai Hut <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>出合い小屋</span></span></b></div><p>A few hundred meters away was our final destination of the hike.  We got there around 2:30pm.  Our busses were already waited for us at the Deai Hut.  We went inside, and got a chance to change our clothes again, so we weren't walking around soaking wet.</p><p>We got there well before the women's group, so nearby our guide showed us some funky moss.  Underneath some nearby rocks were moss than reflected any light passing into it.  I'm not sure if my photo really highlights this interesting phenomena, but it was a neat trick.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" /></p><p>Despite being a cold and rainy day, I think the hike was totally worth it.  For the last year and a half, I've lived in the foothills off these mountains, and never saw any of this stuff up close.</p><p>One of the greatest things about living in Takayama is the vast amount of nature that surrounds me everyday.  Well over half the city's area is covered in this wilderness forged from the depths of earth at the basins of several volcanoes.  It's absolutely stunning and beautiful. :)</p><p>Hopefully before I leave Takayama, I'll have a chance to hike the second trail available, which features many more waterfalls.<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Takaoka Marathon 2014" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon-2">Takaoka Marathon 2014</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 18, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Last weekend, I attended the Takaoka Half Marathon for the second time.  Last year, the race was in November, and it was a much cooler day.  I wrote about that here: <a href="/old/v7/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">November 18th</a>.  </p><p>Last year, although, I trained and was in alright shape, the time limits set by the race prevented me from finishing.  I made it to the 17.3km gate at 1 minute too late.  So, I definitely planned on signing up again and vowing to complete the marathon!</p><div class='title'><b>This Year</b></div><p>Well, I did not train nearly as much as I did last year.  Last year, there were other people I signed up with, and we trained a few times together, and had some fun.  We were a team.  This year, it was just me.  And I had been so busy and tired with school that I barely trained at all.  I am still doing Kendo, but even then, I still occasionally miss Kendo practice due to the amount work needed to teach at my schools.</p><p>So, I was not nearly in the shape I was last year.  I was totally prepared for not finishing.  In fact, my time probably would've been better spent had I simply skipped the event.  But whatever…  I'll still drive down there, and make it as far as I can.</p><div class='title'><b>The Race</b></div><p>This year's course was identical to last year's.  Of course, this year it was in June, rather than November.  The morning wasn't too bad.  There was a nice breeze, and the clouds prevented the sun from heating everyone up.</p><p>At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony, where the Takaoka athletic association said some words, and last year's winners came up to the front and said their words, too.  Blah blah blah, I have no idea what they said.</p><p>After the opening ceremony, the half marathon race was the first to gather at the starting line.  Then the clouds started to open up and let the sun in.  Ugh, it was hot.  At 9am, some old guy fired his starting pistol and everyone was off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Time Limits</b></div><p>Once again, just like last year, the race had a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  This limit is enforced by 2 intermediary checkpoints throughout the race.  The first checkpoint is at 12.7km for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The second checkpoint is at 17.3km for 2 hours.  If you make it to these checkpoints late, the volunteers will stop you, and force you to quite.  Then you must wait for a bus to pick you up and bring you back to the start.  </p><p>Last year, I made the first checkpoint, but could not pass the second one.  I was only 1 minute late. :/</p><p>With the shape I was in this year, I had no intention of doing any better.  In order to complete the checkpoints, and the race, I needed to keep a pace of less than 7 minutes per kilometer (that's around 11 minutes per mile).</p><p>Whatever… let's get this marathon over with.</p><div class='title'><b>Running</b></div><p>Again, the course was the same.  But, since I was running at a much more leisurely pace, I stopped to take a few more photos than last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" /></p><p>I really tried at the beginning, but after 2k, my body was too fat, and heavy, and I was not going to have the energy to overcome it.  Additionally, I kept thinking about all the crap still outstanding on my to-do list, and the increasingly little time I had to complete them.  Ugh, why am I here?  Why am I doing this?  This isn't fun.  I'm not really getting anything out of this either.</p><p>The increasing pressure of all my responsibilities kept me from actually enjoying the run, and thinking about things clearly.  Usually during a marathon, I can push away all of my thoughts, empty my mind, and think about things without any noise.  My brain stops trying to analyze everything, and I can simply think…</p><p>All I could think about were my upcoming classes, and all the preparation work I still needed to do, and try to figure out when I could actually do the work.  And then think about my classes after, and how was I going to have the energy to do any of this after running this race.</p><p>So, this marathon sucked, and I did terrible at it.  Though, there were a few sparing moments I could lose myself in my music, but then came the crushing reality of my fat ass.</p><div class='title'><b>"Finishing"</b></div><p>Anyway, at around 10 o'clock, I passed the 9km marker.  I quickly thought to myself that I was still alright for time.  Only 3km left to the 12km checkpoint.  I can make that in 30 minutes.  15 minutes later, I remembered that the checkpoint was actually 12.7km, and that my pace was terrible.</p><p>I passed the 12km before the 10:30 mark, but arrived at the checkpoint more than 6 minutes late.</p><p>Whooo, failure!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't the only one there, and there were still people behind me, too.  I still have not broken my cardinal rule of not placing last in a race.  I was only 7th or 8th from last!</p><p>Once everyone else behind us got to the checkpoint, the bus of shame arrived to transport everyone back to the start.  We traversed the course backwards, and made it back to the start before 11am.  So, there were still people finishing the race as we arrived.  Our tracking chips were returned in the bus, though, so we couldn't just jump back on the track and finish the race. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" /></p><p>So, while I didn't finish the race, and did much more horribly than last year, I was able to leave much earlier and not damage my legs too much.  The race was still finishing as I walked back to my car to return to Takayama.</p><div class='title'><b>Vow</b></div><p>I still vow to complete this race in the future!  I wonder if this race happens twice a year, which explains the date change from last year.  November was way more comfortable to run, too.  The heat was terrible for this race. :(<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Battleship Island - Gunkanjima 軍艦島" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/gunkanjima-2">Battleship Island - Gunkanjima 軍艦島</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 1, 2014 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>At it's peak of operation, this island was the most densely population place on earth, and still holds that title today.  This is <b>Hashima</b>, or, by its nickname, "Battleship Island".  It exists in the Sea of Japan just 15km west of Nagasaki City.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140328_gunkanjima/IMG_3790.webp" /></p><p>Coal was first discover on the island in 1810, and a small mining operation existed.  The first official mineshaft opened in 1887.  Production on the island didn't really turn into a massive settlement until the Mitsubishi bought the island, and increased it's magnitude.  At the height of its operation, the population of the island was around 5300 people.</p><p>After World War II, and the adoption of petroleum, people began to use coal less and less.  So with the demand waning, the island became more and more obsolete.  On January 15th, 1974, closed the last operating mineshaft.  And on April 20th, the last residents of the Hashima left the island forever.  The island remained abandoned and unkept after that.</p><p>In 2002, Mistubishi relinquished ownership to Takashima-machi.  And with a government restructuring in 2005, it now became part of Nagasaki City.  After years of work, planning, and construction, tourism finally opened on the island almost 35 years to the day it closed down, April 22nd, 2009.</p><p>May 2010 was the last time I had visited Nagasaki.  I went with Dave, and we met Ikuko who was very insistent that we visit this place.  So, we did. ^_^   Unfortunately, the weather was not very good, and I wasn't in a good position to take many good photos.  Here are the photos I was able to take: <a href="/old/v7/gunkanjima" title="/gunkanjima" title="/gunkanjima">May 19th, 2010</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Preservation</b></div><p>Up until Nagasaki's acquisition of the island, no attempt to upkeep or preserve the island had taken place.  It suffered from weather, rotting, and general decay for over 30 straight years.  There is massive concern from the city about the safety of the island, especially inside the decaying building.</p><p>This is why it took 4 years, with delays, to open the island to regular tourism.  And then, even on the island, tourists are closely watched, and the areas you can visit are very very minimal.  On the island, the walkway is as far the edge of the island as possible.  Far away from any of the residentially buildings, and any collateral damage if one of the buildings should collapse.</p><p>Nagasaki wants to preserve the buildings and other structures on the island, but the cost is too high for the city.  Constant tourism brings in money to help that, but it's still not enough.</p><p>In Nagasaki, right now, there's a massive campaign to have Hashima, and several other parts of Nagasaki, listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site.  If successful, they should receive funding to further preserve the island, and make it even more accessible to tourists.</p><div class='title'><b>Current Tourism</b></div><p>So, last Friday, March 28th, was the second time I have been to the island.  The last time was May 10th, 2010, and the procedure was completely identical as it is today.  You buy passage on a boat from Nagasaki Harbor.  You take a cruise to the island.  The boat circles around the island for a little bit.  Then you land on the island, and a tour guide shows off the parts of the island you can see, and talks about the history.  You walk around on the very cornered off part of the island away from the decaying buildings.  And then you go back to the harbor.</p><p>Unlike the first time I visited, the weather was absolutely perfect.  Clear skies, clear water.

I was a study abroad student, and I lived in Nagasaki City.  Over the course of the those years, I've come back to visit a few times.  Each time I visit, many things have stayed the same.  But many other things have changed, too.</p><p>Also, I had different cameras in 2006, 2008, and 2014, so you can also see the difference in image quality. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Nishi Hamanomachi</b></div><p>The main area downtown has changed a little bit.

Many of the major and minor arcades we used to visit on the regular basis were gone on my subsequent visits to Nagasaki.  I can't really say why..  Maybe it was because of the global recession, or the continued rise of mobile games in Japan, or just the stagnation of the Japanese video game industry.  I dunno..</p><p>Within the first block of Hamanomachi there was a Sega arcade, I went to on a frequent basis.  This place is pretty easy to identify because it's a fricken pyramid.  They had some bitchin' retro games, and fighting games on the second floor.  The first floor was full of UFO and Purikura machines.</p><p>Anyway, in 2008, it was gone.  Come back in 2014, and it's alive again as an indy arcade. :)</p><div class='title'><b>September 2006</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02373.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>April 2008</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080410_nagasaki/IMG_0478.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>March 2014</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_3689.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_3689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_3689.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_3689.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_3689.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Suwa Shrine</b></div><p>Suwa Shrine is the most prominent major shrine is Nagasaki City.

It must've been rather difficult for the residents of those times to be crammed into such a dank and uncommodating structure.  Every being inside it, the air is still, and the walls are cold.  Rooms are small, and the hallways are narrow.  It's very constricting and claustrophobic.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4377.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4377.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4377.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4377.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4377.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4379.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4379.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4379.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4379.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4379.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4389.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4389.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4396.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4396.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4396.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4396.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_4396.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Amu Plaza</b></div><p>Like any visitors or resident of Nagasaki City, the first structure you enter in the city from the train is Amu Plaza.

Our beloved Taito Station in Sumiyoshi is no longer in operation.  I think that went out of business before I visited in 2008.  The McDonalds is still totally there, though, which is weird.  The whole building hasn't changed in the last 7 1/2 years, so the top 3 floors must've been vacant all this time.</p><p>Something new we saw in 2010 was Coco Walk: a massive new American style mall near Urakami station that also serves as a bus station.  I have no recollection of what was there before this mall, but it is now a staple of the landscape.  You can clearly see it from Mt. Inasa, too.</p><p>Something else that has changed recently is that Toys R Us in Michinoo is now out of business.  </p><p>So, several things have changed throughout the years, but many things have not.  I remember Nagasaki so well, that I never really pulled out Google Maps to figure out where I was going.  Even using the busses, I remember the areas, and can read the Kanji on the bus stop, that I could figure out what bus to take easily.  I totally remember my bus stop (the bus stop in near Beardo) being <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>寺川内</span></span>.</p><div class='title'><b>The Future</b></div><p>There are plenty more changes coming in the future.  Signs near Amu Plaza show Nagasaki City's intention for completely renovating Nagasaki Station.  The train tracks between the station and Urakami station will be completely elevated to elevate traffic and move the actual station away from Amu Plaza.  And then it looks like they plan on building another line going out of the station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140329_nagasaki/IMG_0646.webp" /></p><p>Interesting times ahead.

| November 18, 2013 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>When I came to Japan to work, I had 3 goals for the year.  One of which was to run in a half marathon over here, and today I finally accomplished that goal.  Some of the teachers I work with at an elementary school in town signed up to run in the Takaoka marathon.  Takaoka is a suburb of Toyama city about an hour and a half north of Takayama by highway.  Toyama has a population of about 425,000 people, so it's a bit bigger than Takayama.  Also, Toyama is right on the Sea of Japan, and not in the mountains, so it's about 10 degrees more warm.</p><p>The start time for the Half Marathon was 9am.  We left Takayama around 6:30am, just to make sure we'd get there with enough time.  We arrived around 8am, and didn't really have a whole lot to do for an hour.  Packet PIck-up was only available the morning of, so we collected our T-Shirts, bibs, race booklet, and what not.  This event was hosted by the University of Takaoka, so there weren't any merchandise tents, or similar things.  </p><p>It was a very academic and non-commercial event.  And many of the runners that showed up, seemed like professional athletes.  Way different than the marathons I've run before.  In the US, the marathons are an excuse for people to get into shape, and do their best.  It gives people a reason to exercise, and see if they can actually accomplish the feat of covering 13 miles by only using your legs.</p><p>The Takaoka marathon seemed like it was more of a contest for athletes.  There were several elderly people there, who weren't viewing this as a race, but many of the other runners were pretty serious.  Out of the 672 Half marathon participants, it didn't seem like many were just there for exercise and for fun.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0334.webp" /></p><p>I put on my headphones, and began listening to Underworld as the starting horn fired.  The first 1 or 2 kilometers of this race were terrible.  At the start of any marathon, the route is completed congested, so you need to give a wide area for everyone to move around each other.  Let the fast glide through the crowd, so they don't ruin their pace.</p><p>The start of the race went around the race track, down the hill, and then around another race track so the entire course could fit the 21.1 kilometers of a half marathon.  Ugh?  They should really add the course stretching segments towards the middle of the race.</p><p>After getting away from the beginning, the whole course was really rather nice.  The course took us up to the beach of the Sea of Japan, then back through the country-side a little bit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0343.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0344.webp"/></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/131118_takaoka/IMG_0346.webp"/></p><p>Before running the race, I knew their was a time limit.  You had to finish under 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I was running around the 15 kilometer when I started actually thinking about this and doing the math in my head.  "Let's see..  150 divided by 20 is 7.5.  7 times 21 is 147.. " I was running at about 7 minutes per km, so I figured I was in good shape to finish.  But, I really had no idea what would happen if I didn't make the 2:30.</p><p>Well, at 17.4km, I came face-to-face with what happens.  You're forced to retire.  At the 17.4 km mark, there was a 2 hour checkpoint, which I arrived at 2 hours 1 minute and 49 seconds.  I guess 7 minutes per km wasn't fast enough.  I arrived, and the dude said, it's finished.  A few more people behind me caught up, and were also stopped.  Bahh..</p><p>A few minutes later, the bus of shame showed up and we all got inside.  Something I didn't realize at the time was I had already passed the 1 hour 30 minute checkout a few kilometers back at 12.7km.  I mean, I saw the clock and everything, but I didn't realize that was a "do or die" checkpoint.  I made it there around 1:27 or 1:28.</p><p>The bus of shame had about 20 people.  The bus drove us back to the start on the rest of the course.  We easily caught up to the last 2 people who made it through the 2 hour check mark, and they were just walking the whole way back.  Pfftt, what kind of bullshit is that.  I was going at a faster pace than these guys were.  I could have easily made the 2:30 finish line.  Bahh..</p><p>I had to turn in my bib, rather than be able to keep it.  Whatever.</p><p>I suppose this is why there were so many athletes present, rather than casual marathon runners.  But, at least I now know what I'm getting into for these marathons in Japan.  It seems that they all have a time limit, and they do clearly mark all the checkpoints on the website, and in the information packet.</p><p>So, while I completed my goal of running in a marathon in Japan, it feels rather disappointing since I didn't finish.  Well, for 2014, I definitely plan on running again, and actually completing one!<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kirishima National Park" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park">Kirishima National Park</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

These pictures of mine were original taken on <b>May 16th, 2010</b> when Dave and I want on a vacation to Kyushu, Japan.  We visited our friend Brett in Kagoshima, my friend Ikuko in Nagasaki, and we stopped off at Kumamoto, Shimabara, and Fukuoka.  On our second day in Kagoshima, we took a train northeast to Kirishima National Park.</p><p>Kirishima National Park is a volcanic mountain range with hiking trails that go up and down most of the mountains and volcanoes in the area.  From Kirishima's train station we hopped in a cab that took us Ebino-kogen.  The cab driver asked what we planned on doing in Kirishima, and I relayed my ambitious plan on hiking all 5 major mountains in the mountain range.  He replied with disbelief and caution from what I could tell.  As he brought Dave and I to our destination, he gave us his business card in case we were stuck somewhere and needed a ride.</p><p>He also gave us a engilsh map of the entire park which looks a lot like <a href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park">this</a>.  That way we wouldn't get lost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7355.webp" /></p><p>Above is the map posted on the side of the road up the hill from Ebino-kogen.  We were on the red dot just a little east of Ebino-kogen.  My plan for Dave and I was to hike up Karakuni, and continue on over Shishiko-dake, Shinmoe-dake, Naka-dake, and Takachiho-mine.  And then catch a bus to a train station on the east or west side of Takachiho.  It was about 10am, I think, so I figured we had plenty of time to scale all 5 mountains/volcanoes.</p><p>We started along the hiking trail that lead up Karakuni-dake.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7356.webp" /></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7358_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7368_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the opposite direction was a pile of rock and ash.

Man, I felt ready to tackle the next mountain on our list.  Though, before even leaving the peak of Karakuni-dake we had to go past a couple signs that said it was a bad idea.  The sign said, "Climbing Mt. Shinmoe is forbidden due to volcanic activity," along with a picture of a volcano erupting.  Whatever... that's just a suggestion.</p><p>We continued along the path, but this path was a lot less stable than the one we climbed up.  Much of the path had been washed away by landslides.  The rock and foot holds weren't stable, so I slipped quite a bit as I tried to press on.  Dave kept trying to convince me that this wasn't a good idea, and after slipping one too many times I finally agreed that we should turn around and go back.</p><p>This is probably what the cab driver was trying to warn us about.  And since I wasn't listening to his cautions, he probably gave us his phone number so wherever we ended up we could still get back to the train station.

Traveling down a mountain is so much nicer than going up.  I think it took us about 30 minutes to get down to the crossroads before we set on the next trail that lead up the dormant volcano surrounding lake Oonami.  I think it took us another 15 minutes traveling along the Oonami trail before we caught our first glimpse of the volcanic lake.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7572_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7592_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7622.webp" /></p><p>It was quite gorgeous, and scenic.

Looking back at <a href="/old/v7/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park" title="/kirishima-national-park">this map</a>, we were on the other side of Oonami-ike and it was almost 2pm, or maybe it was 1:30pm.  I had a bus schedule on me that I must've picked up from the train station, that said the last bus heading out from Ebino-kogen was 3pm.  Back to the map, it would take us about an hour and a half for us to make it there.  </p><p>We had no time to spare anymore, and had to start bookin' it back to the bus stop.  Of course, we could've just taken a cab back to the train station, but we would rather pay the $3 rather than the $25 it was earlier in the day.  And I figured it might be a bit difficult to call our cab driver and explain the situation since my Japanese is not good.  So, we made some fast tracks to the bus stop.  Hiking is much more intense when you're running across the terrain at running speeds.</p><p>Trying to run, and climb over stuff like this is crazy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100516_kirishima_1024/IMG_7637.webp" /></p><p>The closer we got, the more of the terrain began to level off.  And as the trail ended we were able to keep a decent jogging pace on the paved road as we neared the bus stop.  I believe we made it there with 5 minutes to spare!</p><p>The journey back to Kagoshima was relaxing and enjoyable.  A reward for a fantastic day of climbing dormant and active volcanoes.<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/7">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/travel/5">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
