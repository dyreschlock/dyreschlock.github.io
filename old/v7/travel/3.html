| April 15, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Japan is a country rich in history, and a country that is rich in history is also rich in museums. There are many national and prefectural museums that focus on the history of Japan both for culture and art. However, almost all of these museums focus on periods of Japan up through the Meiji era (through 1912) and World War II. Very few focus on the development of Japan after.</p><p>To pick up the slack, there are many independent <b>Retro</b> museums that can be found in small towns and resort towns. Owners of these museums curate their personal collections of 50-60 year old technology and memorabilia. Most of these gathered from friends or business upgrading their old stuff.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1800_t.webp"></a></p><p>The <b>Gifu Retro Museum</b> is a little different than other retro museum I've been to before. It does curate stuff from the past, but it would be more accurate to call this a Retro Amusement Center. The entry fee is timed, rather than a flat fee.</p><p><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><u>Adults to Junior High students</u><br/>One hour is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 3000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column"><u> Elementary school students </u><br/>One hour is 500<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 1300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 2000<span class='ja'>円</span></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><u>Children ages 4 to 6 years old</u><br/>One hour is 300<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>Three Hours is 800<span class='ja'>円</span><br/>All Day is 800<span class='ja'>円</span></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The "museum" is divided into three distinct separate rooms, each with their own distinctive feel and purpose. I'm sure that the entry pass is required for all three areas. The three rooms are the main room in the middle, which has snacks and arcade machines, the pachinko room on the right, and the food lounge to the left. </p><div class='title'><b>Main Room</b></div><p>When you enter the middle room, there are old posters and knick knacks pinned to the wall and sitting on old arcade machines and soda machines. When you exit the immediate entrance area, you exit an old style candy shop with lots of sweets and candy for sale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><p>A few arcade games and several amusement games are fit against the walls where there is space. There is a wack-a-mole game and racing game that probably distributed tickets back in the day. There's a flag game, where the characters tell you to raise or lower flags. There's also a Janken game where you deposit some amount of coin medals. If you win, a roulette will spin and its possible to get 20 times your coins back.</p><p>For Arcade machines, they had an After Burner and Super Hang-on machine. They had a Neo Geo switcher with a few games installed. A cocktail Nintendo VS cabinet, with Super Mario Bros, Mario Bros, and a few others. They had a cabinet with Darkstalkers currently installed. (Curious if they had any other CPS2 games in the back.)</p><p>With the entry paid for time, all arcade games were set to Free Play. So, you could do whatever you like. I played the Flag game for a little bit, trying to quickly understand the Japanese, and I played the Janken game too. The Janken game would be a really fun programming project if I get the chance to learn FPGA programming.</p><div class='title'><b>Pachinko Room</b></div><p>The Main Room leads into the Pachinko room, which is also accessible from the outside. This seems to be the main draw for people to come here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1693_t.webp"/></a></p><p>The Pachinko room has two rows full of machines from the late 80s and early 90s. They probably rescued this from an old Pachinko parlor that was getting demolished. All machines work and already had a few people on them right as the museum opened in the morning.</p><p>I wasn't exactly sure how the room was supposed to work. In a real pachinko parlor, you buy your balls and go to town on a machine. But, I wasn't sure if you still bought balls even after paying the entry fee, or if you could just grab a tray and mess around? Bleh, I really should've asked, but I was already self-conscious enough with the clerks constantly watching me take photos.</p><p>This seems like a pretty good activity for the elderly people living in the town. Rather than have them blow tons of money at a real pachinko parlor, they could pay $30 to sit in here all day. They could play the pachinko games they may have played years ago, and try to beat each other's high scores. It would be an amazing place to have a pachinko tournament, too.</p><p>I would imagine you could use the balls for free because if you actually had to pay for the balls, then they would have to pay out if you actually won a lot.</p><div class='title'><b>Food Area</b></div><p>The third area to the right of the entrance is the food area where they have collected several vintage vending machines.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1792_t.webp"/></a></p><p>There were some vending machine that gave out ice cream and burgers, but many of them sold noodles. I think they were all in working order, but I didn't try any of them out. It was still early in the morning, and I had lunch plans for later.</p><p>The best part of this room was the Mac and Me banner advertising the home video release.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230415_retro/IMG_1786_stitch_t.webp"/></a></p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>I think if you plan on playing vintage Pachinko for a few hours, it would be worth the visit. But otherwise, there were too few arcade games to make it worthwhile and there really weren't that many knick knacks to consider it a true retro museum. It's a bit expensive, too, so I wouldn't really recommend it.</p><p>The <b>Gifu Retro Museum</b> is located in Yamagata City, north of Gifu. Here's the location in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7" title="https://goo.gl/maps/juY3r4GENaAaqQMN7">Google Maps</a>. The parking lot is behind the building, which can be difficult to understand when you first arrive.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Pokemon x Kogei ポケモンx工芸" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/pokemon-kogei">Pokemon x Kogei ポケモンx工芸</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| April 4, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>From March 21st through June 11th, the National Craft Museum in Kanazawa, Ishikawa is hosting an exhibit entitled, Pokemon x Kouge. Kouge <span class='ja'>工芸</span> is Japanese for crafts, such as pottery, woodworking, and any other profession that designs and creates materials and works. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0866_t.webp" /></a></p><p>20 Japanese artisans and craftsmen, from young to old, were challenged with how they could incorporate Pokemon into their works. How could they make something that could display the essence of a Pokemon, whether it be through their appearance, gestures, or traces of gameplay through trading, evolving, or battling? How would a particular Pokemon's personality or history clash or match with traditional crafts? With these questions and ideas, they have created over 70 original works displayed in this exhibit.</p><p>Here's the website: <a href="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/" title="https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/">https://kogei.pokemon.co.jp/</a></p><p>Also, here's the exhibit brochure:<br/><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK/view?usp=sharing"> https://drive.google.com/.../15OGmZfPQhPQv0CRP-g5c4rFEikUeRzLK</a></p><p>A friend sent me a link to this exhibit. I had seen a link about it before, but I didn't realize it was in Kanazawa. So close! I thought it was in Tokyo, or Osaka, or something. So, I went there on Thursday March 30th and arrived around 11:30am. There was a line to enter, but I only had to wait 20 minutes. Not too bad for a Thursday. They had reservation tickets available, which would probably be necessary on weekends. Individual tickets were 900<span class='ja'>円</span>. You can buy tickets online, too.</p><p>The exhibit was divided into three sections: Appearance, Stories, and Life. All of my photos are included at the bottom.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>すがたーせまる</span>！ Appearance - Approach!</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0894_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first room were works inspired by the appearance of the Pokemon. How does a Pokemon's appearance inspire these craftsmen to use their mastery to develop artwork that evokes both the spirit of the Pokemon and a demonstration of the mastery of their craft. This section featured artwork from Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> and Mitsuta Haruo <span class='ja'>満田晴穂</span> (both Metal Works), Fukuda Toru <span class='ja'>福田亭</span> (Wood Works), and Imai Sadamasa <span class='ja'>今井完眞</span> and Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span> (Ceramics).</p><p>My favorite pieces from this section was the Jolteon by Yoshida Taiichiro <span class='ja'>吉田泰一郎</span> (pictured above), and the vase and bowl entitled "Vase with Pokemon of the Universe" <span class='ja'>森羅万像ポケモン壷</span> and "Beautiful Bowl with the Super-Ancient of Pokemon" <span class='ja'>超古代ポケモン玉盌</span>. Both were created by Hayama Yuki <span class='ja'>葉山有樹</span>. (pictured below)</p><p>The Pokemon vase was interesting because you could stare at it for hours searching for various Pokemon and continue to find new ones you hadn't before. Also, I love how the Hoenn legendary pokemon are depicted in the Beautiful Bowl, clashing the power of fire, water, and wind.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0933_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_0915_stitch_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>ものがたりー浸る</span>！ Stories - Jump in!</b></div><p>The second room features works inspired by the aspects of the Pokemon adventure, such as catching, battling, and evolving.

All of the vases were really goofy, and the yukatas were pretty. The Yukatas, created by Shiromi Eiichi, were made using a Bingata pattern-style, traditional to Okinawa. These have repeated patterns of nature using primary colors of red, blue, yellow, green, and pink. The Alola starters, Pikachu, Raichu, and Oricorio fit both the pattern of colors, and island theme.</p><p>I think the biggest standouts to me were the transformable Rookidee figures which "evolve" into Corviknight, by Tsuboshima Yuuki <span class='ja'>坪島悠貴</span>. Obviously the size is off, but the proportions of both Pokemon are perfect, and coming up with a design to allow them to transform into each other is fascinating. The Pikachu forest, created by Sudou Reiko <span class='ja'>須藤玲子</span> was definitely the center piece of the room.

I liked her Moltres piece the most. Moltres appears by breaking out of an egg with flames. I think the other standouts in the room where all of the figures created by Ueba Kasumi, especially the Shaymin figure. </p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1170_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_pokemon/IMG_1295_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pokemon Kogei Catalogue</b></div><p>The best thing about every museum and museum exhibit in Japan is that the gift shop sells a book detailing each piece on display.

| March 30, 2023 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Along the Shou river and within the various Gasshou-style villages in southern Toyama prefecture, there is a restaurant that stands alone on the side of the road with a bear of its sign. Underneath, there's another sign that says <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>, or <I>Kuma-don</I>, or a Bear Bowl, which would be a bowl of rice with bear meat. Nearly 6 years ago, I saw this sign as teachers and I were going exploring on our way to Kanazawa. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1355_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is <b>Takachiyo</b>, a restaurant that serves dishes made from the meat of local wildlife.</p><p>While the sign is very noticeable, its location is very out-of-the-way. It's about halfway between Takayama and Toyama along the highway, but it's about 10 minutes away from the highway exit. Most people from Takayama don't take the highway when going to Toyama because Route 41 has no tolls and takes the same amount of time. Route 41 goes a completely different direction through the mountains, so it never connects to the highway.</p><p>Here's the location: <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9" title="https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9">https://goo.gl/maps/rMrJCJTr8JSQVviW9</a></p><p>Today, I went to Kanazawa, so on my return trip, I finally had the opportunity to visit the restaurant again.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1361_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides bear meat, the hunter that owns the restaurant, also traps deer and boar from the surrounding mountains. All of his dishes are prepared using local ingredients, including mountain vegetables, rice, and noodles. Soba noodles are hand-made from buckwheat grown by local people. </p><p>The menu mentions that killing animals for money is evil. However, we all live by consuming plants and animals. We must give thanks to them before each meal (and live together with them, in nature). This is the basic explanation of "Ittedakimasu," which is the 'grace' we all say before we eat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1365_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Five years ago, on my first visit to Takachiyo, I ordered their signature dish, the <span class='ja'>くま丼</span>. The bear meat was alright. It was tough and had a full taste, like beef. But, it also had a stringy-ness to it. Added with onions, eggs, and served on rice, it tasted delicious. </p><p>I went with some friends, and they ordered other dishes. One of my friends got some deer nabe. Nabe is a bit bowl of boiling broth with lots of vegetables and meat. It's similar to stew, but stew's main base is meat. Nabe's main base are the vegetables. Nabe is very weak in comparison. </p><p>The deer meat was alright. Japanese wild animals are much smaller compared with their American counterparts. They don't have gigantic bodies or gigantic muscles. As such, it didn't taste like venison I've had in the past. Again, more stringy.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230330_bear/IMG_1388_t.webp" /></a></p><p>For my meal today, I ordered a Boar Bowl and Boar Udon. Boar was the one animal I hadn't tried last time, so I wanted to complete the triangle. The boar meat in both dishes was rough, like a flank steak. The meat itself had a dry texture, even though it was submerged in the Udon broth.</p><p>Overall, I would say that if you planned on going here to try exotic meats, you may leave disappointed. However, you would not be disappointed with the actual meals. While the meats themselves were just okay, the rice bowls and udon tasted excellent. Very good. Just good enough that I would recommend going out of the way to try and visit at least once.</p><p>There are plenty more things available on the menu than what I've ordered so far. He had English menus available to take, so I scanned it. Also, I still had a Japanese menu from the first time I visited.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Lw6mF0HrQYN_gBHc9MDhQkoPgIfL4JF/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_jp.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15NTGQUMN1RD0nUQ8pbpfxWHcgamx_PF1/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20230331_takachiyo_en.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Aokigahara Forest, Mt.

On the northwest side of the mountain, the forest is called Aokigahara <span class='ja'>青木ヶ原</span>, which translate as the Blue Tree Meadow. It's also sometimes called the Sea of Trees. The forest had grown from the hardened lava rock of the last major eruption over 1000 years ago.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5527_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The forest has another name, too: the suicide forest.</p><p>Because of the magnetism from the lava rock, compasses often don't function correctly. And because of its remoteness, cellphone signal is sometimes disrupted. This often led to people hiking or wandering off in the forest and never being heard from again. This resulted in the local people considering the forest haunted. They would say that ghosts roam the forest and claim victims of anyone traveling alone.</p><p>By the mid-2000s, people started coming to the forest to get lost and die on purpose. In 2003, apparently 105 bodies were discovered in the forest. People would kill themselves by hanging or drug overdose. The forest was quite infamous for suicide because of this, and it was labeled the "most popular" place for suicide in Japan. Later in 2018, it would get even more acclaim when Logan Paul came here, and posted his video of finding a dead man hanged from a tree.</p><p>In order to prevent yourself from getting lost, hiking trails are lined with rope and markers to keep you on the trail and guide you back to the start. If you go off into the forest outside of the trail, you are supposed to bring your own flags to mark your trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5558_t.webp" /></a></p><p>My friends Fishy and Chaos came to visit me in Japan, and we went here as one of our last places on the vacation. We didn't bring any markers, but we also didn't really venture all that far into the forest. The forest was so huge, there really weren't any major trail heads. Everywhere looked identical.</p><p>As we drove along Route 71, eventually we found something that looked like a place to park and a cleared path into the woods.</p><p>I had a done a far amount of hiking in my 3 years of living in Takayama, but this forest had a much different atmosphere than those mountain woods. These forests don't really get a lot of snow or cold weather, so the moss and overgrowth completely covered anything on the ground. The trees shot up into the sky and created a near solid canopy that blocked out much of the sun. (As such, many of my photos are totally washed out.)</p><p>After moving into the forest far enough, it really did feel like an ocean of trees. Every direction felt the same. You could truly get lost without a sense of direction.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160731_fuji_forest/IMG_5599_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail we followed eventually led to a break in the canopy, and the sunlight shone down on a single carpet of grass.</p><p>We stayed for a moment, and then went back to the car. We found another trail down the road leading up into the mountain, but it had become late afternoon, and there was still a lot more driving left for the night.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Apr 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Ghibli Expo at Roppongi Hills" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/ghibli-expo-at-roppongi-hills">Ghibli Expo at Roppongi Hills</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Despite the Geneva Convention of 1925 banning the use of chemical weapons in war, it did not ban the development of storage of such weapons. Even so, the island was kept in complete secracy. Japan even removed the island from some of their official maps.</p><p>After the war, the facility was shut down and all research and products were destroyed. It wasn't until 1988, when the poison gas museum on the island was opened, was the island officially recognized as existing.</p><p>On the east end of the island, next to the dock for the ferry, there is the standing remains of the power plant used to power the poison gas facility.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160729_power_plant/IMG_5310_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Fishy, Chaos, and I stayed the night on <a href="/old/v7/bunny-island-okunoshima" title="/bunny-island-okunoshima">Okunoshima</a>, and toured the ruined building while waiting for the ferry.

The facility focused on developing a poison gas but it was never actually used in the war. During experimentation, bunnies were used to test the effectiveness of the gas.</p><p>After Japan surrendered in World War II, the facility was shut down, all records and products were destroyed, and the bunnies were set free on the island. Decades since, the bunnies have multiplied, and now hundreds of their descendants live on the island. Because of this, the island is often referred to as <b>Bunny Island</b>.</p><p>A hotel was builit on the island sometime in the 80s, so tourists can take a ferry from the mainland and stay overnight on the island.

The bomb almost completed leveled the city. This building was one of the few places whose remnants were still standing.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4652.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4652.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4652_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4652_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4652_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It was original called the Products Exhibition Hall, and it was located in the center of Hiroshima's large business distinct.  People used the hall to exhibit new art and educational products. One of the reasons much of the structure withstood the bombing was its combination steel and concrete construction. Many of the surrounding were not as reenforced as this one.</p><p>The hypocenter of the atomic bomb was nearly the same location. This was another reason why the structure still stood. The blast came from directly above only knocking out the interior floors and not the wall. The hypocenter itself was just around the corner on the side of the street.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4691.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4691_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4691_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4691_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I was really surprised how little reverance this location is given compared to the monument and park centered around the hypocenter in <a href="/old/v7/atomic-bomb-hypocenter" title="/atomic-bomb-hypocenter">Nagasaki.</a> The Hiroshima hypocenter just has a block of marble on the sidewalk with a plaque explaining it.</p><p><i>Carried to Hiroshima from Tinian Island by the Enola Gay, a U.S. Army B-29 Bomber, the first atomic bomb used in the history of humankind exploded approximately 600 meters above this spot. The city below was hit by heat rays of approximately 3,000 to 4,000 Celsius along with a blast wind and radiation. Most people in the area lost their lives instantly. The time was 8:15am, August 6th, 1945.</i></p><p>In 1945, when people started rebuilding Hiroshima, there were a lot of calls to tear down the remnants of the Products Exhibition Hall. But, there were just as many people who said it should stand as a symbol of peace and remembrance of the war. Those people won out, and with this symbol of peace, I suppose they didn't need to further extend a park to cover the hypocenter, especially when this location is in the middle of downtown.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4699.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4699.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4699_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4699_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160727_atomic_dome/IMG_4699_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Even in its current state, the building has withstood harsh weather from the occassional typhoon and various earthquakes, too. While it is a symbol or peace and remembrance, it is also a symbol of perseverance. Even becoming completely battered and destroyed, it still holds on.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Apr 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/4">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"><a href="/old/v7/travel/2">Next Entries »</a></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
