We are pretty deprived in America when it comes to deep cultural architectural artifacts as our nation's history is a mere 200 years old. While the Japanese people have been on that island ever since it disconnected itself from main Asia. Also, Japanese Castles wildly interest me as they're usually nestled into modern society.</p><p>Anyway, on our trip, <b>exactly one year ago</b>, Dave and I had the fortune of visiting two of Kyushu's standing castles: Kumamoto and Shimbara.  After our visit to Kagoshima in southern Kyushu, we traveled north on our way to Nagasaki.  As a waypoint, we stopped at Kumamoto for a night.  In the morning, we head took a ferry across the Shimabara sea to Shimabara, and ultimately Nagasaki.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto Castle</b></div><p>Unfortunately, we left Kagoshima much later than expected, and arrived in Kumamoto around 4pm.  We got to our hotel, checked in, and made our way to Kumamoto Castle.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp"  /></p><p>We arrived at Kumamoto Castle a bit after 5pm, and had less than an hour to explore this marvel.  So, we ran around the castle, and made our way to the top as fast as we could.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Here's a panoramic photo from the top: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7725_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7725_stitch.webp">Image!</a></p><p>It was a very pretty castle, and it's grounds were rather large, but we only had time to visit the castle itself.  We had barely gotten there, and had to leave already.  For the rest of the night we got some dinner, and went shopping for games and other things.  That story is detailed here: <a href="/old/v7/games-i-buy-ddr-edition" title="/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">Games I Buy: DDR Edition</a></p><div class='title'><b>Shimabara Castle</b></div><p>In the morning, we made way to Kumamoto Port, and sailed across the Shimabara Sea to Nagasaki Prefecture.  It was somewhat foggy out that day.  It felt like we were sailing into the unknown.  We left the port behind, and eventually it faded away into the gray void.</p><p>Dave and I basically relaxed on our voyage.  I don't really remember doing anything special.  Eventually, land started coming into view from a far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp"  /></p><p>It was the port of Shimabara, totalled overshadowed by Mt. Fugen.  Mt. Fugen and the Unzen resort nearby was our first field trip when studying abroad.  We spent the day climbing to the top, which gave a great view of the volcano festering along side it.  Here's pictures from back then: <a href="/old/v7/i-climbed-another-mountain" title="/i-climbed-another-mountain">Images!</a></p><p>Anyway, our ferry sailed parallel to the harbor for a while and finally docked.  Dave and I exited the craft and walked to the nearest train station.  20 minutes later our train arrived, and we got off at the castle grounds.  We walked up the hill, and were met with the icon of Shimabara.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7808_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7808_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7808_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7826.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7826.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7826.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7827.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7827.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7827.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7907.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7907.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7910.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7910.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7910.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7916.webp"  /></p><p>We went inside, and climbed the stairs to the top.

One weekend when studying abroad, a fellow JASIN student, Brian, and I took a Saturday and rode the train out here.  The castle hadn't changed one bit in the last 4 years.  The entire compound was basically trapped in time.  It suffered no degredation due to the upkeep of its staff.  Likewise, it had not evolved or iterated in its years either.  It was a relic frozen in time.  Which makes sense...  It's a historic monument.  They aren't going to build any new wings of the fortress.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto v. Shimabara</b></div><p>The difference between Kumamoto and Shimabara are quite clear.  First off, Kumamoto is the capitol of Kumamoto Prefecture.  It's an actual city, rather than a rural village.  It's the center of all of Kyushu, and has thousands of people through its area everyday.  It has more cash flowing through it, therefore it's castle is more expansive, complex, and vast.</p><p>Shimbara is a simple town with a simple castle.  It has a single structural point that continues to the sky, rather than multiple wings.

| May 18, 2011 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>As a game collector, you eventually come across a game that you simply cannot find.  A game that's not necessary rare, but uncommon.  The only distinction between the two being demand.  This particular game for me is (was) Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.</p><p>DDR Party Collection was released in Dec 2003 as a follow-up and compliment to DDR Extreme.  The arcade version of DDR Extreme had so many songs that the home release couldn't contain them all and they released two games.  DDR Extreme had all the new original songs, plus some favorites.  While DDR Party Collection contained the bulk of the favorites and classics they couldn't pack into DDR Extreme.  It used the exact same engine as DDR Extreme, and had just as many songs!</p><p>We played this game a few times at DDR Nights in college, as Tony had a ROM copy, but I wished someday to own a legitimate copy.   Throughout my Study Abroad in Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  Throughout my yearly vacations to Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  I eventually gave up and decided to buy a copy off ebay, but they were no longer listed!  No one was selling.</p><p>It was <b>one year ago yesterday</b> that I finally found a copy.  My 6 year long quest had finally come to its end in Kumamoto.  And it was a fated encounter...</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto</b></div><p>After Dave and I visited Kagoshima, we traveled North to Kumamoto.  Kumamoto is Kyushu's central prefecture, and it's focal point is the gigantic castle in the dead center of town.  Dave and I were able to visit the castle, but only 30-40 minutes before it closed.  Afterward, we wondered what to do.</p><p>On my map, I had one location written down which was a Geo (video game store) not too far east of the Capitol.  We ventured down the castle hill, and made it to the train station.  We passed some delicious looking restaurants on the way there, but wanted to ensure we got on the train.  When we got to the train station, the train wasn't scheduled to arrive for another 20 or 30 minutes, so we backtracked to this interesting hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</p><div class='title'><b>Choboiyaki</b></div><p>This restaurant served Okonomiyaki, but it's not the type you would expect.  It was definitely prepared in a similar manner, but the pancake was HUGE.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp"  /></p><p>The radius of this pancake is about as large as the diameter should be.  She piled on the cabbage, and smashed it all down into form.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp"  /></p><p>The pancake was flipped over, folded, and cut up into servable pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp"  /></p><p>And like all Okonomiyaki, it was absolutely delicious.  Between her semi-decent english and my horrible Japanese, we were able to talk a little bit about what she was actually making...</p><p>Japan may look somewhat small, especially compared to the United States, but it is incredibly diverse.  As a country, Japan grew from isolation, and that isolation spread to its culture, and it culture is known for taking elements of other culture, assimilating them, and expanding on them.  So you get plenty of local cultural traits you won't find anywhere else.  And this especially applies to food.</p><p>This particular version of Okonomiyaki is only local to Kumamoto and is known as Choboiyaki.  At least I think that's what she said.  Here's a pic of the menu with the name on it: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp">Image!</a>.  Maybe it's just Choboyaki...  or Chobomiyaki, except the 'ya' fire kanji immediately follows 'chobo'.  I dunno...</p><div class='title'><b>Off to Geo</b></div><p>That stuff was delicious and unique, but it's off to the game store to kill time.  I'm sure Dave was somewhat bored with my over-attentive scrutiny of searching every single game they owned, so I didn't go through absolutely everything.  I searched PS2 games and found nothing.  I skimmed PS1, skimmed Saturn, searched Dreamcast, and that was pretty much it.  I couldn't quit find the Rhythm game section for PS2, but didn't want to bore Dave that much more.</p><p>Though, on my way out, Beatmania caught my eye.  "Hold on a second.." I said as I crotched down to take a look, and HOLY CRAP!  What do you know!  It just so happened that they had a copy of DDR Party Collection on the shelf.  I was pretty surprised, as I had never seen this game in the wild.  Though, I didn't get my hopes completely up, as in the past, I happened across a game on the shelf, and they ultimated didn't actually have it in stock.</p><p>I took the case to the counter as my only purchase.  They went around the corner to search through their PS2 games, and didn't seem to immediately find it.  The two girls came back to the counter to take a look at the case again and noticed something they had missed on first glance.  They went to the back and came back with this:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp"  /></p><p>Exclamation point!  Not only did they have a copy of the game, they had the limited edition release of the game that came with a dance pad, complete with bucket.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp"  /></p><p>I looked closer at the sales label (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp">pictured here</a>), and it had the sale date as Dec 11th, 2003.  Not only did they have this in their possesion, but it's been since RELEASE DAY!  It had waited for 6 1/2 years collecting dust and being constantly passed up but patrons until I came through the doors.  One of the games I've been searching for 6 years, and I found a release copy NEW.</p><p>This is fate.  I immediately bought it.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a bucket of DDR turned into a slight difficulty considering Dave and I packed VERY lightly for our trip.  I had no room for this thing in my luggage.  But how could I not keep this thing that I was destined to own!</p><p>Well, I don't need the crappy DDR pad.  So, I threw that in the trash.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp"  /></p><p>I stuff the bucket full of my dirty clothes</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp"  /></p><p>And doing so gave me plenty of room to store in my luggage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp"  /></p><p>Perfect!</p><p>And so my quest ends.  The game that took me the longest time to find was finally found.  (Actually, I guess that's not true, as I've been searching for a copy of Snatcher on Sega CD since the late 90s.)  With DDR Party in hand, my PS2 DDR Collection is complete.  I have all the games I want. ^_^<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Visiting Fukuoka 福岡" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/visiting-fukuoka">Visiting Fukuoka 福岡</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm totally excited, but the day's traveling has worn that down a little bit.  It's not until my batteries are fully recharged that my energy empowers my excitement.  That first morning back in Japan is like Christmas as a Child.</p><p>I want to do everything!  And my first destination was Tokyo Tower, which is its own symbol of regeneration.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3138.webp"  /></p><p>After World War II, Japan was a defeated nation.  They were down, but not out.  Everyone in the nation pulled together to rebuild Japan.  Japan flourished once again.</p><p>In 1953, NHK began broadcasting for the first time.  But the signal was too weak for the entire Kanto region to receive its signals.  It was clear that a large transmission tower would be needed to boost the signal, or else moderately sized ones would choke Tokyo.</p><p>They called upon Tachu Naito to architect such a tower.  He chose the France's Eiffel Tower as a starting point, and designed a structure so secure that it could withstand an Earthquake twice the strength of the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake (8.3 on the Richter Scale) and typhoons with wind speeds up to 140 miles an hour.</p><p>When completed it stood 30 meters taller than the Eiffel Tower.  It became a symbol for Japan.  A monument to their efforts to rebuild Japan and their growing economic power.</p><p>Thank you, Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Tower</a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3147.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090502_japan/IMG_3151.webp"  /></p><p>Tokyo Tower has 2 observatory decks.

| May 30, 2009 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><div class='title'><b>This story begins on eBay.</b></div><p>Since October last year, I've begun selling a lot of my collectibles because I really haven't gotten anything out them.  I bought a whole lot of figures from McFarlane toys, and they've done nothing but sit in my parent's attic for nearly 10 years.  So, I put them on ebay.  Some of them sold quite fast, but others lingered for quite a long time.</p><p>Fast forward to March this year.  I've already purchased airfare for the first couple days in May to visit Tokyo, Japan.  I get an email from an ebay user wondering if I'd ship something of mine to Tokyo.  The light bulb immediately flashes in my head, and I start writing the reply,</p><p>"Yeah, I could ship to Tokyo but it'll be about $30 or $40 extra.  As it so happens, I'll be in Tokyo at the beginning of May.  If you wouldn't mind waiting 2 months, I could deliver the figure in person free of charge. ^_^  What do you say?"</p><p>Initially, the user was taken back by this.  "What?  I don't even know you," his first reply began with.  But once I proved the depths of my Anime nerdom, he agreed to meet.  He introduced himself as Akira. ^_^  I asked him for suggestions of places I should visit while in Japan and he mentioned to Ghibli Museum.  There's a Ghibli Museum?!  Damn straight I'm going there.</p><div class='title'><b>Planning a trip to the Ghibli Museum</b></div><p>Thankfully, Akira mentioned that buying tickets for the Ghibli Museum is not straightforward.  You can't buy the tickets at the Museum.  In Japan, you must buy tickets at a Lawsons convenience store.  The ticket is for a specific day with entrance at a specific time of that day.  For non-Japanese residents, you must buy your tickets through JTB Travel Agency.</p><p>We choose a day, May 3rd, and bought our tickets without a problem.  Our tickets were for 2pm, so we planned to meet up ahead of time.  We could go to Shinjuku or wherever and hang out.  Eventually, we'll make our way down to Mitaka Station and take the bus to the Ghibli Museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Hanging Out before hand</b></div><p>Thank god for my Japanese Cell Phone.  There's no way we would've found each other had he not been able to call me and talk.  We met in near the East entrance of Shinjuku Station.  And we just walked around to various stores and arcades in the area,  chatted about Anime and Games.  What I liked, What he liked.  General bullshit like that.</p><p>We hopped on a train and went over to Nakano to visit the very first Mandarake store.  The Nakano Mandarake was absolutely massive.  It was 3 floors with each floor was about the size of a mall.  This Mandarake was segmented into many different stores that specialized in each tiny niche of otaku fandom.</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3304.webp" /></p><p>There was a store for costumes, one for retro games, one for newer game, one for new games, artbooks, design books, animation cells, figures, statues, gashapon, old music, game music, foreign music, anime, movies, foreign movies...  the list goes on and on.  This is where I found Ikaruga Used for $36.  I also found a few <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3302.webp">copies</a> of <a

Mandarake is also where I found more Super Mario Bros. sound drops.</p><p>As time crept closer to 2pm, we left Mandarake, hopped on a train and headed for Mitaka.  We got to the Museum right on time and met up with Akira's wife, Natsuki, outside. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Museum</b></div><p class='img'><img

heavily wooded park, the organic domes and vine covered walls made a perfect home.</p><p class='img'><img

the museum was very nice.  Each part of the museum was a separate room that you'd enter from the center of the building.  The first room had animated statues of Ghilbi characters that displayed how the animation process works.</p><p>Also on the first floor, was a theater that played an original production only available to see at the Museum.  They have 6 or 7 different original 15-minute films that rotate month after month.  For May, they were playing "Mei to Koneko Bus" (english: "Mei and the Koneko Bus").  Which featured Mei from Totoro who captured a Kitty Bus, and then go off in the woods with it and meets a bunch of Totoros.  It was really cute. ^_^</p><p>After the film, we went on the roof to see the Laputa Garden.  When reaching the roof, you're immediately greeted by a Laputa Giant.  Akira and I stood next to it for a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3315.webp" /></p><p>The path continued along the back to reveal a Laputa stone.</p><p

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3314.webp" /></p><p>There were other spiffy areas in the museum, too.  Like a life-sized Cat Bus for the kids to hop around on.  There was also an area that served as a replica to Miyazaki's workbench from when he began Ghibli films.  All along the walls were original sketches and storyboards for his works throughout the years.</p><p>There was the gift shop too!  I bought a design book that has many storyboards from Ghibli films throughout the years.  I bought some stickers for my suitcase.  And, I bought some other things to give as gifts for people. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Afterwards..</b></div><p>After leaving the Ghibli Museum, we walked through the park towards the Kichijoji train station.  Mitaka is a beatiful area.  Perfect for letting children run around outside in a nice wooded area, rather than the cool concrete of the Tokyo streets.  Before we parted ways, we went to Dinner at a Sushi restaurant underneath Kichijoji station.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" loading="lazy"

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3321.webp" /></p><p>This was one of those Sushi restaurant that had a conveyer belt running through the restaurant.  When something came by your table that looked delicious you'd take it from the line and it's yours!  The color and design of the plate designated the price you'd pay for eating it.  Prices ranged from 75 cents a plate to $6.  My favorite sushi were in the $1.50, $2 range, so I was fine. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img

title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090503_japan/IMG_3319.webp" /></p><p>They had the best California Rolls I've ever eaten.  The avacado was crisp and cool, next to the tender soft crab meat wrapped around delicious rice topped with some mayonaise and tuna eggs.  (at least, I think those are tuna eggs.)</p><p>Delicious!  But I still prefer 100 yen Sushi in Nagasaki. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Bon Voyage..</b></div><p>Meeting Akira and Natsuki was amazing and definitely the highlight of my trip.  The Language difference wasn't too great.  They were much better at English than I was at Japanese.  But we were able to go back and forth between the 2 to figure out what we were trying to say.  Hopefully, my Japanese will be better next time I'm in Tokyo so we can have better conversations!</p><p>If you buy or sell stuff on ebay, I think it's definitely worth your while to meet up with people if you have the chance.  Whatever you're buying or selling is a great place to start a conversation.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/10">« Previous Entries</a></div><div
