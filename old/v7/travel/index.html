Many of the homes look pretty modern and maintained.</p><p>Up until a few years ago, the building of the former branch school was still standing in town. This was the Toga Elementary Kamimomose Branch School <span class='ja'>利賀小学校上百瀬分校</span>. Like many of the other branch schools in the area, it was probably still in use until 1996, and then closed for good.</p><p>The building still stood for 25 years, but no one maintained it, so it began falling apart and became a health hazard because of asbestos. Looking through Google Maps and Google Earth, it was demolished sometime between November 2021 and October 2023.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_11_kamimomose/IMG_1569_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Today, the gymansium still stands, but it has been completely gutted.

The site of the village is along the Toga River going south up the mountain from Sakaue village. It's between the villages of Abetto and Taikanba.</p><p>A branch school was opened in the village for its children. In 1959, there were 16 students. But the school was closed 6 years later. Perhaps this was because many of the younger families moved away or because a bus service could be established between the village in Sakaue village nearby. The concrete branch schools in the area were built in the 1970s, so this building would've been made out of wood.</p><p>In 2013, <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=134">Hayaneko</a> visited the village and only 2 houses remained, with one of the houses actually being lived in. Today, all traces of those homes have been removed for some kind of fancy French restaurant and rental cabins.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1353_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking in, it reminded me a lot of the restaurant from The Menu. Apparently meals are more than 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> a plate.</p><p>The side road continues past the restaurant into the forest, and eventually ends with the forest engulfing the road. I wasn't paying attention to the map, so I didn't realize that I went past the shrine quite a while ago. Going back to the restaurant, the shrine is located up on the hill behind the area. You can see it from the road peering through the trees.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_08_tanoshima/IMG_1351_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Shinmei Shrines <span class='ja'>神明宮</span> are Shinto shrines devoted to Amaterasu, the goddess of the sun. In Japanese mythology, Amaterasu was responsible for the origin of agriculture in Japan, so Amaterasu is widely worshipped in areas were agriculture is most important.</p><p>Throughout Toga Valley and many rural areas, it's pretty easy to find Shinmei Shrines, as their yearly festivals pray to the gods for an abundant harvest.</p><p>With no one left in the village, I'm not really sure who maintains this shrine. Inside the shrine, a plaque showing the names of all the Shinto priests lies on its side, and hasn't been updated in years. Perhaps the folks running the restaurant keep up the old rituals.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Senzoku Branch School 千束分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/senzoku-branch-school">Senzoku Branch School 千束分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 28, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>When I explored Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span> in early June this year, I learned about how the mountain pass was a pivotal connection point of the mountain villages of southwest Toyama to the urban areas of the north. One important part of this history was the postal service. </p><p>Until 1970, especially in the winter, because of the large amounts of winter mountain snow, mail was still carried by hand. Carriers of Johana Town would bring the mail to the Hosoo Postal Exchange where they would meet carriers from Taira Village. Both teams left at 9am and met around 1pm. They would exchange their packages and letters. Then, they'd go back down the mountain to their post offices. These folks were known as the Postal Corps <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span>.</p><p>The <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office</a> <span class='ja'>細尾峠郵便交換所</span> was one of the places I visited when I explored Hosoo Pass. I went there on June 3rd. It turns out that just a days prior on May 31st, they held a dedication ceremony for the creation of a monument devoted to the Taira Postal Corps in Taira Village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the Postal Corps and includes 3 photos taken in the 1960s. There are a few individual credits on the back of the monument. The <span class='ja'>郵送隊之碑</span> calligraphy was done by Fumio Yamamoto <span class='ja'>山本文雄</span>. And the 3 photos were taken by Toshio Takada <span class='ja'>高田</span> <span class='ja'>俊夫</span>, Shinobu Soga <span class='ja'>曽我忍</span>, and Tsutomu Takada <span class='ja'>高田勉</span>.</p><p>The May 31st ceremoney was held by the mayor, the chairs of the commeration committee, and Shinobu Soga, one of the men who took a photo of the Postal Corps. The Yomiuri Newspaper wrote <a href="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/" title="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/">an article about it</a>. In the article, it mentions how Soga was a location scout for a film studio in Kyoto and came to Gokayama looking for locations. He learned of the Postal Corps and wanted to travel with them and learn more.</p><p>In the end, he could get some amazing unique photos of the team. Of the three photos on the monument, I think this one was his.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the other photos shows the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office in the 60s in winter. Having been there a few weeks prior, they apparently made an addition to the building sometime in the 60s. The plaque in the Postal Exchange Office mentioned that mail increased significantly in the 60s because of economic reform. The Postal Corps chain would somtimes include up to 30 members. So, I suppose they needed the extra space for the package exchange.</p><p>Here's a <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information">transcription and translation</a> of the plaque at the Postal Exchange office in the woods in the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plaque on the monument gives a brief history of the Postal Corps. Here's a transcription and translation of the contents:</p><p><span class='ja'>かって、冬期間積雪により交通機関が断され</span> <span class='ja'>陸の孤島と化していた越中五箇山の人々に</span> <span class='ja'>文化の火をもたらす役割を果たたのが</span> <span class='ja'>郵便遞送隊</span>(<span class='ja'>通称</span> <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span>)<span class='ja'>でした。</span> <span class='ja'>当時、平・城端両郵便局では請負人を雇用隊を編成して標高七四〇</span>m<span class='ja'>の細尾峠近くに設けられた郵便交換所まで背負って運び渡していました。</span></p><p>The Postal Transport Corps (commonly known as the Postal Corps) played a role in bringing a firey culture to the people of Etchu Gokayama, who were once isolated village islands in the winter when transportation was cut off due to snowfall. At that time, the Taira and Johana Post Offices organized contractors into teams to carry mail on their backs to the postal exchange office located near Hosoo Pass, 740 meters above sea level.</p><p><span class='ja'>明治十五年下梨郵便局</span>(<span class='ja'>現平局</span>)<span class='ja'>開設されて以来、城端局と片道約二〇</span>km<span class='ja'>の峠山道を徒歩で往復していました。昭和十年長い間続いた直送を廃し、両局の中程に位置する細尾峠で郵袋を交換する方法なりました。その後、バスの開通に伴い通常期はバス託送に改め、昭和三十年から請負による交換便は冬期に限られることになりました。深雪・吹雪の中隊員苦労は想像を絶するものでした。</span></p><p>Since Shimonashi Post Office (now Taira Post Office) was opened in 1882, mail was sent back and forth between Johana Post Office on foot along the mountain pass, about 20km one-way**. In 1935, the long-running direct delivery system was discontinued, as the method of mail exchange was changed to bus delivery at Hosoo Pass, located between the two offices. After that, the normal period was changed to bus delivery, and from 1955, the contracted exchange service was limited to winter. The hardships faced by the members of the Postal Corps in the deep snow and blizzards were unimaginable.</p><p>(**note: The monument says one-way, but it's only 10 km one-way. It's 20 km round trip.)</p><p><span class='ja'>時代と共に、請負人の雇用難・雪崩危険等に鑑み、昭和四十五年八十八年間に渡る郵送隊のの歴史を閉じました。その後冬期は庄川の船便等を利用する輸送となり昭和五十九年</span>,<span class='ja'>国道三〇四号線に五箇山トンネルが開通したことにより、専用自動車便が通年運行され、現在に至っています。</span></p><p>As times changed, the Postal Corps came to an end after 88 years of operation in 1970, due to the difficulty of finding contractors and the risk of avalanches. After that, transportation in the winter was changed to ship services on the Shogawa River. In 1984, the Gokayama Tunnel was opened on National Route 304, and dedicated automobile services began to operate year-round, which continues to this day.</p><p><span class='ja'>郵送隊の大きな功績は</span><br/>The Great Achievements of the Postal Corps</p><p><span class='ja'>・厳冬の雪深い峠道を人力で郵便物</span>(<span class='ja'>生活必需品</span>)<span class='ja'>を運び地域住民の暮らしを支えた。</span><br/>- They carried mail (a daily necessity) by hand through snowy mountain passes in the harsh winter, supporting the lives of local residents.</p><p><span class='ja'>・隊員の大半は主婦で女性の忍耐と献身性が特筆される。</span><br/>- Most of the members were housewives, and the perserverance and dedication of women is particulary noteworthy.</p><p><span class='ja'>・郵便局では</span> <span class='ja'>地域への奉仕・貢献の原点として語り継がれている。</span><br/>- At the post office, it is passed down as the origin of service and contribution to the community.</p><p><span class='ja'>ここにその功績を称え</span> <span class='ja'>史実を後世に伝えるものです。</span><br/>Here, we commemorate their achievements and pass on the historical facts to future generations.</p><p><span class='ja'>令和七年五月</span> - May 2025<br/><span class='ja'>郵送隊を称える会</span> - The Postal Corps Commemoration Committee</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument is a great way of commemorating such a unique service in the area.

| June 28, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Located in a small valley between the two major mountain passes of travel connecting the urban areas of Tonami <span class='ja'>砺波町</span> and Johana Town <span class='ja'>城端町</span> to the large village of Shimonashi <span class='ja'>下梨村</span> (modern day Taira <span class='ja'>平村</span>), was the village of Nashitani <span class='ja'>梨谷村</span>. Today, what remains of the village is slightly hidden behind the Taira Ski Resort and Restaurant Maple.</p><p>There are several houses in the village still standing, and some of the homes seem like they've had some recently maintenance work done of them. According to some online research done by <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html">Mr. Murakage</a>, there were people living in some homes until 1982. Although, even though it doesn't seem like anyone is living here today, the families still come back to check on the houses. He and <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123">Hayaneko</a> visited in 2011 and found no one there, and neither did I during my visit.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0539_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When parking at the Taira Ski Resort, you can see the village poking through the area behind Restaurant Maple. The restaurant seems like its open every day to cater to the construction workers up in the mountains doing whatever work they do. I arrived before the opening time, and the people working at the restaurant were preparing for the day.</p><p>The road to the village loops behind the restaurant and goes up the hill. You walk past a grave and some monuments. The monuments were too withered away to fully understand them. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0551.webp">The grave</a> was marked as Hotouge Family <span class='ja'>朴峠家</span>. <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Taira_Nashitani.html">Murakage-san</a> was able to research the names of the 28 homes that used to be in the village, and he listed them on his page. The Hotouge Family apparently moved to Osaka in the 1960s.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0554_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Still standing in the main area of the village were three homes, and a few sheds and garages. The first home was owned by the Yamazaki Family <span class='ja'>山崎家</span>. The next home was owned by the Higashi Family <span class='ja'>東家</span>. The Higashi Family had <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0742.webp">a grave</a> behind their house, but there was no Yamazaki grave. There was a foundation for a small building behind there, too.</p><p>All the homes in the area their windows boarded up, and occassionally some extra supports along the outsides. This was mainly to prevent any structural or internal damage happening from excessive snow and snow melt in the winter. As such, the only access to the homes were the front doors, which were all locked.</p><p>There was one more home in this small neighborhood cluster. Rather than wooden supports and protection, it was covered in aluminum siding, which was probably installed in the last 20 years. The whole home seemed like it was perfectly preserved inside its metal shell. Out back, there was a family grave, but I don't remember the name. If I were to guess, it was probably Tsujimoto <span class='ja'>辻本</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0763_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the middle of this neighborhood cluster was the village's temple. The door was open, so I went inside to take a look. It seemed like it was pretty well taken care of for a building that was probably over 100 years old.</p><p>The temple included a shrine behind the folding walls, but covering the inside walls of the temple were names and names and names of everyone who was a member of the shrine. Every little bit of upper wall space was covered in thin wooden planks, each denoting a single person's membership. The planks didn't have any dates, but according to Murakage's page, the history of the village went back further than the  Meiji period. Many of the names matched Murakage's listing of famliies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0775_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking through my photos, this white plaque was the most recent dated Heisei 10 or 1997 <span class='ja'>平成十年吉日</span>. The title says <span class='ja'>梨谷村道場修繕工事一式</span>, which seems to translate as Nashitani Village Dojo Repair Work Company All Members. And then it lists 66 members, and an additional 3 executive members <span class='ja'>実行委員</span>. The 3 executive members are Nakai <span class='ja'>中井</span>, Yamazaki <span class='ja'>山崎</span>, and Arai <span class='ja'>荒井</span>. In fact, there are many planks throughout the temple (or dojo?) of the Yamazaki family. Maybe their family were the mayors of the village.</p><p>So, so far, we've seen the Yamazaki Home, Higashi Home, village Temple or Dojo, and Tsujimoto Home. Behind the Tsujimoto home were storage building that were half torn apart and perhaps a few more winters away from complete collapse. The road continued past this cluster, which revealed the Nakai Home <span class='ja'>中井家</span>  on the bend of the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0839_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There was a walkway going past the Nakai Home into some farm fields and a storage shed was some equipment that was probably still used 10 years ago. Next to the storage shed was the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0858.webp">family grave</a> for the Uji Family <span class='ja'>宇治家</span>.</p><p>This small area felt very classic country, like the Shire in Lord of the Rings. A wavy stone path with a stone wall connecting homes to homes with circular plots of fields for whatever they grew.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0860_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Returning to the Nakai Home, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0846.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0846.webp">their family grave</a> was out front, too. It's important to note that all of these graves were very clean, recognizable, and had recent flowers placed on them. It would seem like these families, whether the original residents are still alive living elsewhere or their descendants, still return here after winter to maintain the houses and the graves. Actually, a whole field of grass near the Nakai home showed signs of it being mowed in the last few weeks.</p><p>Nashitani Village is abandoned in that no one lives here, but it's not so abandoned that people haven't forgotten about it.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0874_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In fact, the final home in the area, the Kuribayashi Home <span class='ja'>栗林</span>, had quite a lot of recent repair work done on the front, including a new door with its <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0876.webp">wrapping</a> still on.</p><p>Murakage's page again lists all the families living in the village since the Meiji period, and only 5 families were still living in Nashitani by 1982 (Showa 57). Those 5 families were Yamazaki, Higashi, Tsujimoto, Arai, and Nakai. The Arai family married into the Yamazaki family. There was also the maintained grave for the Uji family. They apparently only moved to Johana, a mere 10km away.</p><p>The Kuribayashi family, though... Murakage lists them as having moved to either Kyoto or Hokkaido in the 60s. I wonder whose been fixing up their home.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0743_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Those 5 main homes and the temple, plus a garage and a few other storage buildings were all that I could find in the area. Apparently, there's another home further up the Nashitani river.</p><p>Murakage-san visited Nashitani with another abandoned village researched named <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=123">Hayaneko</a>. He does a lot of research of these village by looking up old schools, specifically branch schools. Branch schools are extensions of the main school in the area that cater specifically to the residents of remote villages. It's often too often and too dangerous to have the kids travel to school each day, so a local school was built and a teacher lives at the school during the week or sometimes for the whole winter.</p><p>Out here, the school was named Taira Village Shimonashi Elementary School - Nashitani Branch School <span class='ja'>平村立下梨小学校梨谷分校</span>. According to his research, the school was classified as a Grade 3 Remote School and had 24 students in 1959 (Showa 34). It was apparently built in 1902 (Meiji 35). According ot Wikipedia, the branch school was officially closed in 1971.</p><p>Any elementary students left in the area went to Shimonashi Elementary School after the branch school closed, which became much easier in 1973 with the completion of the Nashitani Tunnel in 1973. </p><p>Later in 1999, the two elementary schools in the area, Shimonashi Elementary and Higashi Nakae Elementary both closed when Taira Elementary School was established. Not much later, in 2004 during the phase of rural municipal mergers across Japan, the whole southwestern area of Toyama became Nanto City. In 2006, elementary school students now went to Kamitaira Elementary School,  </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0797_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I feel like the graves and the temple are the most interesting part of this village. According to Google Maps, the name of the temple of the Nashitani Nembutsu Dojo <span class='ja'>梨谷念仏道場</span>. Apparently, Nembutsu is a specific sect of Buddhist spread a priest named Rennyo <span class='ja'>蓮如上人</span> who lived in the Gokayama mountains. He began preaching about Joho Shinshu during the Muromachi period and gained many followers in the mountain and in Nanto Town.</p><p>During the Edo Period, he was able to build temples in many of the small mountain villages for the locals to practice the religion. The temple were apparently unique in that they were as large as a normal homes, and priests could live in them. Looking back through some names, the priest of Nashitani may have been named Anchi <span class='ja'>安地</span>.</p><p>Each one of the graves is nearly identical with the exception of the famliy's name. The top reads <span class='ja'>南無阿弥陀佛</span> or Namuamida Hotoke. Namuamida is Buddha. Hotoke, I think, means statue or monument. Maybe it doesn't mean grave after all...  But, I think these monuments were still erected to pay respects to the families of the past 200 years. Weird that I never saw the Yamazaki one.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_02_nashitani/IMG_0548_t.webp" /></a></p><p>While it does feel like the many pockets of society dotted throughout the Gokayama mountains have been slowly reclaimed by nature, I'm actually surprised how much information I could find out about this one.

After Ueda Village, there was nothing but the road, the trees, and the climb. Many of the residents made their living catering to these travelers, or by working as porters themselves.</p><p>At the top of the first mountain was <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span></a>, which I wrote about before. The Hosoo Pass and the area is well known for its Postal Corps, a group of housewives and local people employed by the postal service who would cross the mountain every day during winter to deliver the mail. When descending from the pass from the other side, you'd reach <a href="/old/v7/abandoned-nashitani-village" title="/abandoned-nashitani-village">Nashitani Village <span class='ja'>梨谷村</span></a> and then after going over Ose Pass, you'd reach Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> and Shinonashi Village <span class='ja'>下梨村</span>.</p><p>After the war, Japan began to rebuild and became an economic icon. They invested a lot of money into infrastructure, making many of the remote areas more accessible. The Gokayama Highway became Route 304, and as transportation also became stronger, fewer and fewer people were stopping at Ueda before going up the mountain. In 1970, a new Route 304 was established, and now no one traveled through Ueda.</p><p>In 1973, the remaining residents of the Ueda Village all moved away together to the Rikyu area of Johana Town, leaving what was left of their homes to be reclaimed by the forest.</p><p>In 2009, a monument was erected in remembrance of the old village. I put a <a href="/old/v7/ueda-village-translation" title="/ueda-village-translation">transcription and translation</a> of that monument in another post, so you can view the information directly.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0425_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the village with its credits listed on the back of the monument. On the larger stone monument, a town map has been enshrined. It lists 35 households from 1945 (Showa 20). From research done <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html">Kage-kan</a>, Ueda village had 30 homes with 174 people in 1872. The number of homes may have peaked in 1930 with 42 homes. As mentioned above, it was 35 homes in 1945. Kage-kan says 22 homes in 1946. And only 8 homes in 1948.</p><p>Apparently when Kage-kan and Hayaneko visited the area in 2011, there were still some wooden remains of a few houses. Today, I couldn't any trace of homes other than some stone foundations and a few bridges that crossed the steam and went no where.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0418_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking at the town map again, there are a lot of side roads branching off of old Route 304. The map shows a shrine off in a direction, so I wondered if there were still any traces of that left. Usually people still attend to shrines long after the area is desserted. (Of course, I wasn't able to sight-read the monument, so I didn't know the shrine had folded and its diety moved into town.)</p><p>Across the street from the monument, it did look like there was a path leading into the forest. It was heavily overgrown, but my legs were completely wrapped up and I had my work gloves. I could power through it if the path continued to be noticeable enough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0476_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Tearing through vines and overgrowth wasn't that bad, and the path continued to lead to a raised clearing which must've been a foundation for a home. So, I figured that I must have been going the right way. Although, looking at the map, it was clearly not. The path to the shrine went up a bit, so I continued up, but the ground was too muddy and unstable. I stepped on the ground, and my foot sunk into a mud hole. Meh, I'm going back. It's probably better to try and run through the woods in fall after the growth has died down.</p><p>I got back in my car and continued driving south going up the mountain. Along the road were several dumping pits for concrete rubble. Further up the road was a construction site for machinery milling out parts of the mountain to create concrete and concrete blocks used for road construction and such.</p><p>The road twisted back on itself and sharply shot up the mountain to reach the current Route 304.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0526_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At the top of the junction, you could look back down and see just how thick the forests were after so much rain and sun in May and June. Way up in the left corner of that photo, you can see <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass <span class='ja'>細尾峠</span></a>, the ultimate destination of all the porters who lived in Ueda Village when they transported things to Gokayama. By continuing up the new Route 304 (new as of 1970), you'll reach the destination of the porters.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0378_t.webp" /></a></p><p>By the way, finding the Ueda (Futatsuya) Village monument took a little bit of research. I had found those webpages of <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko</a> and <a href="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html" title="http://www.aikis.or.jp/~kage-kan/16.Toyama/Johana_Ueda.html">Kage-kan</a> going to the village in 2011, but it's not marked on the map, and both reports don't actually say where it is. I had a general idea where it was, though, given the location of Hosoo Pass. And just north of Hosoo Pass was Futatsuya River following north into Johana. It had to be along there, but I didn't really have confirmation.</p><p>What I was really looking for was the first image in <a href="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122" title="https://heyaneko.jugem.jp/?eid=122">Hayaneko's Post</a>. There was an old road sign pointing to Ueda two kilometers ahead. This had to be somewhere in southern Johana. I poked around a lot Google Map Street View, and I finally found it. This is at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z" title="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.4842751,136.8923234,20z">36°29'03.5"N 136°53'32.4"E</a>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/google-maps-2025-06-05.webp" /></a></p><p>Street View had an entry for 2021 and 2012, both of which had the sign removed from its posts. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0388.webp"/>When I arrived at the location</a>, the posts were no longer in the ground. There was some debris nearby, some piles of loose lumber, possibly from a demolished shed. I found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0369.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0369.webp">an old bus stop sign</a> partially buried in the ground.</p><p>On the way back to my car, I looked over at the shed with metal siding and saw the sign, continuing to rust and decay.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_01_ueda/IMG_0385_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Gifu was still visible, but both towns of Ueda <span class='ja'>上田</span> and Shimonashi <span class='ja'>下梨</span> had decayed.

Shimonashi was the main village along river, and Nashitani was futher up the mountain between Ose Pass and Hosoo Pass.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hosoo Pass 細尾峠 &amp; Postal Station Ruins 郵便交換所" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass 細尾峠 &amp; Postal Station Ruins 郵便交換所</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

| June 16, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Hosoo Pass was a crucial route for the people living in the valley villages of southwestern Toyama and Johana Town, the closest major city. People living in these villages were largely cut off from the main Japanese society. One of the main transportation routes was along the Sho River <span class='ja'>庄川</span>, but the river only went through mountains in the north. A whole range of mountains encircled the southern end of Johana shielding the town from the valley.</p><p>So, the old Hosoo Pass route was established in 1887 (Meiji 20). It was fairly direct ascent up the mountains, but the road twisted enough that it was smooth travel for people and easy for horses, too. This 10 kilometer route was far more convenient than the 40 kilometer detour north following the river.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Halfway through the road, at the top of Hosoo Pass, you can clearly see Johana Town and the rest of the Takaoka and Tonami area.</p><p>These days that old route is no longer used. In 1927 (Showa 2), the Yahata Road <span class='ja'>八幡道路</span> was completed. It was a paved road that went directly from Johana Town, through Hosoo Pass, and continued to the Taira and Kamitaira villages before ending in Shimonashi village on Sho River. Part of this new road was the Hosoo Pass tunnel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the southern end of Hosoo Pass, continuing to Taira and Shimonashi villages, the old route went over Kakuma Pass <span class='ja'>鹿熊峠</span>, but in 1973, the Nashitani Tunnel <span class='ja'>梨谷トンネル</span> was completed which decommisioned that part of the route. In 1979, construction on the Gokayama Tunnel <span class='ja'>五箇山トンネル</span> began and finished in 1981. The tunnel went directly through the mountains and connected with the Nashitani Tunnel. Yahata Road going through Hosoo Pass was no longer necessary.</p><p>The road is still usable today despite the occassional fallen rocks and branches from the cliffs above. Old folks still drive along the road and clear the debris. Enough preventions have been set to prevent landslides, but eventually there could be a large enough landslide to knock out the road, rendering Hosoo Pass no longer travelable from the north.</p><div class='title'><b>Adventure</b></div><p>A few weeks ago, I traveled to Hosoo Pass. At the time, I knew nothing about the area, so I followed Google Map's suggestions, which lead me to several closed roads, taking too much time, and forcing me to return a few days later. That's the day that I went to that <a href="donohara-winter-branch-school" title="donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School</a>. That branch school was along the Sho River to the north of Shimonashi village.</p><p>On my second trip, I left my house early at 6:30am and arrived at Hosoo Pass around 8am, an hour by highway and 30 minutes on mountain roads. Before exploring the rest of Hosoo Pass and Yahata Road, I took the side path next to Hosoo Tunnel to climb Hakamagoshiyama. I detailed that hike in a <a href="hakamagoshiyama" title="hakamagoshiyama">different post</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Hosoo Pass Tea House Ruins <span class='ja'>細尾峠の茶屋</span></b></div><p>Today it's no longer a spectacle, but next to Hosoo Tunnel was a two story Tea House.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now all that remains are 7 metal posts sticking out of the ground and a bunch of metal garbage behind them. Much of that metal garbage is the old aluminum roof of the building. There was also a refrigerator back there, and a few other things.</p><p>I have no idea when the tea house was built, but it apparently had no running water, nor any electricity of its own. For those people who traveled along the old route in the Meiji and early Showa periods, this had to have been used as a rest stop in the middle of the journey from Johana to Taira or Shimonashi. Later, after it closed, construction companies used it as an office and warehouse.</p><p>Looking around the Internet, I found a webpage that had a photo of the tea house in the year 2001. I copied the page and <a href="/pages/hosoo.html" title="/pages/hosoo.html">hosted it here</a> as a backup. You could clearly see the 7 white metal posts holding up the front of the building, but many of the windows have been broken out, and the building doesn't look very safe.</p><p>I found some other photos other sites, too. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp">Here's a photo</a> of less than half of the building remaining from around 2005, I think.

There's a 3-meter drop to the ground from the road, and the ground is angled at 45 degrees. But apparently there's a trail down there which was the old Hosoo Pass route. Google Maps doesn't mark any kind of entry, but the OSM maps had a trail. And at those coordinates, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp">I found a rope</a>. The rope trails trials off into the brush going nearly straight down.</p><p>On my first trip, I did not believe that was the entry point, but I confirmed it later at home. When I came back on the weekend, I put on my worker gloves and scaled down to ground. The trail apparently hugs the road and then shoots off along the ridge of the mountain. </p><p>When there's no clear indication of a trail and you're cutting through brush, it's hard to tell if you're going the right way. I naturally followed the downward slope of the mountain, but then remembered this was not the way. I climbed up a bit, using the plants as handles and found a flattened spot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As I headed in the direction that seemed correct, I noticed a red flag on a tree. Okay, I am actually going the right way.</p><p>Most of the trail was completely covered in brush, but there were the occassional stone and cement bricks along the path. The trail did hug the road for a little bit before heading off in the direction of the mountain ridge.</p><p>And after 10 or 15 minutes, the ruins poked through the brush in front of me.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside the ruins was a large painted board that detailed the history of Hosoo Pass and the Post Office. I transcribed the board and put a translation <a href="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information">on this page</a>.</p><p>When the Taira Post Office was established in Shimonashi in 1872 (Meiji 5), the Postal Corps <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span> was also established. The Postal Corps was a group of people who lived in the villages of Taira and Shimonashi. This group of people would gather all the mail for the day and physically hike up to Hosoo Pass and down to Johana. They would collect the mail at Johana, and then return to Taira Post Office. Each person carried a maximum of 18 kilograms of mail and packages. </p><p>They did this 20 kilometer round trip every day, even in winter. When the traveled the formed a line of people. Sometimes in winter, blizzards would be so strong that it was difficult for the mail carriers to see the next person in front of them. They constantly had to sound off to make sure no one was left behind.</p><p>A few years later in 1887, the old Hosoo Pass route opened which made this travel must easier and faster. Again, in 1927 the paved road, Yahata Road, was opened which made travel more convenient in summer, and now mail could be transported by trucks. But the Postal Corps still transported the mail by foot in winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1945, ths Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office was built. Now, the Postal Corps had two teams. Both teams who would leave Taira and Johana post offices at 9am and meet here. Parcels and Mail would be exchanged between both teams. And then, they'd return to their towns. This cut travel time in half, but required more workers.</p><p>In 1955, as Japan experienced significant economic growth, many temporary workers were hired to match the workload. However, by 1971, the villages of Taira, Ueda, and all the areas around Shimonashi experienced significant depopulation. The current members of the corps were aging, and young people moved away to live in larger cities. The postal corps was abolished that year.</p><p>And again, the Nashitani and Gokayama tunnels were completed in 1973 and 1981, which made the road obsolete.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The brickwork and cement structure is still holding after 80 years, but all of the metalwork has rusted, and the roof of the office building has collapsed. Part of the roof still protects the signboard from the weather, though.</p><p>I took a few more pictures and then returned to the road. Out of the entrance to the Postal Exchange, the old route branches up and down the mountain. I wasn't paying close attention, but I managed to go the right way.</p><p>Moving along the ridge of the mountain, I came to the area underneath the paved road. The old route snaked along with the road until it came to that 3-meter drop off with the rope. But, I figured that I could just ascend anywhere that seemed easy enough to reach the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, this looked like a good spot. I grabbed the trees and climbed up. With each step, I grabbed the next bit of plants coming out of the ground. Often I would lose my footing and slip down, but I was able to keep advancing and pulling myself up. Inch by inch, I finally saw the outline of the road and had my exit in front of me.</p><p>I moved along the 3-meter drop off until some plants were high enough to vault me up to a guardrail pipe and then I yanked myself up onto the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I should have shimmied along the road back to the rope, but I was back to civilization, and back on easy street. I returned to my car and continued down towards Johana to meet the Gokayama Tunnel.</p><p>The road continued to snake along the edge of the mountain. Occassionally I would have to squeak my car to the side to let another car pass. Lots of people were using the road today. I'm not sure why.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8269_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Gokayama Tunnel Emergency Exit</b></div><p>Eventually around a corner of the mountain road, this structure came into view.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8304_t.webp" /></a></p><p>At first, I had no idea what this was. A small stream was flowing over part of it, so I thought it was a hydroelectric plant, using the natural spring of the mountain for power. There was an occassional whirring sound, too, which I thought it was a turbine or some kind of internal machinery.</p><p>The northern side of the structure had plastic windows, several of which were broken. I took a look inside, and a car whizzed by! Ah... I checked the map. This was part of the Gokayama tunnel.</p><p>Back at the large square garage-looking door, one of the emergency exits was not locked, and I could go inside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was about a kilometer into the 3km tunnel. The road wasn't super busy, but cars whizzed by every minute or so. Next to the emergency exit was an SOS phone. Wikipedia mentions that the Gokayama tunnel was built in two parts, so maybe this was the half point of its construction.</p><p>I took some photos, and then returned to my car. I continued to the end of Yahata Road, next to the mouth of the tunnel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There was some weird art structure nearby, but this was the end of Yahata Road.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakaide <span class='ja'>坂出</span></b></div><p>After 6 hours of hiking and driving around the old road, I went to Shimonashi for lunch. Sakaide was a small family owned restaurant in the center of Shimonashi village. They had the standard dishes of Udon, Soba, and Rice Bowls.</p><p>On the menu, I noticed that they served bear meat in their dishes, so I ordered the Bear Meat Soba, or <span class='ja'>くま肉そば</span>.</p><p>The soba was great, although soba is always great. I don't know how it stood apart from other soba I've had before. In the soba were chunks of cooked bear meat. It also wasn't really remarkable. They tasted like cuts of beef. It was good, but I think buying the mountain vegetable soba <span class='ja'>山菜そば</span> would've probably been better. Either way, it was exactly the meal I wanted for lunch. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When driving down the highways and motorways of Japan, there are so many side roads that go off along mountains or continue into forests. I have driven past hundreds of these roads and barely given a thought to where they lead.</p><p>Much like this case, they are often the original old roads that snaked around the mountain before tunnels were built. Also, these roads traveled to villages that once were and are no longer.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline of the Adventure</b></div><table>    <tr><td>6:30ish</td><td></td><td>Left Home</td></tr>    <tr><td>8:00am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Arrived at Hosoo Pass Tunnel</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591">36°26'51.0"N 136°53'48.4"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>8:25am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td><a href="/old/v7/hakamagoshiyama" title="/hakamagoshiyama">Hiking Hakamagoshiyama</a></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013">36°25'54.3"N 136°52'47.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427">36°25'56.6"N 136°52'49.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:15am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Tea House Ruins</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035">36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:30am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>(Jumping down the cliff)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997">36°26'56.2"N 136°54'01.4"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Finding the Post Office</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417">36°27'03.9"N 136°54'00.2"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:05am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Leaving the Post Office</td><td></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:15am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Climbing to the Road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224">36°26'59.7"N 136°54'03.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:25am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035">36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:50am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Highway Emergency Exit</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906">36°27'37.7"N 136°54'39.3"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Back to the Main Highway</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231">36°27'54.0"N 136°54'11.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>12:30pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Sakaide <span class='ja'>坂出</span> (for lunch)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503">36°25'59.3"N 136°56'54.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It apparently closed in 1972, but it was never torn down. The building has stayed abandoned since then, and the local farmers even repurposed it for storage of their farming equipment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now, nature has completely reclaimed the wooden building with trees and vines choking the remains of the structure. The front of the building is surrounded with tall grass, difficult to move through. The entrance to the school is completely shut from vines. The back of the building has tall trees towering over it. Bamboo trees also surround the old school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From certain angles, it's hard to tell there's even a building back there. Apparently later on in summer, the plants grow so high that you can't even reach it. Right now it's only the beginning of June, and already it's a bit difficult getting to the actual building.</p><p>It's a lot easier to move around the back of the building. The tree canopy prevents any of the grass growing. But, the back reveals that the building is in much worse shape.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The south end of the roof has collapsed, probably from the weight of winter snow. As the roof collapsed, it took the second floor, staircase, and back wall with it. Much of the electrical wiring of the building is now exposed.</p><p>Looking at the wood work around the building, it seemed like the local farmers adding a bunch of bracing and other wooden beams to keep the building together. But, a lot of the wood looks like it's been chewed through by termites. Even though the nearby fields look like someone has still been using them, no one has seemed to touch this building recently at all.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school building looks like it had 4 rooms. The main room in the above photo was probably the office. The room leading off to the right was mostly likely the classroom. Then, there was a store room to right in the photo above, about the size of a closet. And lastly, a staircase that went up to another room. I don't know what they would've used that for.</p><p>According to folks on the Internet, the building finished construction in 1957, and in 1959, it serviced only 8 students, the children of the people living in this small farming plateau. 10 years later in 1969, there were only 4 students. It apparently closed in 1972.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going back to the full title of this building, it's the Former Higashinakae Elementary - Sugio Branch - Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>旧東中江小学校杉尾分校渡原冬季分校</span>.</p><p>In 1999, Higashinakae Elementary School <span class='ja'>平村立東中江小学校</span> merged with nearby school Shimonashi Elementary School <span class='ja'>下梨小学校</span>. Both schools were part of Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> at the time, and the new school was named Taira Elementary School <span class='ja'>平小学校</span>. This school used the Shimonashi ES building, so the Higashinakae building was no longer used.</p><p>Side tangent, but in 2004, due to depopulation, Toyama (and many other prefectures at the time) restructured many of its outlying villages and municipalities into larger cities. Taira village joined the other south western villages together into Nanto City. In 2006, Taira Elementary was closed, but the building is still used every day as the administrative building for the residents. It also has the post office, a clinic, and a few stores, too.</p><p>Anyways, back in the day, many of the schools (especially elementary schools) in remote areas had branch schools. Branch schools were mainly used in winter when traveling was difficult. It was much easier for a teacher or two to travel and stay there for a week, rather than the students of the area traveling to the main school building every day.</p><p>The Sugio Branch School <span class='ja'>杉尾分校</span> was in the Sugio neighborhood area further north down the river. The Donohara neighborhood was between Sugio and Higashinakae, and apparently it was too far for those 8 students to go to either school, so the Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>渡原冬季分校</span> was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The tiny area of Donohara is a plataeu above the main road going along the river down to the main Nanto City. Getting to this small area isn't too bad with my Kei car, but I'm not quite sure how a 1950s bus could safely get up here. Maybe they used a smaller bus to navigate the narrow winding road? Or maybe the students just met the bus at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>The narrow road leading to Donohara overlooks the Owatari Bridge <span class='ja'>大渡橋</span>, which was opened in 1958, only a year after the Winter Branch School was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Obviously in summer it's pretty easy to move around, but in winter, I imagine they probably don't even plow this narrow road.</p><p>Looking through photos from just a few years ago, I think the damage to the school building is very recent. Maybe it happened this winter? I wonder how much longer until they completely remove the building. Although, it's remote enough that it'll probably stay until it becomes an actual hazard, or someone buys the land.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Japan Travel Map Page" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/japan-travel-map-page">Japan Travel Map Page</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I love discovering and learning about new and interesting places and their history. I have lived here for over 12 years now, but it's been almost 19 years since I first came here and became inspired to explore, take photos, and research.</p><p>Recently, I have been going through a lot of old unsorted, unprocessed photos and unfinished posts of travels. With nearly 200 posts talking about Japanese travel and locations, I wanted to see all these locations on a map. Through doing research about some locations, I found an open source JavaScript mapping library called <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, and I've added a page with all these links pinned on a map.</p><p>Use the following link to view the <a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map">Japan Travel Map</a> page.</p><p class='img'><a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Travel Page is a little bit of a work-in-progress at the moment, so the styles and features may be updated or changed in the future.</p><p>I learned about Leaflet from visiting <a href="https://haikyo.info/" title="https://haikyo.info/">Haikyo.info</a>. This site is a collection of abandoned places around Japan and whether or not its possible to trespass and explore. I came across the site when trying to find information about the <a href="/old/v7/red-factory" title="/red-factory">Red Factory</a>, an old abandoned factory which was highly rated among ruins explorers. </p><p>Leaflet has been super easy to use. Going through their <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html" title="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html">Tutorials</a>, their quick start guide puts a map on a webpage almost immediately. Plotting points is incredibly simple, too, once you get the geo coordinates. It gets a little more complicated when you want to use layers to filter certain points on the map, but it was really just an extra step. You can take a look at the code, but there's not a whole lot of special things going on underneath.</p><p>By the way, the Red Factory is one post in a series of posts from 2016 when my friends Fishy and Chaos came to visit.

It was fought between the Western Army led by Ishida Mitsunari on behalf of the newly established somewhat traditional government of Japan, and Tokugawa Ieyasu who considered Japan weak to outsiders and wanted to establish a new government. Tokugawa won the battle, and after establishing a new government brought forth 250 years of peace and prosperity. This stability led to a sharp increase in population, education, and overall wellbeing.</p><p>The battle happened on October 21st, 1600.</p><div class='title'><b>Leading to the Battle</b></div><p>In the 1500s, Japan was in chaos. The time is referred to the Warring States period, or Sengoku-jidai <span class='ja'>戦国時代</span>. It's called this because Japan was in a constant state of civil war. In 1573, Oda Nobunaga led his army to the capital and overthrew reigning Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki. From there, his army spread out conquering the nearby kingdoms.</p><p>In the middle of his conquest, he was betrayed and committed seppuku rather than be captured. This was in 1582. He was succeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi who continued the conquest, and brought all of Japan together as a single kingdom by 1592. He restored power to the emperor, but he was really the one in charge. In 1593, his second son was born, and planned on succeded him as grand regeant to the emperor.</p><p>Toyotomi died in 1598 leaving behind his 5-year-old son, and a council of regeants to teach and advise him until he was old enough to assume his position. This is where the TV show and novel <b>Shogun</b> begins. Immediately after his death, the Council of Five Regeants begin scheming and allying to seize control of Japan for themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Shogun and The Council of Five</b></div><p>The Shogun TV show is slightly different than history, and of course all the names have been changed. The Council of Five had the following members: <b>Tokugawa</b> Ieyasu <span class='ja'>徳川家康</span>, <b>Ukita</b> Hideie <span class='ja'>宇喜多秀家</span>, <b>Maeda</b> Toshiie <span class='ja'>前田利家</span>, <b>Uesugi</b> Kagekatsu <span class='ja'>上杉景勝</span>, and <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span>. Mori only became a member of the council because of his uncle's death a year prior. His uncle was <b>Kobayakawa</b> Takakage <span class='ja'>小早川隆景</span>, who is sometimes considered an honorary member of The Council.</p><p>Almost immediately after Toyotomi's death, Tokugawa began a series of marriage pacts and campaigns to secure his family, despite it being forbidden by the council laws. Maeda was said to have been part of this conspiracy. <b>Ishida</b> Mitsunari <span class='ja'>石田三成</span> was one of the highest level bureacrats in Toyotomi's government. He considered Tokugawa's action a complete insult to Toyotomi's legacy and quickly aligned himself with Ukita, Mori, and Uesugi. He also had powerful friendships with <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span> and <b>Shima</b> Sakon <span class='ja'>島清興</span>. </p><p>While Ishida gained the support of many lords of western kingdoms, Tokugawa gained support from the east. One of his strongest allies was <b>Kuroda</b> Nagamasa <span class='ja'>黒田長政</span>, who was perhaps the best military strategist in Japan at that time. He was the chief strategist for Toyotomi. Ishida apparently loathed and often insulted the military commanders, so Kuroda and six other commanders planned to assassinate him. Tokugawa actually quelled their attempt, and later recruited all of them in his Eastern Army.</p><p>Several skermishes in the east and west pulled the armies together as they met in Sekigahara on October 21, 1600.</p><div class='title'><b>The Battle Stage</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the morning of the battle, a thick fog covered Sekigahara. No one could see more than a few meters in front of them. But with the sunrise, the fog had disspated by around 8am and all the armies could see their opponents.</p><p>The Eastern Army led by <b>Tokugawa</b> is red. They created a "fish scale" battle pattern with the main forces creating a line directly opposing the Western Army. <b>Kuroda</b> <span class='ja'>黒田</span> and <b>Takenaka</b> <span class='ja'>竹中</span> positioned themselves on Okayama hill <span class='ja'>岡山</span> in the north overlooking the battlefield. <b>Fukushima</b> <span class='ja'>福島</span> led the main force on the frontline poised to strike first.</p><p>The Western Army is mainly blue, but also consists of the yellow and green armies at the start of the battle. They are multi-colored because of some key moments in the battle which led to their defeat. The main force was led by <b>Ukita</b> <span class='ja'>宇喜多</span>, one of the Five Regeants. <b>Ishida</b> <span class='ja'>石田</span> positioned himself with <b>Shima</b> <span class='ja'>島</span> at the most northern on the army line on Sasaoyama <span class='ja'>笹尾山</span>. Colored in blue, the furthest south is <b>Otani</b> <span class='ja'>大谷</span>, Ishida's other close friend. But, the largest army on the southern end of the west army was <b>Kobayakawa</b> <span class='ja'>小早川</span>, colored in yellow.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, the Western Army had around 82,000 soldiers compared to the Eastern Army's 88,888. Fearing Ishida's defeat, several lords who pledged support for Ishida did not attend the battle.</p><div class='title'><b>The Battle Begins</b></div><p>As the fog cleared, it is said that <b>Ii</b> Naomasa <span class='ja'>井伊直政</span> and <b>Matsudaira</b> Tadayoshi <span class='ja'>松平忠吉</span> of the Eastern Army ordered their gunmen to take aim and fire on <b>Ukita's</b> army. <b>Fukushima</b> <span class='ja'>福島</span>, frontline battle commander of the Eastern Army and who was promised first-attack by Tokugawa, became enraged and ordered his whole army to quickly join the fight against <b>Ukita</b>. From Okayama Hill, <b>Kuroda</b> <span class='ja'>黒田</span> noticed that the battle had begun, and fired his flare to signal all frontline Eastern armies to attack the West. The full engagement of the battle began sometime between 8am and 10am.</p><p>The Eastern Army moved in to engage the Western Army, and with the frontlines of both armies holding off each other, Tokugawa began advancing his groups from the far east of the battlefield to encourage his troops and also scare his opponents.</p><p>All the while, <b>Kobayakawa</b> <span class='ja'>小早川</span> stood on the top of Mt. Matsuo <span class='ja'>松尾山</span>, his forces never joining the battle. Prior to the battle, he had made an agreement with Tokugawa through Kuroda. He would betray Ishida and join the fight as a member of the Eastern Army. But, he had yet to make any move. Ishida fired a flare signalling him to attack, but still he stood there with indecision. </p><p>Apparently, it wasn't until Tokugawa's troops fired some warning shots at him that <b>Kobayakawa</b> ordered his troops down the hill and attack <b>Otani</b> <span class='ja'>大谷</span>, the nearest of the Western Army. Otani was prepared for Kobayakawa's betrayal, but didn't expect several others to join him. His forces could not withstand their rush attack. Otani committed seppuku in the woods and ordered his retainer to hide his head to prevent it from getting into enemy hands. </p><p>All of the yellow armies were now members of the Eastern Army. Behind the Eastern Army, in the back, marked in green, were forces led by the <b>Mori</b> <span class='ja'>毛利</span> clan. They pledged to fight for the Western Army, but were prevented from joining when one of their armies refused to fight. And after seeing Kobayakawa turn, they knew that winning was hopeless.</p><p>With <b>Otani's</b> forces eradicted, <b>Kobayakawa's</b> betrayal, and <b>Mori's</b> neutrality, the Western Army had collapsed. The was no way for <b>Ishida</b> to win. His friend Otani was dead. His other friend, Shima, was missing and presumed killed in battle. Four other battle commanders were also killed. He ordered a retreat. He, Ukita, and a few others escaped from the battle.</p><p><b>Shimadzu</b> Yoshihiro <span class='ja'>島津義弘</span> and nephew <b>Shimadzu</b> Toyohisa <span class='ja'>島津豊久</span>, leaders of their forces in the Western Army refused to turn their backs to the enemy to retreat. While the battle had mostly concluded by 2pm, they launched a surprise offensive to the middle of the frontline, piercing through the Eastern Army. And making their retreat to the south. The nephew was killed in this surprise attack/retreat, but Yoshihiro could escape.</p><p>The Battle was over. The full length of the battle only took around 6 hours, although the main clash of armies only took place from Kuroda's signal flare to not long after Otani committed seppuku. Of the Western Army's 82,000 soldiers, 23,000 had defected and 35,270 were killed. The Eastern Army only lost 8,000 soldiers.</p><div class='title'><b>After the Battle</b></div><p>As the fighting ceased, the remaining Western soldiers were either captured or executed. Tokugawa put down a folding stool in the field near his final encampment and performed the post-battle ritual called the Head Viewing Ceremony, or kubi-jikken <span class='ja'>首実検</span>.</p><p>This spot and so many other key locations of the battle have been preserved in modern day Sekigahara.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here is the location where Tokugawa sat as he inspected the heads. Next to this is a plaque which describes the scene:</p><p><i>Tokugawa Ieyasu, fresh from his decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara, sat here on a folding stool called a shogi to inspect the heads of the enemy commanders his allies presented. The heads, once inspected, were buried in two great mounds along with the corpses from the battlefield. During the Warring States Period, it was customary to mourn the dead of both sides, enemy and ally alike, so this inspection was also a gesture of respect for the dead.</i></p><p>Wikipedia continues by explaining that the Head Viewing Ceremony was a way of mourning and respecting the dead of both sides, but it was also a way for victorious commanders and soldiers to get recognized for their valor in the battle, and get properly rewarded for it. This scene is illustrated at <a href="/old/v7/sekigahara-warland$0023head-viewing" title="/sekigahara-warland#head-viewing">Sekigahara Warland.</a></p><p>After the heads were inspected, they were wrapped in cloth and placed in one of two massive burial mounds along with the corpses of the dead.</p><p>Today, the site of the Head Viewing Ceremony and Tokugawa's final encampment is the location of the new Battle of Sekigahara museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Battle of Sekigahara Museum</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Battle of Sekigahara Museum opened recently in 2020, and while I consider the museum a must visit if you're going to Sekigahara, it is a very uneven experience. I arrived just as the museum opened at 9:30am. Tickets are only 500<span class='ja'>円</span> which includes a theater experience, if reservations are not full. I was first on the standby list for the film starting at 9:45am. There were only a few reservations ahead of me.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Theater</b></div><p>Entering the theater, you walk down a hallway with projected names of the wall of all those involved in the battle. The first theater is a trapezoidal room with a projected map on the floor. The map begins showing dates and events leading up to the battle. It shows a full map of Japan where Ishida and Tokugawa allies were located, and zooms in on the center of Japan as their forces begin to converge in Sekigahara.</p><p>As everyone entered the room and surrounded the map, the film was introduced by the guide and then it began. It quickly went through the leading dates and events again, and then showed Sekigahara. Each army, their commander, and their position on the map was introduced, and then the battle began as I had described it above. </p><p>As each key moments of the battle played out, the armies moved on the map and clashed with their opponents. It was kind of like a strategy game, which became an incredibly effective way of showing how the battle progressed. The soldiers themselves were tiny little colored men, but the commanders of those armies were blown up giants when their key moments took place. They spoke their intentions with emotion and feeling which illustrated some intensity of the battle.</p><p>As the battle concluded, everyone moved into the next, octogonal theater. This one had theater seating. I sat in the back and the film began showing the same battle, but this time, from the point of view of the ground rather than a birdseye view. The film was projected onto half of the room, giving us a 180 view of the battle. Fans mounted on the ceiling blew air at us and we sweeped around the battle. Lights flashed as gun fire erupted. And the ground shook and rumbled our seats as horses ran past. Once again, each of the key moments of battle were highlighted showing us the emotion of the commanders and their decisions which led to either victory or defeat.</p><p>It was a pretty hyped experience and incredibly effective at teaching us about the battle and those involved. Prior to the museum, I really only knew about Ishida and Tokugawa, and also knew about Otani committing seppuku. Now I knew about the majority of key commanders in the battle and what they did. I don't think I have ever visited a museum and came out learning as much as I had from this.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Exhibit</b></div><p>The theater experience is in STARK contrast to the rest of the museum. After exiting the theater, we rode the escalator to the second floor. The second floor exhibit shows the number of soldiers in each of the army, and then displays replica armor of each of the commanders. Shiny new looking armor, obviously not realistic to what they actually wore at the time.</p><p>From there, several letters were displayed of correspondence between commanders leading up to the battle. I had no idea what any of these were at the time. They might be more interesting now that I've researched the battle in more detail for these blog posts.</p><p>Overall, the main exhibit of the museum was just a bunch of stuff that wasn't presented with a strong connection to the subject. It was completely different compared with the film on the first floor. At the end of the exhibit, there were some swords and guns that you could pick up to feel their weight, but it felt kinda tacked on.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Observatory</b></div><p>The fifth floor gave a 360-degree view of Sekigahara. The museum was in the very center of town and the center of the battle, so you could see everything from this point.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>Looking east is Mt.

He secretly made a deal with Kuroda and Tokugawa that if he prevented the Mori clan from attacking, the Mori clan would retain all their lands after battle. Kikkawa kept his word and prevented the Mori clan from attacking, but the Mori had no knowledge of this neutrality. After the battle, Kikkawa was labeled a traitor to the clan, and the Mori was still punished for supporting Ishida.</p><p>At the base of Mt.

At this time, Kazumasa hung the statue of the Omononushi <span class='ja'>大物主神</span>, the diety of Kotohira Shrine (from his hometown of Kotohira Town in Kagawa Prefecture, called Sanuki province at the time), which he had been carrying on a pine branch and prayed for victory in the battle.</i></p><p><i>After the Battle, the villages are said to have received this statue and worshipped it. It is also said that during the Keio period, the village headman of Sekigahara, Furuyama Ichiya <span class='ja'>古山一八</span>, renovated the shrine's buldings. After that, the entire village of Sekigahara revered the god of business and the Kotohira-Ko <span class='ja'>金刀比羅講</span> was organized. Every year on October 10th, a representative was sent to the main shrine in Sanuki (Kagawa pref.) to present a sacred talisman. (This is no longer done.)

Kuroda's army then destroyed Mitsunari's remaining forces.</i></p><p>While Kuroda started at the top of the Okayama, when the battle turned to the East's favor, I'm sure they all left this position to put further pressure on the West and eventually eradicate them.</p><div class='title'><b>Mt.

Sasao gave Ishida a full view of Sekigahara. Ishida could see all of his armies on the west and also see all the armies of the east coming at him. Okayama's plateau was probably visible at the time, but if not, you could still clearly see any army coming from that location, with the exception of Kuroda's flank attack which went further north, using the forest as cover.</p><p>The nearby plaque had the following to say:</p><p><i>Mt. Sasao was the perfect defensive position, providing high ground and a panoramic view. Ishida Mitsunari's approximately 6,000 troops departed Ogaki Castle in the dead of the night on October 20th and set up camp here, around 1am on October 21, the day of the battle.</i></p><p><i>The battle commenced around 8am. Mitsunari's troops, fronted by Shima Sakon, repeated repulsed attacks from the powerful Eastern armies, but were gradually forced to retreat.</i></p><p><i>The Western Army fought bravely, despite Shimadzu Yoshihiro, Kobayakawa Hideaki, and Mori Hidemoto failing to enter the battle, greatly reducing the Western Army's total fighting force.</i></p><p><i>Hideaki finally switched allegiances joining the Eastern cause around noon, attacking and annihilating Otani Yoshitsugu's troops, starting a chain reaction that brought the Western Army down. Mitsunari's troops persevered against the advancing Eastern forces, but were finally defeated around 2pm. In the hopes of raising another army, Mitsunari fled west towards Mt. Ibuki.</i></p><p>It says the Shimadzu was unable to join the battle? I don't know what that means, as everything I had seen so far has him in the battle.</p><p>Mt.

Sasao.</p><p>The Battlefield Monument plaque had the following to say:</p><p><i>Although the Western Army was initially numerically superior to the Eastern forces, Kobayakawa Hideaki, who had previously pledged to betray his Western allies, remained a spectator to the battle, leaving Ishida Mitsunari to fight valiantly with less troops.</i></p><p><i>Despite this, the Western Army fought intently with repeated advances and retreats until around noon, when Hideaki finally turned his allegiances to the East and intentionally attacked the Western Army, resulting in its total defeat. It is thought that Mitsunari and Shimadzu Yoshihiro's troops were then overwhelmed by the advancing Eastern Army. With Mitsunari's units soon overrun, the Shimadzu clan retreated from the front lines. Japan's largest ever and most decisive battle was over in a mere half-a-day.</i></p><p>This field is where some of the battle reenactments take place.</p><div class='title'><b>Mt.

The other locations were as simple as parking the car and walking up the stairs. This one actually took time in additional to the time stopped to take photos.

Matsuo provided a panoramic view of Sekigahara and was therefore a strategically important position. Kobayakawa Hideaki stationed his troops here the day before the battle on October 20th.</i></p><p><i>Hideaki had formed a pact with Eastern leader Tokugawa Ieyasu prior to this, but failed to take action once the battle commenced. According to some, Ieyasu is said to have fired matchlock guns at Mt. Matsuo to bring about Hideaki's promised defection.</i></p><p><i>Hideaki finally commenced the attack on the Western forces around midday, first defeating Otani Yoshitsugu's troops destroying the Western Army. Hideaki played a major role in the Eastern Army's victory. He was awarded vast territories in Bizen, Okayama after the battle, but died two years later aged just 21.</i></p><p>The hike up the mountain wasn't difficult at all compared to other mountains I have hiked before. This particular path probably didn't exist at the time, and the overall mountain may have had several paths more suited for horses and infantry movements.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3789_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The summit did give a great view of the totality of Sekigahara, so Kobayakawa was able to see all the armies engage each other in the middle and see all their movements. You can clearly see Ishida and Kuroda's positions at Mt. Sasao and Okayama.</p><p>The above plaque and other research says that Kobayakawa finally made his decision to betray Ishida when Tokugawa fired shots at Mt. Matsuo to force him into a decision. But, other scholars have pointed out that with the chaos of battle and general distance, there would really be no way for him to tell the difference between shots fired at him or anyone else in battle.</p><p>The plaque at the top of the mountain had some other insights:</p><p><i>Mt. Matsuo, located here on the border between Mino (Gifu prefecture) and Omi (Shiga prefecture) overlooking vital roadways from its 293m summit, has long been recognized as a strategic viewpoint. Prior to the Battle of Sekigahara, Western commander Ishida Mitsunari ordered maintenance work be done to the mountaintop castle as part of the preparations against the Eastern forces. The existing remains of the castle are from the time of these repairs. One day before the battle, Kobayakawa Hideaki led his 15,000 troops here to Mt. Matsuo and entered the castle.</i></p><p><i>For much of the battle, Kobayakawa remained a spectator to the action taking place below, failing to fight for one side or the other until around midday, when he betrayed the Western side. Attacking Otani Yoshitsugu's forces, Kobayakawa brought about the downfall of the Western ranks, and provided victory to the Eastern Army.</i></p><p><i>A large area near the top of the mountain has been flattened, and is surrounded by a low earthen wall. The remains of a masugata gate system to prevent enemy intrusion can also be found. The ruins cover an area of around 400m east to west and 250m north to south, indicating that Matsuo Castle was one of the largest mountain castles in the Mino (Gifu) area.</i></p><p>There used to be so many smaller castles in Japan, especially battle castles perched on mountains at strategic points. Nearly all of those castles are gone now, having been destroyed by whomever took them over.</p><p>Also at the summit were 6 frogs hanging out in a muddy bit of water makin' babies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, no matter whether Kobayakawa saw the warning shots or ultimately made the decision on his own after viewing the battle, his troops rode straight down the mountain and into the forest directly north to face the troops of <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span>.</p><div class='title'><b>Otani's Gravesite and Encampment</b></div><p>While Kobayakawa's encampment was the final place I visited in Sekigahara on that day, I went to Otani's encampment in the morning before going to the museum.

From here, it was possible to see Mt. Matsuo, where Kobayakawa Hideaki had stationed his army. Yoshitsugu remained suspicious of Hideaki's intentions and prepared himself accordingly.</i></p><p><i>Too sick to ride a horse, he is said to have led his men into battle from a palanquin. Yoshitsugu's troops were prepared for Hideaki's attack when he defected around noon. Initially the Otani repelled the powerful turncoat forces, but were overcome owing to Wakisaka Yasuharu and others also turning sides.</i></p><p>It must've been around here or slightly further into the forest where after being told that the battle was hopeless, Otani admitted defeat and committed seppuku.</p><p>Further into the forest was Otani's grave.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3027_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The nearby plaque tells the story of his demise:</p><p><i>Otani Yoshitsugu was overrun following the betrayal of Kobayakawa Hideaki and his followers. Demanding that his head never fall into the hands of the enemy, Yoshitsugu commited ritual suicide and his retainer, Yuasa Gosuke, hid Yoshitsugu's severed head, before encountering Todo Takanori of the Eastern Army. Gosuke offered his own head in return for the location of his master's head never being revealed. Takanori kept this promise and never told Tokugawa Ieyasu the whereabouts of the head.</i></p><p><i>Yoshitsugu's gravestone was erected by the Todo clan. The Yuasa family erected a gravestone to Gosuke besides Yoshitsugu's in 1916.</i></p><p>Obviously, the gravesite is still regularly attended today. The graves had fresh flowers and were clear of leaves and any other debris.</p><p>Otani's loyalty and death at the cost of his loyalty is ultimately revered. He went into battle probably knowing that it would not turn out well for him, but he still stood by his beliefs in Ishida and his ideals of the Toyotomi government.</p><p>Near his grave, a monument was built to remind everyone of his sacrafice.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3009_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plaque reads:</p><p><i>The tactics and strategies of the Battle of Sekigahara were studied by Japan's armed forces during the late 1800's Meiji period, the early 1900's Showa militarization period, and military exercises were conducted on the actual battlefield.</i></p><p><i>This monument was erected in 1940 by the Fuwa Historical Preservation Society in memory of Otani Yoshitsugu, who's end was seen as the epitome of Bushido.</i></p><p><i>The summary is as follows: Despite his ignored advice warning Ishida Mitsunari against raising arms, Otani Yoshitsugu allied himself with, and fought hard for the Western forces out of loyalty to his former master, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, whom he served alongside Mitsunari. Being outnumbered and having lost his battle, he sacrificed himself by his own hand in the true Bushido spirit.</i></p><p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, people ultimately respect Otani and his sacrafice the most.</p><p>On the other hand, people seem to hate Kobayakawa, despite his actions causing Tokugawa to win and create peace and prosperity for 250 years. At the museum, each ticket is printed with a warlord. The person behind me in line got Kobayakawa on her ticket, and her date was teasing her the whole time. <span class='ja'>いやだ〜</span>, she kept saying.</p><div class='title'><b>Remembrance</b></div><p>The biggest reason people love this battle and its legacy continues to this day with TV shows, movies, manga, and other media is that the decisive victory completely changing the history of Japan. After the battle and after Tokugawa successfully rooted out the rest of the Toyotomi loyalists, he had complete control over the country, and his dictatorship led to great prosperity.</p><p>But, the other big reason for everyone's interest in the battle is also its divisiveness. Tokugawa was an asshole who completely undermined Toyotomi's rule immediately after his death. It was an insult to Toyotomi and Ishida was very outspoken about this. Others who also hated Tokugawa's attitude continued to stoke Ishida into action, and the schemes and political bullshit continued from there. While Ishida was also a bit of an asshole, he represented loyalty and honor. Many of his friends and commanders in the Western Army were the same.</p><p>The battle was ultimately a fight between those loyal to the current ideals of Japan and the strength of someone wanting all the power for himself. It's far different than people remembering something like the American Civil War, which was fought over slavery, something clearly right or wrong.</p><p>The TV show, Shogun, portrays Tokugawa as an underdog with Ishida trying to keep all the power for himself, but in reality it seems completely different. Of course, Shogun isn't trying to be completely historically accurate, but it still becomes pro-Tokugawa propaganda. The show really contextualized Japan's xenophobia at the time as the Europeans seemed intent on conquering Japan for themselves.</p><p>There is also a 2017 Japanese film based on a 1966 Japanese novel about the Battle of Sekigahara. It won a couple of awards, too, so I would like to see how they portray all the characters. Will they portray them in a neutral manor so the audience must decide which side was right? Or will they portray Tokugawa as a traitor to the current ideals of Japan or Ishida as a foolish conservative?</p><p>After visiting the sites and museums, I am more on the side of Ishida in this fight, even though it is clear that his loss was a necessity for Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Revisit</b></div><p>I am way more informed about the Battle than I was before having visited these locations, gone through all the photos, and looked up all the information online.</p><p>Now, there are several more locations I want to visit, like Mori's encampment on Mt. Nangu, Shimadzu's and Ukita's encampment in the middle of the Western Army, Fukushima's encampment at the head of the Eastern army, some of the other local folklore museums in Sekigahara, and the Sekigahara visitor center at the station. I would also like to visit the Battle museum and Samurai Armor museum again with my now better base of knowledge.</p><p>There are so many minor lords who participated in the battle, too, who each have their story. Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, founder of modern day Takayama, also participated in the battle with around 1,000 troops. I wonder if they placed a marker at his position.</p><p>I definitely want to check out the Battle Reenactment festival, too, so maybe I'll visit all these locations in October, if there's time. We'll see.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
