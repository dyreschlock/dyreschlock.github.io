I think the Showa period of Japan is fun to research and peruse as it contains so many building blocks that have morphed into today's capitolistic society. How were products advertised to people 60 years ago? What sort of products were people buying back then? It's interesting how something so sophisticated and advanced back then is mostly trash and garbage today.</p><p>The Showa Goods Museum <span class='ja'>昭和レトロ商品博物館</span> in Ome (west west Tokyo) focuses on the commercialism of the 50s, 60s, and 70s. It's not a very big museum, like other retro museums I have visited. There's only one main room, and it was lined with displays cases that focused on different categories of products, such as stationery, toiletries, medicine, cigarettes, coca-cola, games, and sweets. The entrance had display cases with candy, soda, and cameras.</p><p>After looking through all of the cases, I think my favorite product was a pair of upscale fancy face masks. I love the design of the man and woman on the cover of the box. In the 50s, this style was probably considered peak fashion. But now the colors have faded, the box is rotted and tore, and the mask looks like its about to fall apart. It's a real metaphor of fashion through the passage of time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5365_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Their replica movie poster paintings were their most prized possessions, though. Or maybe they were restored originals? They had a recent photo that showed a man painting them. (I did not read the fine print.) These posters were incredibly vivid and striking.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5327_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, they had an exhibition room which focused on the Japanese folk tale, Yuki-Onna <span class='ja'>雪おんな</span>, literally translated as Snow Woman. There were diorama displays showing each of the key scenes from the tale, various copies of books that reprinted the tale, photos of an author, and some inspired art.</p><p>Almost all Japanese folktales, including Yuki-Onna, originated hundreds of years ago, so I don't think it really fit with the Showa theme. However, it is one of more popular tales and authors in the early 1900s (before Showa) wrote the modern version of it. Maybe it was super popular in Showa times.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5489_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Entry for the Showa Goods Museum was only 350<span class='ja'>円</span>, but you could buy a 500<span class='ja'>円</span> combination tickets for another museum just down the block, the Showa Gentou-kan <span class='ja'>昭和幻燈館</span>. Gentou basically means a slide as part of slide projection. The front face of the store sold headshots of many actors and actresses of the 60s and 70s.</p><p>The main part of Gentou-kan was a showcase all of this cat artwork, and the best part about the displays were the parody Kanban signs. I got photos of all sixteen of them.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, the shop only had one small piece of merch connected to the signs. It was the Bread Kanban Sign, but they went a step further than the original by changing <span class='ja'>パン</span> (bread) to <span class='ja'>ニャン</span> (meow). I probably should've bought it, but I refrained.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251221_showa/IMG_5544_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Overall it was a cute museum, but it seemed far away from everything else. I don't think it'd be worth the trip on its own. But, if you were already in the area, I think the small 350<span class='ja'>円</span> entry fee is an easy sell.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/kudou-teruhi-art-museum">Kudou Teruhi Art Museum 工藤耀日美術館</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Everyone carves out their own small spaces within the narrow alleys and multi-story buildings of the cities, and the dense forests and sharp cliffs of the country. There are so many unique locations and perspectives that so many of them are overlooked and somewhat undiscovered. It can feel magical when you step into one.</p><p>I think the Kudou Teruhi Museum <span class='ja'>工藤耀日美術館</span> is such a location.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4991_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span> is an artist and painter born in 1939. Frustrated with the pressures and constructs of Japanese art and society, he sold all his possessions in 1986 and moved to China to discover his own identity. 18 years later, he returned to Japan and purchased the newly closed Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> in the north western mountains of Yamanashi Prefecture. He used the school building as his studio and opened the building to the public in 2008 as a museum to host his works. </p><p>Perhaps the most impressive showcase of his art is his massive mural lining the walls of the old junior high gymnasium.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_4998_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The mural seems to cover a few periods of his life's work: his Women in Waves series inspired by the style of Pablo Picasso, his journey of Han Dynasty art represented by the dragon, and his paintings of Yamataka Jindai Zakura, the 2000-year old Cherry Blossom tree near the city down the mountain. He has been working on this for over 10 years.</p><p>Looking through old photos online, the mural was an evolving and continual effort over the last decade and it should continue to evolve in the future. There was a new piece on the floor in-progress.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5148_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The current location of the museum is in Sutama Town Obi District <span class='ja'>須玉町小尾</span> part of Hokuto City <span class='ja'>北杜市</span>. When Masutomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>増富中学校</span> was built in 1947, the area was Masutomi Village <span class='ja'>増富村</span>. The village would be abolished in 1959. One by one, each of the mountain villages in the area became incorporated into Sudama Town <span class='ja'>須玉町</span> with Masutomi being the final piece. The area was named to Sudama Town Obi. Sudama was later renamed to Sutama in 1990.</p><p>Masutomi Junior High School closed in March 2004 due to further depopulation of the mountain villages. Any remaining students were transported by bus to Sutama Junior High School at the base of the mountain. Later that year in November 2004, governmental mergers combined all northwestern municipalities into a single city, Hokuto City.</p><p>Now, there doesn't really seem to be many people up here. Only the elderly folks who have lived here for over half a millenia remain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5045_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When I arrived, I looked around to see if I was in the right place. I saw someone in the window and soon after an elderly man popped out of the main building. This was Kudou Teruhi <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. He came out to greet me. I asked about the museum and he immediately pulled me into the gym to see the mural. He told me about working on the mural for over 10 years and about when he came here.</p><p>Next, he brought me into the main building to see the rest of his work. The entrance way displayed some of his contemporary works, a series of Chinese dragons. The first floor of the old junior high school had an open room (probably a multi-purpose room), the 1st-year homeroom, and 2nd-year homeroom. The open room displayed more murals of his women series. I think they were interchangeable screens used in his gymnasium mural.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5052_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next room displayed his original work of his women series. He painted this series in 2005 and had photos of his exhibition of the series in Barcelona. </p><p>He took this time to explain his name. All of these paintings were signed as Kenji Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤賢司</span>, not his actual name, Teruhi Kudou <span class='ja'>工藤耀日</span>. For almost all his life, he used Kenji Kudou as a pen name for his work because it sounded much better. Much of his work and life was inspired by Pablo Picasso, and the name Pablo Picasso had a rhyme and rhythm that he absolutely loved. Kenji Kudou had a similar rhythm, so he used it.</p><p>It wasn't until he returned to Japan in his late 60s that he felt he had found his identity and wanted to mark his work as who he was, rather than someone else he was trying to be in his youth. His chapter as Kenji Kudou was complete and he could now be a painter as himself.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5078_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next classroom displayed painted murals of Mt. Huangshan in China. While living in China, he hiked these mountains and was inspired as many artists have been in the past. Clouds cover most of the mountains, but when you climb the high peaks, you can see all the mountains in the range poke up from the white below into the sky.</p><p>It's apparently one of the most beautiful scenes in the world. He drew several sketches of the landscapes and painted those scenes at a large scale.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5100_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, the personalized tour continued with the next room focused on paintings influenced by Han Dynasty history and culture. The painting above is titled "Animals From Han Dynasty."</p><p>In the next room, he had paintings from an assortment of series. He had a series that focused on Shingen Takeda and Yukitaka Sanada, two samurai legends of Yamanashi prefecture. He had a painting of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5111.webp">Michael Jackson</a>, and more recent Women paintings which bore his Teruhi signature, not Kenji.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5119_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The final room was devoted to a series of Sakura paintings. Much like most people, I love the aesthetics of Cherry Blossom trees. The pure white/pink petals blooming at the start of the year, representing youth and new beginnings set in front of the dark blackness of trees that have lived longer than any human and refuse to die.</p><p>This series focuses on Yamataka Jindia Zakura, an ugly gross tree that has lived over 2000 years. Kudou mentioned that the tree was not far away, so I went to visit the tree when I left. It's December, so obviously nothing is in bloom, but you can clearly view the skeleton of this monster tree.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251220_kudou/IMG_5260_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Completing the tour of his museum, he showed me his workspace in the former staff meeting room. And he introduced me to his wife, who was studying Persian in the former staff room. At the front desk, I bought two of his books and paid for entry totalling 5000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Entry was 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> and each book was 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. Expensive, but well worth the personalized tour and supporting this amazing artist. </p><p>I also signed his guestbook. Apparently I had been the only visitor since Wednesday.</p><p>This little space he had created in the world was incredible. However, the brilliance seems only matched by the difficulty of getting there. There are no trains. There are no busses (not really). It's located in an absorbed remote village that probably loses half its remaining population each year.</p><p>While they are many pockets of people in the dense mountain forests, I don't think there's anywhere else quite like it in Japan.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Himi Showa Hall" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/himi-showa-hall">Himi Showa Hall</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

For quite a while, I have wanted to hike the mountain again for some updated photos. I remember it being a really easy hike, so I finally pulled the cord and went back on a beautiful and clear mid-November day.</p><p>The hike was almost exactly the same as it was back when I first arrived in Takayama. Here's <a href="/old/v7/juunigatake" title="/juunigatake">my post from 11 years ago</a>.

Taking a left continued up the mountain, and taking a right continued along the edge of the mountain going to some unknown destination. I wonder if there are any abandoned homes or buildings that way. (Actually, the road probably just ends.)</p><p>I went with left path and ascended reaching a road block after 10 minutes.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0330_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Just a few meters down the road, a landslide had covered some of the path. I probably could have driven around or over it, but the real risk is the current part of the road collapsing. According to my notes, the trailhead for the mountain wasn't too far away, so I parked my car and grabbed my camera. I grabbed a bear bell for protection, too. (Although, if a bear showed up, it's not going to care that I have a bell.)</p><p>The trail entrance wasn't too far away. It was around just a few bends of the mountain road. On the edge of one of the bends, was a small, yet clear sign indicating the entrance of the trail.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0555_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The trail left the dirt road and went up into the trees. The trail was completely covered in leaves, but there was a clear break in the trees and twigs which guided me further up and down the side of the mountain.</p><p>About halfway up the trail, it became completely covered in overgrown brush.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0375_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From above, it seemed like there was no organization. Once you entered the brush, each direction looked the same. The brush was about as tall as I was, so I had to crouch walk to keep place with the trail.

The stairs go directly to the summit and observation point. But, there is a less steep option going to the right and circling the summit. </p><p>At the summit, you can see all of Nyukawa, the immediate north-eastern neighborhood of Takayama.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_juunigatake/IMG_0460_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Although today, I really couldn't see much of anything. The sun was setting directly in my eyes and a lot of water vapor was collecting in the air readying for the rain fall that would happen in the next 2 hours.

| October 23, 2025 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p>Last year, I went to Ghibli Park for the first time. I bought the premium Sanpo-pass, so I was able to visit all of the outdoor areas as well as enter the Ghibli Warehouse. The Ghibli Warehouse is very similar to the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, but it is much larger and has more areas to explore. You can also take photos throughout the building. :)</p><p>This year, I went back to Ghibli Park twice in September and October. In September, Zach, Dirk, and I had tickets for a Gyoza festival happening in the same park. This was also the hottest day I had ever experienced in Japan. My dash read 43 or 45 degrees. We walked around to a few areas of Ghibli Park, but didn't have tickets. The second time was in October with Jason, and I had purchased the Mononoke/Witches pass.</p><p>In the time since writing <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-park" title="/ghibli-park">my article last year</a>, purchasing tickets for Ghibli park have become much more convoluted. At the time of purchasing my October tickets, there were 7 or 8 different tiers of tickets. Each of the outside areas was split into their own ticket and each had an up-sell of entering the Ghibli Warehouse. Even though it was weeks after they were available, I could get a ticket that gave entry for the Mononoke Village, Valley of the Witches, and Ghibli Warehouse.</p><p><i>Update Dec 2025</i>: Tickets for Ghibli Park have changed again to become simple like they were before. Now there are only two tiers of tickets available. One ticket that offers entry to all areas of the park. And a second ticket identical to the one I bought for October. It seems like the only way you can enter Hill of Youth and Dondoko Hill is by buying the 7500<span class='ja'>円</span> ticket.</p><p>Even though, we only had tickets for entry in the Valley of the Witches, <b>standby tickets</b> were still available to entry buildings. The premium tickets guarantee entry to these buildings. In the Valley of the Witches, there are 3 buildings: Howl's Moving Castle, the Okino Residence, and The House of the Witches. Howl's Castle sold quickly, but we could visit the two other homes. :) (No photos, though.)</p><p>Our Entry for the Ghibli Warehouse was at 3pm, so after visiting our outside areas, we went inside, watched our movie, and walked around. Our film this time was <a href="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out" title="https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/films/works/#koros_big_day_out">Koro's Big Day Out</a>. At this point, I think I've seen half of the exclusive Museum/Warehouse films.</p><p>I wasn't planning on taking photos, but (1) there was a new area opened in the Warehouse compared to last time, (2) at the end of the day, big lines for photo opportunities were really short, and (3) also it was generally not so crowded allowing for more photos elsewhere. So, below, you can take a look of the photos, and compare them with <a href="/old/v7/ghibli-warehouse" title="/ghibli-warehouse">my Warehouse photos from last year.</a><br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Hida no Sato Fall Illumination" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/hida-no-sato-fall-illumination">Hida no Sato Fall Illumination</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

All of these homes were transported from their original locations around Hida Takayama into this village located at the base of the Matsukura mountain. Throughout the year, you can view the old classic homes with some beautiful scenery in each of the four seasons.</p><p>From October 11th to November 9th this year and only on the weekends, you can enter the museum at night and view the homes and the scenery lit up. Only the areas near the central pond were illuminated, so you couldn't view everything in the village. All of the areas away from the center were pitch black and roped off.</p><p>A friend from college, Jason, visited Takayama, and we showed up right as entry for the night illumination began. We got there early enough that the sun had not fully set, and we could easily go in a couple of the homes.

Once you reach the turn-off from the main road, it takes over 30 minutes of driving on a narrow single lane road through the forest and along valley cliffs to reach the remote buildings. It's deep enough in the forest that cellphone reception is hard to come by.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The purpose of the inn is to relax with nature while shedding the modern conveniences of the Internet and electricity. To become less digital and more analogue. There are very few lights at Doai Onsen and after 10pm, the generator is turned off. The hallways and rooms are only illuminated by lantern at that point, of which there are more than 300 at the inn in various styles. The numerous amount of lanterns have become the mascot of Doai Onsen, so Doai is also known as the Lamp Inn <span class='ja'>ランプの宿</span></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I found this place while searching around on Google Maps looking for places to hike and explore, and with my friends Dirk and Zach coming to visit in September, we decided to give it a try and stay a night. They have a very modern website which made it easy to reserve a room and the prices were very good compared to other expensive onsens and ryokans. Only 15000<span class='ja'>円</span> (~$100) a night, which includes dinner and breakfast.</p><p>After an obnoxious lunch, we arrived around 4pm. There was a bit of confusion on when we were supposed to arrive, but it all worked out. Check-in official began at 3pm, but we could still arive by 5pm. We were sharing the inn with 2 other groups. One group was just a mother and son. The other group was a larger older family of about 6 people. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The inn seemed like the perfect size for our 3 groups. I don't know if any of the rooms had names, but we were given the room nearest to the entrance. There were two connected tatami rooms that were opened up so we had a really large space, a total of 20 tatami mats!  The group of 6 had the whole lower wing to themselves, so they probably had probably double the space.</p><p>While some others had already arrived, we were able to hop in the baths first and have them to ourselves before the other groups. Dinner was served around 6:15pm (later than usual), so there was a lot of time to soak.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were separated baths for men and women which alternated in the night and morning. The men had the larger bath in the evening. The baths are kept warm from a wood burning stove underneath, known as the Goemon method. However, heated water from the tap is boiled using electricity from the generator.</p><p>There were two baths available. Both were filled with spring water from the mountain. One was full of water that was naturally heated by the thermals of the mountain. The other was from cool spring water that was manually heated. Both contain the natural minerals that onsen in the mountains are known for, such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, essentially). These baths repair and soothe rough skin and cuts by eating away at dead skin on the surface.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I love sitting in the warm baths. Natural onsens are my favorite. :) The open window looked out over the gorge with the Tsukechi river below. There were the 3 of us in the bath, so we were talking about things. But, it is always nice to just sit in the bath and listen the wind blow through the leaves and the water flow through the river. There were hot and cold taps for the baths, so I could douse myself with cold water when I felt I was getting too hot.</p><p>It was still pretty early out, but it would've been really nice to come back after the sunset and soak in the tub only lit by lantern light. The lanterns keep the insects away, so you could just relax.</p><p>We stayed in the baths for about 40 minutes and were leaving just as the next group came in. We goofed around in the room for about an hour until the hostess notified everyone of dinner.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The dinner was incredible. Often when dinner is served at an enkai or ryokan, there is usually not enough (for me) to go around. I'm always leave feeling unsatisfied and that I could've had more. This was not the case at Doai. The meal began with mountain vegetables <span class='ja'>山菜</span>, tofu, mochi, and some Iwana sashimi. Iwana is the most common and prevalent fish in the rivers of these moutanins, and local restaurants often serve it.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>More and more dishes kept coming out. We had baked Iwana, tempura, and a very large Gohei mochi. Gohei mochi <span class='ja'>五平餅</span> is fried mochi on a stick with a sweet syrup sauce painted on the top. They are usually the size of a popsicle, but this beast was larger than most pancakes. It was so good.</p><p>It was an amazing meal with so much delicious food. One of the best meals I've had in a while.</p><p>With dinner finished, we had the lamp and safety demonstration at 7:30pm. I thought that this would take only a couple of minutes so I could be back in the onsen bath before they closed, but the lamp demonstration was only the beginning of the night's activities.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Arriving in the common area, we were given a puzzle, a wooden needle threaded in a denim jacket. "Remove the needle from the jacket and get a prize!" It seemed pretty easy and I remember seeing a similar looking puzzle on YouTube a while ago where a person removed a bike lock from a lamp post. That was a different solve, though.</p><p>We fumbled around at the puzzle until everyone arrived and began the lamp demonstration. The host explained how to correctly light the lamp by achieving the correct flame size after lighting the wick with a match. The two sides of the flame should create an arch when holding the glass above the flame, creating an image that kinda looks like Batman. If the flame is too intense, there's too much wick. The reverse is true too.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" /></a></p><p>He also mentioned that because the wick is completely soaked in oil, it never burns itself. The wick isn't like the wick of a candle. If the flame dies down, it's because of the oil running low, not because the wick is too low. As such, you should never push too much of the wick out of the base. In the short term, you might get the light you want, but after an hour there will be a massive flame burning out of the lantern. ALWAYS make sure the initial lighting creates the batman shape, and the lantern will be fine for the whole night.</p><p>Also, when you want to extinguish the flame, don't mess with the wick. Simply blow over the top of the glass and the air circulation will put out the light.</p><p>We were each given our own lantern to light the correct way. The wicks were already in the best position, so we didn't have to mess with it. After striking our match and lighting the wick, we just observed the flame's shape to verify it was correct.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Then, continuing with lighting lanterns, he had us lighting the lamps using the arcane method of flint and steel, the same way his Japanese ancestors like lanterns. We started off with a standard cut of steel against stones. But, if we couldn't handle it, we could use easier steel which guaranteed sparks. Every strike on the flint should try and knock the sparks into some padded cloth, and then attempt to transfer the spark into the lantern to light it.</p><p>It was not so easy. I could not get the right angle or I was holding it too hard. I moved on to the easy steel and sparks were flying immediately. Lighting the lantern was so much easier using the "starter" steel. Zach and Dirk were much better at using the true steel method.</p><p>Moving on from the lantern, there were many more activities. We continued with the wooden thread puzzle, and he continued to give us more and more hints until we understood how to solve it. Upon solving it, we could keep the wooden needle and as a prize, we were given an extra one to give to a friend.

It is funded by the Mahikari, a religious group (cult) whose branch of the religion (Sukyo Mahikari) has their headquarters in Takayama. Through donations, they have become incredibly rich allowing them to build incredibly gaudy buildings in Takayama. One of which is the Hikaru Museum. Gaudy yes, but really impressive on the inside.</p><p>The Hikaru Museum has an outside facade of a pyramid. Inside, the pyramid is completely hollow with its open area following the contours of the pyramid. There are three main levels of the pyramid and each level has several exhibition halls.</p><p>The bottom floor has special exhibition halls with rotating exhibits. For Fall 2025, these exhibits were the Hokusai Ukiyoe exhibit, the Serizawa Keisuke exhibit, and an exhibit called Pissarro, which seemed to be some guy's collection of classic European art.  The next floor up had established exhibits which focused on civilization's history in the world, Japan, and Hida. And the top floor had a calligraphy exhibit (which was extra) and some other exhibits that were being renovated. You could also go outside and view the top of the pyramid.</p><p>Despite being funded by a cult and having incredibly odd architecture for Japan, the museum was really impressive. </p><p>Entry was only 1000<span class='ja'>円</span> with a year pass set at 2000<span class='ja'>円</span>. I entered the museum for the first time this year when Zach and Dirk visited. And I went again when Jason visited a month later. Maybe I should have bought the year pass, so I could attend some special events whenever those happen.

One important part of this history was the postal service. </p><p>Until 1970, especially in the winter, because of the large amounts of winter mountain snow, mail was still carried by hand. Carriers of Johana Town would bring the mail to the Hosoo Postal Exchange where they would meet carriers from Taira Village. Both teams left at 9am and met around 1pm. They would exchange their packages and letters. Then, they'd go back down the mountain to their post offices. These folks were known as the Postal Corps <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span>.</p><p>The <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins" title="/hosoo-pass-postal-station-ruins">Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office</a> <span class='ja'>細尾峠郵便交換所</span> was one of the places I visited when I explored Hosoo Pass. I went there on June 3rd. It turns out that just a days prior on May 31st, they held a dedication ceremony for the creation of a monument devoted to the Taira Postal Corps in Taira Village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0982_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument details the history of the Postal Corps and includes 3 photos taken in the 1960s. There are a few individual credits on the back of the monument. The <span class='ja'>郵送隊之碑</span> calligraphy was done by Fumio Yamamoto <span class='ja'>山本文雄</span>. And the 3 photos were taken by Toshio Takada <span class='ja'>高田</span> <span class='ja'>俊夫</span>, Shinobu Soga <span class='ja'>曽我忍</span>, and Tsutomu Takada <span class='ja'>高田勉</span>.</p><p>The May 31st ceremoney was held by the mayor, the chairs of the commeration committee, and Shinobu Soga, one of the men who took a photo of the Postal Corps. The Yomiuri Newspaper wrote <a href="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/" title="https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/local/toyama/news/20250612-OYTNT50193/">an article about it</a>. In the article, it mentions how Soga was a location scout for a film studio in Kyoto and came to Gokayama looking for locations. He learned of the Postal Corps and wanted to travel with them and learn more.</p><p>In the end, he could get some amazing unique photos of the team. Of the three photos on the monument, I think this one was his.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0987_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0988_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the other photos shows the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office in the 60s in winter. Having been there a few weeks prior, they apparently made an addition to the building sometime in the 60s. The plaque in the Postal Exchange Office mentioned that mail increased significantly in the 60s because of economic reform. The Postal Corps chain would somtimes include up to 30 members. So, I suppose they needed the extra space for the package exchange.</p><p>Here's a <a href="/old/v7/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="/hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information">transcription and translation</a> of the plaque at the Postal Exchange office in the woods in the mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8215_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plaque on the monument gives a brief history of the Postal Corps. Here's a transcription and translation of the contents:</p><p><span class='ja'>かって、冬期間積雪により交通機関が断され</span> <span class='ja'>陸の孤島と化していた越中五箇山の人々に</span> <span class='ja'>文化の火をもたらす役割を果たたのが</span> <span class='ja'>郵便遞送隊</span>(<span class='ja'>通称</span> <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span>)<span class='ja'>でした。</span> <span class='ja'>当時、平・城端両郵便局では請負人を雇用隊を編成して標高七四〇</span>m<span class='ja'>の細尾峠近くに設けられた郵便交換所まで背負って運び渡していました。</span></p><p>The Postal Transport Corps (commonly known as the Postal Corps) played a role in bringing a firey culture to the people of Etchu Gokayama, who were once isolated village islands in the winter when transportation was cut off due to snowfall. At that time, the Taira and Johana Post Offices organized contractors into teams to carry mail on their backs to the postal exchange office located near Hosoo Pass, 740 meters above sea level.</p><p><span class='ja'>明治十五年下梨郵便局</span>(<span class='ja'>現平局</span>)<span class='ja'>開設されて以来、城端局と片道約二〇</span>km<span class='ja'>の峠山道を徒歩で往復していました。昭和十年長い間続いた直送を廃し、両局の中程に位置する細尾峠で郵袋を交換する方法なりました。その後、バスの開通に伴い通常期はバス託送に改め、昭和三十年から請負による交換便は冬期に限られることになりました。深雪・吹雪の中隊員苦労は想像を絶するものでした。</span></p><p>Since Shimonashi Post Office (now Taira Post Office) was opened in 1882, mail was sent back and forth between Johana Post Office on foot along the mountain pass, about 20km one-way**. In 1935, the long-running direct delivery system was discontinued, as the method of mail exchange was changed to bus delivery at Hosoo Pass, located between the two offices. After that, the normal period was changed to bus delivery, and from 1955, the contracted exchange service was limited to winter. The hardships faced by the members of the Postal Corps in the deep snow and blizzards were unimaginable.</p><p>(**note: The monument says one-way, but it's only 10 km one-way. It's 20 km round trip.)</p><p><span class='ja'>時代と共に、請負人の雇用難・雪崩危険等に鑑み、昭和四十五年八十八年間に渡る郵送隊のの歴史を閉じました。その後冬期は庄川の船便等を利用する輸送となり昭和五十九年</span>,<span class='ja'>国道三〇四号線に五箇山トンネルが開通したことにより、専用自動車便が通年運行され、現在に至っています。</span></p><p>As times changed, the Postal Corps came to an end after 88 years of operation in 1970, due to the difficulty of finding contractors and the risk of avalanches. After that, transportation in the winter was changed to ship services on the Shogawa River. In 1984, the Gokayama Tunnel was opened on National Route 304, and dedicated automobile services began to operate year-round, which continues to this day.</p><p><span class='ja'>郵送隊の大きな功績は</span><br/>The Great Achievements of the Postal Corps</p><p><span class='ja'>・厳冬の雪深い峠道を人力で郵便物</span>(<span class='ja'>生活必需品</span>)<span class='ja'>を運び地域住民の暮らしを支えた。</span><br/>- They carried mail (a daily necessity) by hand through snowy mountain passes in the harsh winter, supporting the lives of local residents.</p><p><span class='ja'>・隊員の大半は主婦で女性の忍耐と献身性が特筆される。</span><br/>- Most of the members were housewives, and the perserverance and dedication of women is particulary noteworthy.</p><p><span class='ja'>・郵便局では</span> <span class='ja'>地域への奉仕・貢献の原点として語り継がれている。</span><br/>- At the post office, it is passed down as the origin of service and contribution to the community.</p><p><span class='ja'>ここにその功績を称え</span> <span class='ja'>史実を後世に伝えるものです。</span><br/>Here, we commemorate their achievements and pass on the historical facts to future generations.</p><p><span class='ja'>令和七年五月</span> - May 2025<br/><span class='ja'>郵送隊を称える会</span> - The Postal Corps Commemoration Committee</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_0996_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The monument is a great way of commemorating such a unique service in the area. But, the monument is a little sad. They placed the monument at the location of the original Shimonashi Post Office from 50 years ago, but that building has moved since then. Now, there's only houses and an open field next to it.</p><p>The current Taira Post Office is just down the street.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250628_04_postal/IMG_1031_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, it's a pretty amazing coincidence that I started exploring and researching about this stuff at the same time this monument was created. Many of these remote rural areas of Japan have their own unique stories, and many of those stories have been immortalized on monuments.<br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (39)
