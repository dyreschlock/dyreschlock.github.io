People living in these villages were largely cut off from the main Japanese society. One of the main transportation routes was along the Sho River <span class='ja'>庄川</span>, but the river only went through mountains in the north. A whole range of mountains encircled the southern end of Johana shielding the town from the valley.</p><p>So, the old Hosoo Pass route was established in 1887 (Meiji 20). It was fairly direct ascent up the mountains, but the road twisted enough that it was smooth travel for people and easy for horses, too. This 10 kilometer route was far more convenient than the 40 kilometer detour north following the river.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7758_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Halfway through the road, at the top of Hosoo Pass, you can clearly see Johana Town and the rest of the Takaoka and Tonami area.</p><p>These days that old route is no longer used. In 1927 (Showa 2), the Yahata Road <span class='ja'>八幡道路</span> was completed. It was a paved road that went directly from Johana Town, through Hosoo Pass, and continued to the Taira and Kamitaira villages before ending in Shimonashi village on Sho River. Part of this new road was the Hosoo Pass tunnel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7665_t.webp" /></a></p><p>On the southern end of Hosoo Pass, continuing to Taira and Shimonashi villages, the old route went over Kakuma Pass <span class='ja'>鹿熊峠</span>, but in 1973, the Nashitani Tunnel <span class='ja'>梨谷トンネル</span> was completed which decommisioned that part of the route. In 1979, construction on the Gokayama Tunnel <span class='ja'>五箇山トンネル</span> began and finished in 1981. The tunnel went directly through the mountains and connected with the Nashitani Tunnel. Yahata Road going through Hosoo Pass was no longer necessary.</p><p>The road is still usable today despite the occassional fallen rocks and branches from the cliffs above. Old folks still drive along the road and clear the debris. Enough preventions have been set to prevent landslides, but eventually there could be a large enough landslide to knock out the road, rendering Hosoo Pass no longer travelable from the north.</p><div class='title'><b>Adventure</b></div><p>A few weeks ago, I traveled to Hosoo Pass. At the time, I knew nothing about the area, so I followed Google Map's suggestions, which lead me to several closed roads, taking too much time, and forcing me to return a few days later. That's the day that I went to that <a href="donohara-winter-branch-school" title="donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School</a>. That branch school was along the Sho River to the north of Shimonashi village.</p><p>On my second trip, I left my house early at 6:30am and arrived at Hosoo Pass around 8am, an hour by highway and 30 minutes on mountain roads. Before exploring the rest of Hosoo Pass and Yahata Road, I took the side path next to Hosoo Tunnel to climb Hakamagoshiyama. I detailed that hike in a <a href="hakamagoshiyama" title="hakamagoshiyama">different post</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Hosoo Pass Tea House Ruins <span class='ja'>細尾峠の茶屋</span></b></div><p>Today it's no longer a spectacle, but next to Hosoo Tunnel was a two story Tea House.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7714_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now all that remains are 7 metal posts sticking out of the ground and a bunch of metal garbage behind them. Much of that metal garbage is the old aluminum roof of the building. There was also a refrigerator back there, and a few other things.</p><p>I have no idea when the tea house was built, but it apparently had no running water, nor any electricity of its own. For those people who traveled along the old route in the Meiji and early Showa periods, this had to have been used as a rest stop in the middle of the journey from Johana to Taira or Shimonashi. Later, after it closed, construction companies used it as an office and warehouse.</p><p>Looking around the Internet, I found a webpage that had a photo of the tea house in the year 2001. I copied the page and <a href="/pages/hosoo.html" title="/pages/hosoo.html">hosted it here</a> as a backup. You could clearly see the 7 white metal posts holding up the front of the building, but many of the windows have been broken out, and the building doesn't look very safe.</p><p>I found some other photos other sites, too. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/IMG_60171.webp">Here's a photo</a> of less than half of the building remaining from around 2005, I think. And then another <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/20190906133106.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosoo/20190906133106.webp">photo from 2019</a> of a more distinct pile of rubble.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8049_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now, there is so little left. I think, year after year, snow melt continued to push and move the garbage away from the site and down the mountain.</p><div class='title'><b>Hosoo Postal Exchange Ruins <span class='ja'>細尾峠郵便交換所</span></b></div><p>A few hundred meters away from the tunnel and tea house is the ruins of the Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange office. Finding this building is not very easy. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8059_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Yahata Road curves along the rim of the mountain and has a steep drop off. There's a 3-meter drop to the ground from the road, and the ground is angled at 45 degrees. But apparently there's a trail down there which was the old Hosoo Pass route. Google Maps doesn't mark any kind of entry, but the OSM maps had a trail. And at those coordinates, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_7690.webp">I found a rope</a>. The rope trails trials off into the brush going nearly straight down.</p><p>On my first trip, I did not believe that was the entry point, but I confirmed it later at home. When I came back on the weekend, I put on my worker gloves and scaled down to ground. The trail apparently hugs the road and then shoots off along the ridge of the mountain. </p><p>When there's no clear indication of a trail and you're cutting through brush, it's hard to tell if you're going the right way. I naturally followed the downward slope of the mountain, but then remembered this was not the way. I climbed up a bit, using the plants as handles and found a flattened spot.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8062_t.webp" /></a></p><p>As I headed in the direction that seemed correct, I noticed a red flag on a tree. Okay, I am actually going the right way.</p><p>Most of the trail was completely covered in brush, but there were the occassional stone and cement bricks along the path. The trail did hug the road for a little bit before heading off in the direction of the mountain ridge.</p><p>And after 10 or 15 minutes, the ruins poked through the brush in front of me.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8068_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8070_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Inside the ruins was a large painted board that detailed the history of Hosoo Pass and the Post Office. I transcribed the board and put a translation <a href="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information" title="hosoo-postal-exchange-ruins-information">on this page</a>.</p><p>When the Taira Post Office was established in Shimonashi in 1872 (Meiji 5), the Postal Corps <span class='ja'>郵送隊</span> was also established. The Postal Corps was a group of people who lived in the villages of Taira and Shimonashi. This group of people would gather all the mail for the day and physically hike up to Hosoo Pass and down to Johana. They would collect the mail at Johana, and then return to Taira Post Office. Each person carried a maximum of 18 kilograms of mail and packages. </p><p>They did this 20 kilometer round trip every day, even in winter. When the traveled the formed a line of people. Sometimes in winter, blizzards would be so strong that it was difficult for the mail carriers to see the next person in front of them. They constantly had to sound off to make sure no one was left behind.</p><p>A few years later in 1887, the old Hosoo Pass route opened which made this travel must easier and faster. Again, in 1927 the paved road, Yahata Road, was opened which made travel more convenient in summer, and now mail could be transported by trucks. But the Postal Corps still transported the mail by foot in winter.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8181_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In 1945, ths Hosoo Pass Postal Exchange Office was built. Now, the Postal Corps had two teams. Both teams who would leave Taira and Johana post offices at 9am and meet here. Parcels and Mail would be exchanged between both teams. And then, they'd return to their towns. This cut travel time in half, but required more workers.</p><p>In 1955, as Japan experienced significant economic growth, many temporary workers were hired to match the workload. However, by 1971, the villages of Taira, Ueda, and all the areas around Shimonashi experienced significant depopulation. The current members of the corps were aging, and young people moved away to live in larger cities. The postal corps was abolished that year.</p><p>And again, the Nashitani and Gokayama tunnels were completed in 1973 and 1981, which made the road obsolete.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8120_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The brickwork and cement structure is still holding after 80 years, but all of the metalwork has rusted, and the roof of the office building has collapsed. Part of the roof still protects the signboard from the weather, though.</p><p>I took a few more pictures and then returned to the road. Out of the entrance to the Postal Exchange, the old route branches up and down the mountain. I wasn't paying close attention, but I managed to go the right way.</p><p>Moving along the ridge of the mountain, I came to the area underneath the paved road. The old route snaked along with the road until it came to that 3-meter drop off with the rope. But, I figured that I could just ascend anywhere that seemed easy enough to reach the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8228_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, this looked like a good spot. I grabbed the trees and climbed up. With each step, I grabbed the next bit of plants coming out of the ground. Often I would lose my footing and slip down, but I was able to keep advancing and pulling myself up. Inch by inch, I finally saw the outline of the road and had my exit in front of me.</p><p>I moved along the 3-meter drop off until some plants were high enough to vault me up to a guardrail pipe and then I yanked myself up onto the road.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8234_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Maybe I should have shimmied along the road back to the rope, but I was back to civilization, and back on easy street. I returned to my car and continued down towards Johana to meet the Gokayama Tunnel.</p><p>The road continued to snake along the edge of the mountain. Occassionally I would have to squeak my car to the side to let another car pass. Lots of people were using the road today.

A small stream was flowing over part of it, so I thought it was a hydroelectric plant, using the natural spring of the mountain for power. There was an occassional whirring sound, too, which I thought it was a turbine or some kind of internal machinery.</p><p>The northern side of the structure had plastic windows, several of which were broken. I took a look inside, and a car whizzed by! Ah... I checked the map. This was part of the Gokayama tunnel.</p><p>Back at the large square garage-looking door, one of the emergency exits was not locked, and I could go inside.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8338_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was about a kilometer into the 3km tunnel. The road wasn't super busy, but cars whizzed by every minute or so. Next to the emergency exit was an SOS phone. Wikipedia mentions that the Gokayama tunnel was built in two parts, so maybe this was the half point of its construction.</p><p>I took some photos, and then returned to my car. I continued to the end of Yahata Road, next to the mouth of the tunnel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8394_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There was some weird art structure nearby, but this was the end of Yahata Road.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakaide <span class='ja'>坂出</span></b></div><p>After 6 hours of hiking and driving around the old road, I went to Shimonashi for lunch. Sakaide was a small family owned restaurant in the center of Shimonashi village. They had the standard dishes of Udon, Soba, and Rice Bowls.</p><p>On the menu, I noticed that they served bear meat in their dishes, so I ordered the Bear Meat Soba, or <span class='ja'>くま肉そば</span>.</p><p>The soba was great, although soba is always great. I don't know how it stood apart from other soba I've had before. In the soba were chunks of cooked bear meat. It also wasn't really remarkable. They tasted like cuts of beef. It was good, but I think buying the mountain vegetable soba <span class='ja'>山菜そば</span> would've probably been better. Either way, it was exactly the meal I wanted for lunch. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250607_hosoo/IMG_8437_t.webp" /></a></p><p>When driving down the highways and motorways of Japan, there are so many side roads that go off along mountains or continue into forests. I have driven past hundreds of these roads and barely given a thought to where they lead.</p><p>Much like this case, they are often the original old roads that snaked around the mountain before tunnels were built. Also, these roads traveled to villages that once were and are no longer.</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline of the Adventure</b></div><table>    <tr><td>6:30ish</td><td></td><td>Left Home</td></tr>    <tr><td>8:00am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Arrived at Hosoo Pass Tunnel</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4474912,136.8967591">36°26'51.0"N 136°53'48.4"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>8:25am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td><a href="/old/v7/hakamagoshiyama" title="/hakamagoshiyama">Hiking Hakamagoshiyama</a></td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4317188,136.8799013">36°25'54.3"N 136°52'47.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:00am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4323459,136.880427">36°25'56.6"N 136°52'49.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:15am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Tea House Ruins</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035">36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:30am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>(Jumping down the cliff)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4489325,136.9003997">36°26'56.2"N 136°54'01.4"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>10:45am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Finding the Post Office</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4510614,136.9000417">36°27'03.9"N 136°54'00.2"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:05am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Leaving the Post Office</td><td></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:15am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Climbing to the Road</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4498593,136.9010224">36°26'59.7"N 136°54'03.8"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:25am</td><td>walking <span class='ja'>歩く</span></td><td>Back to Car</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.448049,136.8977035">36°26'53.1"N 136°53'51.9"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>11:50am</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Highway Emergency Exit</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4604666,136.910906">36°27'37.7"N 136°54'39.3"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>12:15pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Back to the Main Highway</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4649974,136.9032231">36°27'54.0"N 136°54'11.7"E</a></td></tr>    <tr><td>12:30pm</td><td>by car <span class='ja'>車</span></td><td>Sakaide <span class='ja'>坂出</span> (for lunch)</td><td><a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503" title="http://google.com/maps/place/36.4331262,136.9485503">36°25'59.3"N 136°56'54.8"E</a></td></tr></table><br/></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/donohara-winter-branch-school">Donohara Winter Branch School 渡原冬季分校</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It apparently closed in 1972, but it was never torn down. The building has stayed abandoned since then, and the local farmers even repurposed it for storage of their farming equipment.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7572_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Now, nature has completely reclaimed the wooden building with trees and vines choking the remains of the structure. The front of the building is surrounded with tall grass, difficult to move through. The entrance to the school is completely shut from vines. The back of the building has tall trees towering over it. Bamboo trees also surround the old school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7488_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From certain angles, it's hard to tell there's even a building back there. Apparently later on in summer, the plants grow so high that you can't even reach it. Right now it's only the beginning of June, and already it's a bit difficult getting to the actual building.</p><p>It's a lot easier to move around the back of the building. The tree canopy prevents any of the grass growing. But, the back reveals that the building is in much worse shape.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7539_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The south end of the roof has collapsed, probably from the weight of winter snow. As the roof collapsed, it took the second floor, staircase, and back wall with it. Much of the electrical wiring of the building is now exposed.</p><p>Looking at the wood work around the building, it seemed like the local farmers adding a bunch of bracing and other wooden beams to keep the building together. But, a lot of the wood looks like it's been chewed through by termites. Even though the nearby fields look like someone has still been using them, no one has seemed to touch this building recently at all.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7520_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The school building looks like it had 4 rooms. The main room in the above photo was probably the office. The room leading off to the right was mostly likely the classroom. Then, there was a store room to right in the photo above, about the size of a closet. And lastly, a staircase that went up to another room. I don't know what they would've used that for.</p><p>According to folks on the Internet, the building finished construction in 1957, and in 1959, it serviced only 8 students, the children of the people living in this small farming plateau. 10 years later in 1969, there were only 4 students. It apparently closed in 1972.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7549_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going back to the full title of this building, it's the Former Higashinakae Elementary - Sugio Branch - Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>旧東中江小学校杉尾分校渡原冬季分校</span>.</p><p>In 1999, Higashinakae Elementary School <span class='ja'>平村立東中江小学校</span> merged with nearby school Shimonashi Elementary School <span class='ja'>下梨小学校</span>. Both schools were part of Taira Village <span class='ja'>平村</span> at the time, and the new school was named Taira Elementary School <span class='ja'>平小学校</span>. This school used the Shimonashi ES building, so the Higashinakae building was no longer used.</p><p>Side tangent, but in 2004, due to depopulation, Toyama (and many other prefectures at the time) restructured many of its outlying villages and municipalities into larger cities. Taira village joined the other south western villages together into Nanto City. In 2006, Taira Elementary was closed, but the building is still used every day as the administrative building for the residents. It also has the post office, a clinic, and a few stores, too.</p><p>Anyways, back in the day, many of the schools (especially elementary schools) in remote areas had branch schools. Branch schools were mainly used in winter when traveling was difficult. It was much easier for a teacher or two to travel and stay there for a week, rather than the students of the area traveling to the main school building every day.</p><p>The Sugio Branch School <span class='ja'>杉尾分校</span> was in the Sugio neighborhood area further north down the river. The Donohara neighborhood was between Sugio and Higashinakae, and apparently it was too far for those 8 students to go to either school, so the Donohara Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>渡原冬季分校</span> was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7596_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The tiny area of Donohara is a plataeu above the main road going along the river down to the main Nanto City. Getting to this small area isn't too bad with my Kei car, but I'm not quite sure how a 1950s bus could safely get up here. Maybe they used a smaller bus to navigate the narrow winding road? Or maybe the students just met the bus at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>The narrow road leading to Donohara overlooks the Owatari Bridge <span class='ja'>大渡橋</span>, which was opened in 1958, only a year after the Winter Branch School was built.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250604_school/IMG_7603_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Obviously in summer it's pretty easy to move around, but in winter, I imagine they probably don't even plow this narrow road.</p><p>Looking through photos from just a few years ago, I think the damage to the school building is very recent. Maybe it happened this winter? I wonder how much longer until they completely remove the building. Although, it's remote enough that it'll probably stay until it becomes an actual hazard, or someone buys the land.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Japan Travel Map Page" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/japan-travel-map-page">Japan Travel Map Page</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I love discovering and learning about new and interesting places and their history. I have lived here for over 12 years now, but it's been almost 19 years since I first came here and became inspired to explore, take photos, and research.</p><p>Recently, I have been going through a lot of old unsorted, unprocessed photos and unfinished posts of travels. With nearly 200 posts talking about Japanese travel and locations, I wanted to see all these locations on a map. Through doing research about some locations, I found an open source JavaScript mapping library called <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>, and I've added a page with all these links pinned on a map.</p><p>Use the following link to view the <a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map">Japan Travel Map</a> page.</p><p class='img'><a href="/old/v7/map" title="/map"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250501_map/map_screen_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Travel Page is a little bit of a work-in-progress at the moment, so the styles and features may be updated or changed in the future.</p><p>I learned about Leaflet from visiting <a href="https://haikyo.info/" title="https://haikyo.info/">Haikyo.info</a>. This site is a collection of abandoned places around Japan and whether or not its possible to trespass and explore. I came across the site when trying to find information about the <a href="/old/v7/red-factory" title="/red-factory">Red Factory</a>, an old abandoned factory which was highly rated among ruins explorers. </p><p>Leaflet has been super easy to use. Going through their <a href="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html" title="https://leafletjs.com/examples.html">Tutorials</a>, their quick start guide puts a map on a webpage almost immediately. Plotting points is incredibly simple, too, once you get the geo coordinates. It gets a little more complicated when you want to use layers to filter certain points on the map, but it was really just an extra step. You can take a look at the code, but there's not a whole lot of special things going on underneath.</p><p>By the way, the Red Factory is one post in a series of posts from 2016 when my friends Fishy and Chaos came to visit. These posts have their own <a href="/keyword/fishy-chaos" title="/keyword/fishy-chaos">keyword</a>, so you can view all 8 of the posts from there.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Battle of Sekigahara 関ヶ原の戦い" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/battle-of-sekigahara">Battle of Sekigahara 関ヶ原の戦い</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It was fought between the Western Army led by Ishida Mitsunari on behalf of the newly established somewhat traditional government of Japan, and Tokugawa Ieyasu who considered Japan weak to outsiders and wanted to establish a new government. Tokugawa won the battle, and after establishing a new government brought forth 250 years of peace and prosperity. This stability led to a sharp increase in population, education, and overall wellbeing.</p><p>The battle happened on October 21st, 1600.</p><div class='title'><b>Leading to the Battle</b></div><p>In the 1500s, Japan was in chaos. The time is referred to the Warring States period, or Sengoku-jidai <span class='ja'>戦国時代</span>. It's called this because Japan was in a constant state of civil war. In 1573, Oda Nobunaga led his army to the capital and overthrew reigning Shogun, Ashikaga Yoshiaki. From there, his army spread out conquering the nearby kingdoms.</p><p>In the middle of his conquest, he was betrayed and committed seppuku rather than be captured. This was in 1582. He was succeded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi who continued the conquest, and brought all of Japan together as a single kingdom by 1592. He restored power to the emperor, but he was really the one in charge. In 1593, his second son was born, and planned on succeded him as grand regeant to the emperor.</p><p>Toyotomi died in 1598 leaving behind his 5-year-old son, and a council of regeants to teach and advise him until he was old enough to assume his position. This is where the TV show and novel <b>Shogun</b> begins. Immediately after his death, the Council of Five Regeants begin scheming and allying to seize control of Japan for themselves.</p><div class='title'><b>Shogun and The Council of Five</b></div><p>The Shogun TV show is slightly different than history, and of course all the names have been changed. The Council of Five had the following members: <b>Tokugawa</b> Ieyasu <span class='ja'>徳川家康</span>, <b>Ukita</b> Hideie <span class='ja'>宇喜多秀家</span>, <b>Maeda</b> Toshiie <span class='ja'>前田利家</span>, <b>Uesugi</b> Kagekatsu <span class='ja'>上杉景勝</span>, and <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span>. Mori only became a member of the council because of his uncle's death a year prior. His uncle was <b>Kobayakawa</b> Takakage <span class='ja'>小早川隆景</span>, who is sometimes considered an honorary member of The Council.</p><p>Almost immediately after Toyotomi's death, Tokugawa began a series of marriage pacts and campaigns to secure his family, despite it being forbidden by the council laws. Maeda was said to have been part of this conspiracy. <b>Ishida</b> Mitsunari <span class='ja'>石田三成</span> was one of the highest level bureacrats in Toyotomi's government. He considered Tokugawa's action a complete insult to Toyotomi's legacy and quickly aligned himself with Ukita, Mori, and Uesugi. He also had powerful friendships with <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span> and <b>Shima</b> Sakon <span class='ja'>島清興</span>. </p><p>While Ishida gained the support of many lords of western kingdoms, Tokugawa gained support from the east. One of his strongest allies was <b>Kuroda</b> Nagamasa <span class='ja'>黒田長政</span>, who was perhaps the best military strategist in Japan at that time. He was the chief strategist for Toyotomi. Ishida apparently loathed and often insulted the military commanders, so Kuroda and six other commanders planned to assassinate him. Tokugawa actually quelled their attempt, and later recruited all of them in his Eastern Army.</p><p>Several skermishes in the east and west pulled the armies together as they met in Sekigahara on October 21, 1600.</p><div class='title'><b>The Battle Stage</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/20250322_sekigahara_t.webp" /></a></p><p>In the morning of the battle, a thick fog covered Sekigahara. No one could see more than a few meters in front of them. But with the sunrise, the fog had disspated by around 8am and all the armies could see their opponents.</p><p>The Eastern Army led by <b>Tokugawa</b> is red. They created a "fish scale" battle pattern with the main forces creating a line directly opposing the Western Army. <b>Kuroda</b> <span class='ja'>黒田</span> and <b>Takenaka</b> <span class='ja'>竹中</span> positioned themselves on Okayama hill <span class='ja'>岡山</span> in the north overlooking the battlefield. <b>Fukushima</b> <span class='ja'>福島</span> led the main force on the frontline poised to strike first.</p><p>The Western Army is mainly blue, but also consists of the yellow and green armies at the start of the battle. They are multi-colored because of some key moments in the battle which led to their defeat. The main force was led by <b>Ukita</b> <span class='ja'>宇喜多</span>, one of the Five Regeants. <b>Ishida</b> <span class='ja'>石田</span> positioned himself with <b>Shima</b> <span class='ja'>島</span> at the most northern on the army line on Sasaoyama <span class='ja'>笹尾山</span>. Colored in blue, the furthest south is <b>Otani</b> <span class='ja'>大谷</span>, Ishida's other close friend. But, the largest army on the southern end of the west army was <b>Kobayakawa</b> <span class='ja'>小早川</span>, colored in yellow.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, the Western Army had around 82,000 soldiers compared to the Eastern Army's 88,888. Fearing Ishida's defeat, several lords who pledged support for Ishida did not attend the battle.</p><div class='title'><b>The Battle Begins</b></div><p>As the fog cleared, it is said that <b>Ii</b> Naomasa <span class='ja'>井伊直政</span> and <b>Matsudaira</b> Tadayoshi <span class='ja'>松平忠吉</span> of the Eastern Army ordered their gunmen to take aim and fire on <b>Ukita's</b> army. <b>Fukushima</b> <span class='ja'>福島</span>, frontline battle commander of the Eastern Army and who was promised first-attack by Tokugawa, became enraged and ordered his whole army to quickly join the fight against <b>Ukita</b>. From Okayama Hill, <b>Kuroda</b> <span class='ja'>黒田</span> noticed that the battle had begun, and fired his flare to signal all frontline Eastern armies to attack the West. The full engagement of the battle began sometime between 8am and 10am.</p><p>The Eastern Army moved in to engage the Western Army, and with the frontlines of both armies holding off each other, Tokugawa began advancing his groups from the far east of the battlefield to encourage his troops and also scare his opponents.</p><p>All the while, <b>Kobayakawa</b> <span class='ja'>小早川</span> stood on the top of Mt. Matsuo <span class='ja'>松尾山</span>, his forces never joining the battle. Prior to the battle, he had made an agreement with Tokugawa through Kuroda. He would betray Ishida and join the fight as a member of the Eastern Army. But, he had yet to make any move. Ishida fired a flare signalling him to attack, but still he stood there with indecision. </p><p>Apparently, it wasn't until Tokugawa's troops fired some warning shots at him that <b>Kobayakawa</b> ordered his troops down the hill and attack <b>Otani</b> <span class='ja'>大谷</span>, the nearest of the Western Army. Otani was prepared for Kobayakawa's betrayal, but didn't expect several others to join him. His forces could not withstand their rush attack. Otani committed seppuku in the woods and ordered his retainer to hide his head to prevent it from getting into enemy hands. </p><p>All of the yellow armies were now members of the Eastern Army. Behind the Eastern Army, in the back, marked in green, were forces led by the <b>Mori</b> <span class='ja'>毛利</span> clan. They pledged to fight for the Western Army, but were prevented from joining when one of their armies refused to fight. And after seeing Kobayakawa turn, they knew that winning was hopeless.</p><p>With <b>Otani's</b> forces eradicted, <b>Kobayakawa's</b> betrayal, and <b>Mori's</b> neutrality, the Western Army had collapsed. The was no way for <b>Ishida</b> to win. His friend Otani was dead. His other friend, Shima, was missing and presumed killed in battle. Four other battle commanders were also killed. He ordered a retreat. He, Ukita, and a few others escaped from the battle.</p><p><b>Shimadzu</b> Yoshihiro <span class='ja'>島津義弘</span> and nephew <b>Shimadzu</b> Toyohisa <span class='ja'>島津豊久</span>, leaders of their forces in the Western Army refused to turn their backs to the enemy to retreat. While the battle had mostly concluded by 2pm, they launched a surprise offensive to the middle of the frontline, piercing through the Eastern Army. And making their retreat to the south. The nephew was killed in this surprise attack/retreat, but Yoshihiro could escape.</p><p>The Battle was over. The full length of the battle only took around 6 hours, although the main clash of armies only took place from Kuroda's signal flare to not long after Otani committed seppuku. Of the Western Army's 82,000 soldiers, 23,000 had defected and 35,270 were killed. The Eastern Army only lost 8,000 soldiers.</p><div class='title'><b>After the Battle</b></div><p>As the fighting ceased, the remaining Western soldiers were either captured or executed. Tokugawa put down a folding stool in the field near his final encampment and performed the post-battle ritual called the Head Viewing Ceremony, or kubi-jikken <span class='ja'>首実検</span>.</p><p>This spot and so many other key locations of the battle have been preserved in modern day Sekigahara.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3079_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Here is the location where Tokugawa sat as he inspected the heads. Next to this is a plaque which describes the scene:</p><p><i>Tokugawa Ieyasu, fresh from his decisive victory at the Battle of Sekigahara, sat here on a folding stool called a shogi to inspect the heads of the enemy commanders his allies presented. The heads, once inspected, were buried in two great mounds along with the corpses from the battlefield. During the Warring States Period, it was customary to mourn the dead of both sides, enemy and ally alike, so this inspection was also a gesture of respect for the dead.</i></p><p>Wikipedia continues by explaining that the Head Viewing Ceremony was a way of mourning and respecting the dead of both sides, but it was also a way for victorious commanders and soldiers to get recognized for their valor in the battle, and get properly rewarded for it. This scene is illustrated at <a href="/old/v7/sekigahara-warland$0023head-viewing" title="/sekigahara-warland#head-viewing">Sekigahara Warland.</a></p><p>After the heads were inspected, they were wrapped in cloth and placed in one of two massive burial mounds along with the corpses of the dead.</p><p>Today, the site of the Head Viewing Ceremony and Tokugawa's final encampment is the location of the new Battle of Sekigahara museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Battle of Sekigahara Museum</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Battle of Sekigahara Museum opened recently in 2020, and while I consider the museum a must visit if you're going to Sekigahara, it is a very uneven experience. I arrived just as the museum opened at 9:30am. Tickets are only 500<span class='ja'>円</span> which includes a theater experience, if reservations are not full. I was first on the standby list for the film starting at 9:45am. There were only a few reservations ahead of me.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Theater</b></div><p>Entering the theater, you walk down a hallway with projected names of the wall of all those involved in the battle. The first theater is a trapezoidal room with a projected map on the floor. The map begins showing dates and events leading up to the battle. It shows a full map of Japan where Ishida and Tokugawa allies were located, and zooms in on the center of Japan as their forces begin to converge in Sekigahara.</p><p>As everyone entered the room and surrounded the map, the film was introduced by the guide and then it began. It quickly went through the leading dates and events again, and then showed Sekigahara. Each army, their commander, and their position on the map was introduced, and then the battle began as I had described it above. </p><p>As each key moments of the battle played out, the armies moved on the map and clashed with their opponents. It was kind of like a strategy game, which became an incredibly effective way of showing how the battle progressed. The soldiers themselves were tiny little colored men, but the commanders of those armies were blown up giants when their key moments took place. They spoke their intentions with emotion and feeling which illustrated some intensity of the battle.</p><p>As the battle concluded, everyone moved into the next, octogonal theater. This one had theater seating. I sat in the back and the film began showing the same battle, but this time, from the point of view of the ground rather than a birdseye view. The film was projected onto half of the room, giving us a 180 view of the battle. Fans mounted on the ceiling blew air at us and we sweeped around the battle. Lights flashed as gun fire erupted. And the ground shook and rumbled our seats as horses ran past. Once again, each of the key moments of battle were highlighted showing us the emotion of the commanders and their decisions which led to either victory or defeat.</p><p>It was a pretty hyped experience and incredibly effective at teaching us about the battle and those involved. Prior to the museum, I really only knew about Ishida and Tokugawa, and also knew about Otani committing seppuku. Now I knew about the majority of key commanders in the battle and what they did. I don't think I have ever visited a museum and came out learning as much as I had from this.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Exhibit</b></div><p>The theater experience is in STARK contrast to the rest of the museum. After exiting the theater, we rode the escalator to the second floor. The second floor exhibit shows the number of soldiers in each of the army, and then displays replica armor of each of the commanders. Shiny new looking armor, obviously not realistic to what they actually wore at the time.</p><p>From there, several letters were displayed of correspondence between commanders leading up to the battle. I had no idea what any of these were at the time. They might be more interesting now that I've researched the battle in more detail for these blog posts.</p><p>Overall, the main exhibit of the museum was just a bunch of stuff that wasn't presented with a strong connection to the subject. It was completely different compared with the film on the first floor. At the end of the exhibit, there were some swords and guns that you could pick up to feel their weight, but it felt kinda tacked on.</p><div class='title'><b>Museum Observatory</b></div><p>The fifth floor gave a 360-degree view of Sekigahara. The museum was in the very center of town and the center of the battle, so you could see everything from this point.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3101_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>Looking east is Mt. Nangu <span class='ja'>南宮山</span>, the tallest mountain on the right, and in front of that is Mt. Momobukari <span class='ja'>桃配山</span>. Mt. Nangu was where <b>Mori</b> Hidemoto <span class='ja'>毛利秀元</span> stationed his encampment and Mt. Momobukari was where <b>Kikkawa</b> Hiroie <span class='ja'>吉川広家</span> stationed his. </p><p>Not fully detailed above, but Kikkawa fought for the Western Army and was a member of the Mori clan. He secretly made a deal with Kuroda and Tokugawa that if he prevented the Mori clan from attacking, the Mori clan would retain all their lands after battle. Kikkawa kept his word and prevented the Mori clan from attacking, but the Mori had no knowledge of this neutrality. After the battle, Kikkawa was labeled a traitor to the clan, and the Mori was still punished for supporting Ishida.</p><p>At the base of Mt. Momobukari was where Tokugawa stationed his 30,000 men at the beginning of battle. Again, as the battle progressed, his army moved forward to the current position of this photo.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3095_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking just a little bit more north to the northeast, you can see Okayama signalling hill. This is where <b>Kuroda</b> Nagamasa <span class='ja'>黒田長政</span> and <b>Takenaka</b> Shigekado <span class='ja'>竹中重門</span> stationed their troops, and were they lit their flare signifying the begin of the battle for the Eastern Army.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3117_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Looking to the north and the west gives a nice view of Sekigahara. In the distance on the right, underneath the taller mountains is the short Mt. Sasao <span class='ja'>笹尾山</span>, where <b>Ishida</b> Mitsunari <span class='ja'>石田三成</span> set his encampment. At the foot of this mountain is where the Sekigahara Tourism Center and <a href="/old/v7/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama" title="/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama">Exchange Center</a> can be found. Also, in the fields out front is the monument to the Battle and where some of the battle reenactments take place.</p><p>In the forests to the west is where <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span> stationed his troops, and between Otani and Ishida's camps is where <b>Ukita</b> Hideie <span class='ja'>宇喜多秀家</span> stationed his troops. The whole of what would become the Western army is lined up in the above photo.</p><p>In front of us, next to the cemetary and monuments is where <b>Tokugawa</b> Ieyasu <span class='ja'>徳川家康</span> set his final encampment and where he held the Head Viewing Ceremony to conclude the battle. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3123_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There's not a whole lot to see to the south. The Sekigahara Manufacturing Warehouse obscures almost all of the view. But, in the background is Mt. Matsuo <span class='ja'>松尾山</span>, where <b>Kobayakawa</b> Hideaki <span class='ja'>小早川秀秋</span> stationed his troops, and eventually turned on the Western Army assuring victory for the East. Near the right edge of the photo are the forests where <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span> was stationed.</p><p>This observation point is an amazing touch to the museum as it shows the real locations of the battle from the film earlier and also shows the scale of the entire field.</p><p>Although, nothing really shows the full scale of the field than visiting each of the specific locations.</p><div class='title'><b>Tokugawa Ieyasu's First Encampment</b></div><p>When I traveled to Sekigahara, I left my apartment around 6:30 in the morning. I flew down the highway and arrived in Sekigahara around 8:30am. The first place I visited was Tokugawa's first encampment, on the east end of town, at the base of Mt.

You can barely see the Museum from here. Okayama, where Kuroda and Takenaka were stationed, obscures the view of Mt. Sasao, where Ishida was.

They were followed closely by Ieyasu and around 30,000 troops before arriving at dawn on the 21st. Ieyasu stationed his troops here at Mt. Momokubari at around 6am. Irritated by early Western forces success, he is said to have drawn his sword on a retainer who had failed to dismount in his presence.</i></p><p><i>In order to psychologically upset the enemy, and encourge his own troops, Ieyasu moved his command post to a more central position at around 11am.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Okayama Signaling Hill</b></div><p>After visiting the Battle of Sekigahara Museum and the <a href="/old/v7/sengoku-armor-museum" title="/sengoku-armor-museum">Sengoku Armor Museum</a>, I was ahead of my planned schedule.

At this time, Kazumasa hung the statue of the Omononushi <span class='ja'>大物主神</span>, the diety of Kotohira Shrine (from his hometown of Kotohira Town in Kagawa Prefecture, called Sanuki province at the time), which he had been carrying on a pine branch and prayed for victory in the battle.</i></p><p><i>After the Battle, the villages are said to have received this statue and worshipped it.

After that, the entire village of Sekigahara revered the god of business and the Kotohira-Ko <span class='ja'>金刀比羅講</span> was organized. Every year on October 10th, a representative was sent to the main shrine in Sanuki (Kagawa pref.) to present a sacred talisman. (This is no longer done.)

Sasao gave Ishida a full view of Sekigahara. Ishida could see all of his armies on the west and also see all the armies of the east coming at him. Okayama's plateau was probably visible at the time, but if not, you could still clearly see any army coming from that location, with the exception of Kuroda's flank attack which went further north, using the forest as cover.</p><p>The nearby plaque had the following to say:</p><p><i>Mt. Sasao was the perfect defensive position, providing high ground and a panoramic view.

It is thought that Mitsunari and Shimadzu Yoshihiro's troops were then overwhelmed by the advancing Eastern Army. With Mitsunari's units soon overrun, the Shimadzu clan retreated from the front lines.

You can clearly see Ishida and Kuroda's positions at Mt. Sasao and Okayama.</p><p>The above plaque and other research says that Kobayakawa finally made his decision to betray Ishida when Tokugawa fired shots at Mt. Matsuo to force him into a decision. But, other scholars have pointed out that with the chaos of battle and general distance, there would really be no way for him to tell the difference between shots fired at him or anyone else in battle.</p><p>The plaque at the top of the mountain had some other insights:</p><p><i>Mt. Matsuo, located here on the border between Mino (Gifu prefecture) and Omi (Shiga prefecture) overlooking vital roadways from its 293m summit, has long been recognized as a strategic viewpoint. Prior to the Battle of Sekigahara, Western commander Ishida Mitsunari ordered maintenance work be done to the mountaintop castle as part of the preparations against the Eastern forces. The existing remains of the castle are from the time of these repairs. One day before the battle, Kobayakawa Hideaki led his 15,000 troops here to Mt. Matsuo and entered the castle.</i></p><p><i>For much of the battle, Kobayakawa remained a spectator to the action taking place below, failing to fight for one side or the other until around midday, when he betrayed the Western side. Attacking Otani Yoshitsugu's forces, Kobayakawa brought about the downfall of the Western ranks, and provided victory to the Eastern Army.</i></p><p><i>A large area near the top of the mountain has been flattened, and is surrounded by a low earthen wall. The remains of a masugata gate system to prevent enemy intrusion can also be found. The ruins cover an area of around 400m east to west and 250m north to south, indicating that Matsuo Castle was one of the largest mountain castles in the Mino (Gifu) area.</i></p><p>There used to be so many smaller castles in Japan, especially battle castles perched on mountains at strategic points. Nearly all of those castles are gone now, having been destroyed by whomever took them over.</p><p>Also at the summit were 6 frogs hanging out in a muddy bit of water makin' babies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sekigahara/IMG_3851_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Anyways, no matter whether Kobayakawa saw the warning shots or ultimately made the decision on his own after viewing the battle, his troops rode straight down the mountain and into the forest directly north to face the troops of <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span>.</p><div class='title'><b>Otani's Gravesite and Encampment</b></div><p>While Kobayakawa's encampment was the final place I visited in Sekigahara on that day, I went to Otani's encampment in the morning before going to the museum.

Being outnumbered and having lost his battle, he sacrificed himself by his own hand in the true Bushido spirit.</i></p><p>In the Battle of Sekigahara, people ultimately respect Otani and his sacrafice the most.</p><p>On the other hand, people seem to hate Kobayakawa, despite his actions causing Tokugawa to win and create peace and prosperity for 250 years.

The person behind me in line got Kobayakawa on her ticket, and her date was teasing her the whole time. <span class='ja'>いやだ〜</span>, she kept saying.</p><div class='title'><b>Remembrance</b></div><p>The biggest reason people love this battle and its legacy continues to this day with TV shows, movies, manga, and other media is that the decisive victory completely changing the history of Japan. After the battle and after Tokugawa successfully rooted out the rest of the Toyotomi loyalists, he had complete control over the country, and his dictatorship led to great prosperity.</p><p>But, the other big reason for everyone's interest in the battle is also its divisiveness. Tokugawa was an asshole who completely undermined Toyotomi's rule immediately after his death. It was an insult to Toyotomi and Ishida was very outspoken about this. Others who also hated Tokugawa's attitude continued to stoke Ishida into action, and the schemes and political bullshit continued from there. While Ishida was also a bit of an asshole, he represented loyalty and honor. Many of his friends and commanders in the Western Army were the same.</p><p>The battle was ultimately a fight between those loyal to the current ideals of Japan and the strength of someone wanting all the power for himself. It's far different than people remembering something like the American Civil War, which was fought over slavery, something clearly right or wrong.</p><p>The TV show, Shogun, portrays Tokugawa as an underdog with Ishida trying to keep all the power for himself, but in reality it seems completely different. Of course, Shogun isn't trying to be completely historically accurate, but it still becomes pro-Tokugawa propaganda. The show really contextualized Japan's xenophobia at the time as the Europeans seemed intent on conquering Japan for themselves.</p><p>There is also a 2017 Japanese film based on a 1966 Japanese novel about the Battle of Sekigahara. It won a couple of awards, too, so I would like to see how they portray all the characters. Will they portray them in a neutral manor so the audience must decide which side was right? Or will they portray Tokugawa as a traitor to the current ideals of Japan or Ishida as a foolish conservative?</p><p>After visiting the sites and museums, I am more on the side of Ishida in this fight, even though it is clear that his loss was a necessity for Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Revisit</b></div><p>I am way more informed about the Battle than I was before having visited these locations, gone through all the photos, and looked up all the information online.</p><p>Now, there are several more locations I want to visit, like Mori's encampment on Mt. Nangu, Shimadzu's and Ukita's encampment in the middle of the Western Army, Fukushima's encampment at the head of the Eastern army, some of the other local folklore museums in Sekigahara, and the Sekigahara visitor center at the station. I would also like to visit the Battle museum and Samurai Armor museum again with my now better base of knowledge.</p><p>There are so many minor lords who participated in the battle, too, who each have their story. Kanamori Nagachika <span class='ja'>金森長近</span>, founder of modern day Takayama, also participated in the battle with around 1,000 troops. I wonder if they placed a marker at his position.</p><p>I definitely want to check out the Battle Reenactment festival, too, so maybe I'll visit all these locations in October, if there's time. We'll see.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Sekigahara Warland 関ケ原ウォーランド" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/sekigahara-warland">Sekigahara Warland 関ケ原ウォーランド</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

It first opened in 1964 and displays over 200 lifesize concrete soldiers recreating the atmosphere and intensity of the battle. Many of the major lords are present from the battle as well as several minor lords. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The park feels like a forgotten relic due to its age and general lack of upkeep or any form of modernization. The concrete figures are a huge mixed bag of quality, from the general inhuman facial details, varying degrees of skin tones (from dark brown to yellow to white to pink), and warped joints (possibly from a lack of precise molding equipment). In addition, many of the key figures of the battle whose appearance is pretty consistent across the other museums in town are very generic here.</p><p>Also, there are 60 year old coin machines at the entrance which no longer operate. There's a lecture hall whose doors barely opened. Inside the lecture hall, there's a diorama of the battle which doesn't seem like it works anymore. And the admissions desk was staffed by an apathetic old woman who seemed bothered and took her time selling me a ticket, and said nothing the whole time.</p><p>It really feels like a burnt out 80s theme park from the movies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Many of the concrete figures have nameplates underneath them identifying who the statue is meant to represent. Unfortunately, the education ends there. Warland doesn't offer any documentation on any of the figures in their park beyond a few posted signs. It's nice there is some identification but if you don't know who these people are, there's no immediate way of finding out.</p><p>Local people probably have a good idea. Also, maybe they offered some kind of tour guide for the park? There was certainly no guide when I visited on this Saturday afternoon.</p><div class='title'><b>Mori Clan <span class='ja'>毛利氏</span></b></div><p>After entering Warland, there were several named statues on the hillside to the right.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Ankokuji</b> Ekei <span class='ja'>安国寺恵瓊</span> was a military monk who was close with <b>Kobayakawa</b> Takakage, leader of the Kobayakawa clan and who would've been a member of the Five Regeants had he not died before Toyotomi in 1598. The Kobayakawa clan was a sub-faction of the Mori clan, and with Takakage's death, Ankokuji feared the Mori clan would be wiped out with the loss of a great leader. He was happy that <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span>succeeded in becoming a regeant giving them the strength to protect their survival, but this forced the Kobayakawa clan against Tokugawa as Mori supported Ishida.</p><p><b>Ankokuji</b> Ekei became one of the top commanders of the Mori army and commanded his own army of 1800 troops stationed further east from the battle, planning on attacking Tokugawa's rear.

It is said that through his diplomacy and politics he was able to keep the peace between the sub-factions of the Mori clan after <b>Kobayakawa</b> Takakage's death. On the day of the Battle, as mentioned above, his army of 4200 was stationed in front of Ankokuji and the whole of the Mori army.</p><p>Mori's retainers supported Ishida and the other Toyotomi loyalists, but it was clear to Kikkawa that they would lose the battle. Kikkawa made a secret pact with <b>Kuroda</b> Nagamasa <span class='ja'>黒田長政</span> of the Tokugawa army that if he prevented the Mori armies from joining the battle, the Mori clan would be spared and be able to keep their domains. So, when the Mori clan gave Kikkawa the order to attack, he refused. And his refusal prevented the rest of the Mori clan from engaging in the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is Mori, by the way, but not <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span>, who was one of the Five Regeants.

Hidemoto was determined to support Ishida of the Western Army and brought 15,000 soldiers of his army to the battle. But, because of Kikkawa's inaction, he was prevented from attacking.</p><p>After the battle, the whole secret pact fell apart because Mori never agreed to it. It was only Kikkawa who put forth the idea to Kuroda and Tokugawa. As such, the Mori clan lost 75% of its territories after Tokugawa became Shogun, and they labeled Kikkawa as a traitor.

It's not perfect, but the kanji <span class='ja'>氏家久左衛門</span> is pretty close.</p><p>Ujiie planned on joining the Eastern Army with Tokugawa, but with his kingdom in the path of the Western Army, he returned to his home and his family joined with Ishida. According to Wikipedia, he never joined the battle, so this is further confirmation it's not the right person.</p><p>After the battle, the Ujiie clan was dissolved, and Yukihiro became a ronin. In the shadows, he still supported the efforts of those still fighting against Tokugawa.

Katou was one of the seven generals who plotted to assassinate Ishida after the death of Toyotomi. Kuroda was in this group, too. With the loss of the Korean war, Ishida wrote terrible performance reviews about them, calling them imcompetant for the loss. Tokugawa used this opportunity to shield Ishida from their wraith, but then gained their loyalty when it was clear he would war against Ishida.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3648_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Lots of fighting going on.</p><p>In the front is <b>Fukushima</b> Masanori <span class='ja'>福島正則</span>, another one of the seven general alongside Katou and Kuroda. In the Battle, he was given the right to led the Eastern Army against Ishida's Western Army. However, Ii Naomasa <span class='ja'>井伊直政</span> and Matsudaira Tadayoshi <span class='ja'>松平忠吉</span> had their gunman fire on the Eastern Army prior to the start of the battle, which enraged Fukushima to start the battle immediatley.</p><p>Futher in the back is <b>Miyamoto</b> Musashi <span class='ja'>宮本武蔵</span>, a legendary Japanese swordsman who eventually wrote The Book of Five Rings <span class='ja'>五輪の書</span> detailing the essence of true swordsmanship in both technique, attitude, and personal philosophy.

Scholars believed the he had participated in the Battle of Sekigahara and the creators of Warland thought so, too.</p><p>Warland depicts Musashi and his father as fighting for the Western Army, which was the prevailing idea at the time as he was a longtime vassal of the Ukita clan. However, according to Wikipedia, after studying Kuroda's personal records of the battle, scholars have Musashi's father as serving Tokugawa's army instead. Scholars claim that having Musashi fighting for the West was always a romanticized ideal of him being an amazing ronin warrior fighting for the heart of Japan, but facts do not point to this.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Kani</b> Saizo <span class='ja'>可児才蔵</span> was a commander in Fukushima's army.

He brought 15,000 troops to the battle and was stationed on Matsuo-yama overlooking the whole battlefield from the south. As mentioned above, his father, Kobayakawa Takakage, was a high ranking member with the Toyotomi government and the Mori clan. He would've been a member of the Five Regeants, had he not passed away a year before Toyotomi's death.</p><p>With Takakage's death, Hideaki became in charge of the Kobayakawa clan. As Ishida began raising his army against Tokugawa, Tokugawa grew seeds of betrayal with Hideaki. He claimed that Ishida was responsible for the embarassment he suffered for a defeat a few years prior. On the day of the Battle, Hideaki was still indecisive whether or not to go through with his betrayal. It is said that fake gunfire from Tokugawa finally pushed him into riding down the hill and attacking the Western Army.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3667_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Hiratsuka</b> Tamehiro <span class='ja'>平塚為広</span> fought for the Western Army against Tokugawa.

In comparison, Warland is a primitive way of showing almost the same thing.</p><p>However, it's still an incredible place. The Battle Museum does show the intensity of the battle, but when you're in the field of around 200 lifesize concrete soldiers, you can feel the scale and chaos of the battle.

Often museums and other exhibits will use replicas or recreations of the original armor. The owner of this collection only collects and restores original pieces from the Battle of Sekigahara and the Sengoku period in general. Several of the pieces were owned by major lords in the battle, but not necessrily worn in the battle itself. Many of the other pieces were worn by soldiers in the battle, some of which were killed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The museum is just north of the main Battle of Sekigahara museum, and currently only takes reservations to view the collection. I emailed the owner the day before visiting, and he replied later in the evening saying I was all set to visit.</p><p>Viewing the collection is 800<span class='ja'>円</span>, but you could pay more for detailed lectures about each of his pieces and also try on some armor, if you're small enough. There's also an attached shop with some exclusive Sekigahara merch, and a small restaurant where the family will cook an "authentic" samurai meal for you. They also have a pet duck. :)</p><p>I was only interested in the armor for this visit, but next time I think I'll go for the lectural experience.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Immediately to the right after reception were 9 sets of armor, mostly consisting of foot soldiers. I'm not sure if any of these were used in the Battle of Sekigahara. In fact, the emblem above the middle set of armor is of the Fujiwara clan, which never participated in the battle.</p><p>The Fujiwara clan rose to power in the 800s, but another 800 years later at the time of the Battle, I think the clan had mostly been divided and renamed into other factions and eventually bred out of existance. One of their military branches was renamed the Monnashi clan, which did participate in the battle within Tokugawa's Eastern Army.</p><p>The flags in the back have the Ishida emblem on them, and the front foot soldier helmets have <span class='ja'>石</span> ishi written on them, so maybe those are some of Ishida's men? Although, they fought for the Western Army. Somewhat confusing.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3162_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3173_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Displayed on tables on the sides of the entrance were assorted pieces of armor used in the battle.

He said it was alright if I took some photos, but his workshop with armor currently being restored was off limits.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3177_t.webp" /></a></p><p>One of the first sections was devoted to <b>Ukita</b> Hideie <span class='ja'>宇喜多秀家</span> and his army. The main armor in the back was samurai armor owned by the Ukita clan at the time of the Battle. It's most likely not the armor he wore in the Battle, but it was armor he owned at that time. In the front are two sets of army from soldiers in his army. They are distinctly recognizable because of the Ukita clan emblems.</p><p>Ukita was one of the members of the Council of Five Regeants after Toyotomi passed away. He was very close to Toyotomi, so it was natural that he sided with Ishida against Tokugawa. One year after Toyotomi's death, there was an internal rebellion in the Ukita clan which resulted in several key members leaving to join Tokugawa. His army was slightly diminished but was still the largest army within the overall Western Army.</p><p>He survived the Battle of Sekigahara, although most of his army did not. He went into hiding, but was eventually captured and exiled to Hachijo-jima, a tiny volcanic island in the middle of the Pacific.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3182_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Next is armor previously owned by the Otani clan. <b>Otani</b> Yoshitsugu <span class='ja'>大谷吉継</span> was a close friend of Ishida. He was also fiercely loyal and honorable. Despite being inflicted with harsh illness which blinded him, he still brought his army to Sekigahara to fight with Ishida against Tokugawa.</p><p>Unfortunately, his army was completely overrun when Kobayakawa defected to the Eastern Army in the middle of  battle and attacked his army. They were completely overwhelmed, and thus, Otani committed seppuku to avoid capture and also to show his loyalty to the Western Army. His retainers took and hid his head and armor, so the Eastern Army could not have the satisfcation of his defeat.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3186_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The above armor belonged to the Maeda family. <b>Maeda</b> Toshiie <span class='ja'>前田利家</span> was appointed as one of the Five Regeants after Toyotomi's death. Unfortunately, Maeda was also not in the best of health and died a year later. His son, Maeda Toshinaga <span class='ja'>前田利長</span> succeded him, but fell into a political trap set by Tokugawa. As such, Maeda could not stand against Tokugawa and he fought for the Eastern Army.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3188_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Next is armor from the Mori clan. <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span> was also one of the Five Regeants and pledged his support with Ishida in the Western Army. Mori's army was stationed in the east of the battlefield, and meant to swoop in behind Tokugawa's army and pincer them. However, when he was signaled to attack, he did nothing. After seeing the tide of battle shift heavily against the Western Army, he refused to attack and stayed neutral, sparing his men.</p><p>He political standing was diminished after the battle by 75%, but faithfully assisted the Tokugawa Shogunate years after the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3189_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Next, we have armor of the Shimidzu clan. <b>Shimadzu</b> Yoshihiro <span class='ja'>島津義弘</span> and nephew <b>Shimadzu</b> Toyohisa <span class='ja'>島津豊久</span> were leaders who supported the Western Army. Their numbers were few, but had a fierce honorable spirit. After the battle had been lost, they refused to turn their backs to the enemy. In order to retreat, they ran a final assault on the front lines of the Eastern Army, breaking through, and continuing to escape to the south. Nephew Toyohisa did not survive the escape.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3190_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3204_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>There were more pieces of armor at the end of the room, but I have trouble identifying which armies they belong to. Some of the armor is pretty distinct, but there really isn't an easy guide to follow for identifying them. I should've taken notes or asked the owner about them, but I hadn't researched anything before visiting.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3217_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These last sets of armor were back near the entrance of the room. I think he mentioned that all of these armor belonged to members of the Tokugawa clan, which makes sense given the above emblem. <b>Tokugawa</b> Ieyasu <span class='ja'>徳川家康</span> was one of the members of the Five Regeants and the key agitator which led to the Battle of Sekigahara.</p><p>While TV shows and history sometimes paint him as a glorious unifier of Japan, he is incredibly cold, manipulative, and constantly schemes against his rivals. Immediately after Toyotomi's death, he began scheming a series of marriage pacts to increase his standing, something which was strictly forbidden by Toyotomi. He used other political schemes to blackmail other lords into fighting for him. Any opportunity to increase his standing or decrease the standing of another was immediately taken.</p><p>While it seemed like many people hated the outspoken, garish attitude of Ishida, they hated Tokugawa more. Ishida went to war with Tokugawa to preserve the ideals set forth by Toyotomi. Everyone loyal to the deceased unifier of Japan held their ground, but were ultimately overpowered by Tokugawa's influence and strength.</p><p>After the battle, everyone loyal to Toyotomi was either executed, exiled, or significantly diminished. With full control of the government, Tokugawa banned weapons, shut down the country, and put to death anyone who would continue to oppose him.</p><p>On one hand, he was a harsh dictator that people secretly hated and feared. On the other hand, his rule set Japan on a course of extreme prosperity the country had never seen before. The population exploded, literacy exploded, and culture exploded. Japan became a modern beacon of the world, which became quite popular in Europe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having better knowledge of the battle and those involved, next time I go back to the museum, I'll have a better idea of what to ask about the armor and be in a better place to take notes.</p><p>The museum itself is really small. Again, calling it a collection is a better term, but it's still a worthwhile visit. The owner speaks English pretty well, so it's easy to have a conversation and talk about the armor and the battle in detail.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Samurai Armor at Sasaoyama Center" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/samurai-armor-at-sasaoyama">Samurai Armor at Sasaoyama Center</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

The bull horns are the most distinct feature of his armor.</p><p>He was one of the most seasoned battle commanders in the Eastern Army and led the front line against the Western Army. He was given personal permission to have the first strike against the Western Army, but Ii Naomasa and Matsudaira Tadayoshi took that away from him when their gunman fired.

Big 'ol square head.</p><p>Kuroda was Tokugawa's chief military strategist and perhaps the most cunning strategist in all of Japan. His army was stationed on Okayama, north east of the main battlefield and covered Ishida's flank, forcing him into the center of the fight. He also conspired with Kobayakawa to turn him against Ishida, ultimately allowing Tokugawa to win the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3380_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The next costume armor is of <b>Kobayakawa</b> Hideaki <span class='ja'>小早川秀秋</span>. The red robe and trident ornament on the helmet are the most distinguishing features.</p><p>Kobayakawa was only 19 year old at the time of the battle. His army was the second most numerous in the Western Army, consisting of 15,000 troops. His troops stayed at Matsuoyama and did not engage in the battle until he finally made the decision to betray Ishida and attack Otani of the Western Army. As mentioned above, Otani committed seppuku as a result, and the rest of the Western Army quickly fell.</p><p>Because of his role in the battle, Tokugawa increased Kobayakawa's standing by giving him all castles and lands previously owned by Ukita, which included Okayama castle and vast territories in Bizen. Although, at 21 years old, he drank himself to death. He had no heir, so Kobayakawa was officially dissolved.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3384_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Lastly, we have a costume simliar to the armor of <b>Shimadzu</b> Yoshihiro <span class='ja'>島津義弘</span>. The leaping fox ornament of the helmet is its most distinguishing feature.</p><p>He and his nephew were members of the Western Army. After the battle had been lost, they refused to retreat by showing their backs to the enemy. So with the little manpower they had left, they charged through the center of the battlefield completely surprising Tokugawa and the eastern armies. They broke through the line and continued charging south to make their retreat. His nephew was killed in the assault, but Yoshihiro made it through.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3360_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Besides the fancy replica armor, they had a few sets of armor that had been weathered to look more realistic. The above armor was made after armor belonging to <b>Katou</b> Kiyomasa <span class='ja'>加藤</span> <span class='ja'>清正</span>, distinctive because its one meter high helmet. </p><p>Katou was a member of the Eastern Army, but was not in the Battle of Sekigahara. He was battling and defeating Ishida's allies in Kyushu at the same time.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sasao_armor/IMG_3389_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Along with Katou's armor were a few more pieces. I could not identify the middle armor, but armor on the left is of the Monnashi clan. The Monnashi clan was a military branch of what was left of the Fujiwara clan. The Fujiwara clan came to power around the 800s, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of information about it at the time of the Battle. There was no Monnashi army, and I think this was just a commander in the Tokugawa army.</p><p>There were a few other pieces there too, used by actors in the reenactment.</p><p>Overall, it was a fun surprise to see some of these after visiting the Sekigahara Battle Museum and Sengoku Armor museum. Even though these were costumes, all of the armor in the battle was pretty distinct, so you can usually identify it easily from its main characteristics.<br/></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Small Worlds" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/small-worlds">Small Worlds</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

Subtitled as the Miniature Museum, it has four main massive-scale miniature models, where each single person is about the size of a thumbnail. These four areas are space-themed, fantasy-themed, the Kansai airport, and Tokyo-3. The space and fantasy themed areas are further divided into sub-areas with more focused themes.</p><p>Entry is a little pricey at 3200<span class='ja'>円</span>, but I think the price tag is worth it for a one-time visit. If you enjoy the museum a lot, they have a 3D scanning studio in the middle of the museum. From the 3D scans, they can print and color a 3D model of yourself. The cheapest one is 6600<span class='ja'>円</span> for a small figure of 1 person, but the price can come down with multiple people. Additionally, you could pay to have your figure be part of the museum.</p><p>I visited on a Friday afternoon, so the museum was pretty empty with only a few visitors. A company or group of people booked the cafe for the full day, so I was unable to visit any exhibits on that floor. Also, occasionally waves of people would rush through the museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Space Theme - Space Center</b></div><p>After paying the entrance fee and taking the elevator to 3F, you enter the main exhibits of the museum, starting with the Space Center.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The area begins with the Apollo Space center. Dozens of American cars line the streets to catch a glimpse of the Apollo rocket being taxied to the launch pad and shot into the space. By searching through all of the cars and crowds, you can find several easter eggs, such as the Men in Black and the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8704.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8704.webp">Trimaxion Drone</a> from Flight of the Navigator.</p><p>Throughout the entire museum, several parts of the models are connected to buttons.

It's a mini-scale museum for the space station's inhabitants showing the development of space travel (witnessed back in the Apollo Space center) to the current age. Visitors peer at the recreations of the original <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8755.webp">moon landing</a>, and other triumphs of space travel.</p><p>There is a fourth, smaller exhibit dedicated to Diaclone, a Tony toy-line of giant robots from the 80s. It's a bit under-developed compared to the scale and unity of the overall space area. Its just a collection of the old toys with the theme song playing on the screen behind it.</p><div class='title'><b>Fantasy Theme - Global Village</b></div><p>The fantasy themed Global Village has five areas, each seamlessly connected, like the space themed area. The area begins with Snow Mine Peaks City.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8762.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8762.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8762_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8762_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8762_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The mining village is covered in railways cutting through the mountain into emerald mines. Further up the mountain are snow covered trails with skiers. When hitting buttons, the train cars emerge from the tunnels and come into town. </p><p>Moving away from the mountains into flatter areas is the Dragon Village, a bustling town with many stores, restaurants, and entertainment. Further east, is the Dragon forest, where the dragons and their riders live.</p><p>Dropping down from the high cliffs of dragons and the highlands is Wall Sanctuary Resort on the sea.

You'd think it might be difficult to find such specific things in such a vast detailed world, but the whirring of the gears opening the treasure boxes gave them away. That being said, I could only find 4. I could hear a fifth one near the end. Although, it was always whirring, so maybe it was the broken O. Anyways, I won't give away the answer, but it's pretty obvious.</p><p>With the answer to the puzzle, you go back to the Space Center, whisper the word to the attendant at the concierge and get your prize, a piece of candy. I would have rather gotten a sticker or something non-perishable.

Above the city, the railways are elevated and move people to and from the large angular buildings. One of my favorite buildings was the library, where several floors of books are exposed to staircases surrounding the outside of the building.</p><p>Finally, past the capitol, is Zhenshimen City, where nightlife is king. Neon signs line the roads and alleyways of the vibrant town enticing any person or robot to come inside and stay for a while.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8854.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8854.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8854_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8854_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8854_t.webp"></a></p><p>This was by far the most dynamic, detailed, and dense area of the Global Village. Every angle and vantage point looking into the buildings offered something new to be seen and discovered. Those remaining letters had to be in here somewhere, but I could never find them. Some of the buttons and interactions were broken in this area, too.</p><div class='title'><b>Creators Gallery</b></div><p>Before moving onto the third main area, there was an exhibition room for miniature diorama artists to display and sell their works.

Some were for display only, not for sale. The ones for sale had a price tag of around $10,000, I think? Given the time, detail, and expertise put into the model, that seems...  I dunno. Maybe accurate.</p><p>Another artist has some beautiful snowy scenes.

The Tokyo Metro Building in west Shinjuku is one such building known for its twin towers. It was often depicted in classic anime series (particularly CLAMP series) as a source of power. In reality, it's a governmental building which administrates all the city affairs of Shinjuku and surrounding neighborhoods.</p><p>Besides that, the building serves another purpose which attracts quite a few tourists. Its observation deck is one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the whole city. And for free! I've been here several times before, and wrote about it too <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-metropolitan-building" title="/tokyo-metropolitan-building">over 10 years ago</a>.</p><p>I was in Tokyo for school business, and as school business concluded, it was near sunset and I was near the Metro Building.

In fact, this is the premiere location of Japan's full-sized Gundams, of which there are 3 now.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Since 2017, the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam occupies this spot. This Gundam is from the anime series and novel, Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. As I understand it, Gundam Unicorn was a soft reboot or retelling of the original Gundam story. Or maybe a modern side story set during the time of the original. Made in 2010, it was a breath of fresh air and a return to roots for the franchise after countless spinoffs, sequels, and over-saturation.</p><p>The most iconic of gundams is the original RX-78 model, which occupied this space from 2009 to 2016. It was built to celebrate the Gundam franchise's 30th anniversary. People say that it was replaced with the Unicorn Gundam as a symbol of Japan moving into the future, with their bid for the 2020 Olympics.</p><p>The original RX-78 Gundam is still sometimes used for events. It was recently used in front of the Gundam Factory in Yokohama, which closed last year. Now, it might be in Osaka according to Wikipedia. Another full-sized Gundam is in Fukuoka, which was completed in 2020.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After arriving in Tokyo for a business trip, I went to Odaiba to see the Gundam during sunset. The timing ended out working perfectly. :)</p><p>4 times a day, the Gundam performs its transformation sequence. I was able to catch the 5pm one, the last of the day. At night, there was a musical performance, but I wanted to get to my hotel and prepare for the next day.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9252_stitch_t.webp" /></a><br/></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (28)
