Subtitled as the Miniature Museum, it has four main massive-scale miniature models, where each single person is about the size of a thumbnail. These four areas are space-themed, fantasy-themed, the Kansai airport, and Tokyo-3. The space and fantasy themed areas are further divided into sub-areas with more focused themes.</p><p>Entry is a little pricey at 3200<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>, but I think the price tag is worth it for a one-time visit. If you enjoy the museum a lot, they have a 3D scanning studio in the middle of the museum. From the 3D scans, they can print and color a 3D model of yourself. The cheapest one is 6600<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> for a small figure of 1 person, but the price can come down with multiple people. Additionally, you could pay to have your figure be part of the museum.</p><p>I visited on a Friday afternoon, so the museum was pretty empty with only a few visitors. A company or group of people booked the cafe for the full day, so I was unable to visit any exhibits on that floor. Also, occasionally waves of people would rush through the museum.</p><div class='title'><b>Space Theme - Space Center</b></div><p>After paying the entrance fee and taking the elevator to 3F, you enter the main exhibits of the museum, starting with the Space Center.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8757_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The area begins with the Apollo Space center. Dozens of American cars line the streets to catch a glimpse of the Apollo rocket being taxied to the launch pad and shot into the space. By searching through all of the cars and crowds, you can find several easter eggs, such as the Men in Black and the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8704.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8704.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8704.webp">Trimaxion Drone</a> from Flight of the Navigator.</p><p>Throughout the entire museum, several parts of the models are connected to buttons.

Find all the Treasure boxes in the Global Village and spell the following word: _ _ _ _ o _. The O was pasted in, so that was probably broken. I could find 4 treasure boxes: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8796.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8796.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8796.webp">here</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8795.webp">here</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8794.webp">here</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8797.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8797.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_smallworlds/IMG_8797.webp">here</a>. You'd think it might be difficult to find such specific things in such a vast detailed world, but the whirring of the gears opening the treasure boxes gave them away. That being said, I could only find 4. I could hear a fifth one near the end. Although, it was always whirring, so maybe it was the broken O. Anyways, I won't give away the answer, but it's pretty obvious.</p><p>With the answer to the puzzle, you go back to the Space Center, whisper the word to the attendant at the concierge and get your prize, a piece of candy.

The Tokyo Metro Building in west Shinjuku is one such building known for its twin towers. It was often depicted in classic anime series (particularly CLAMP series) as a source of power. In reality, it's a governmental building which administrates all the city affairs of Shinjuku and surrounding neighborhoods.</p><p>Besides that, the building serves another purpose which attracts quite a few tourists. Its observation deck is one of the best spots in Tokyo to view the whole city. And for free! I've been here several times before, and wrote about it too <a href="/old/v7/tokyo-metropolitan-building" title="/tokyo-metropolitan-building" title="/tokyo-metropolitan-building">over 10 years ago</a>.</p><p>I was in Tokyo for school business, and as school business concluded, it was near sunset and I was near the Metro Building. I met up with another teacher and some of our students, and we walked to the building to catch the sunset.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_9921_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not only was our timing perfect, but because of the completely clear weather we had all weekend, Mt.

It didn't sustain the interest of my students and the other teacher, though, as they were waiting for me on a couch nearby. They were hungry as their school business of the day was just as long as mine. Also, they were in a bit of hurry since they had tickets for an event at 7pm. We had dinner as fast as we could, then I saw them off in a taxi. </p><p>Contemplating what to do with the rest of my evening, I decided to return to the observation deck and take some night photos.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250209_metro/IMG_0135_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The last time I visited the Metro Building was in summer with some college friends in Japan on vacation.

In fact, this is the premiere location of Japan's full-sized Gundams, of which there are 3 now.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9162_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Since 2017, the RX-0 Unicorn Gundam occupies this spot. This Gundam is from the anime series and novel, Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. As I understand it, Gundam Unicorn was a soft reboot or retelling of the original Gundam story. Or maybe a modern side story set during the time of the original. Made in 2010, it was a breath of fresh air and a return to roots for the franchise after countless spinoffs, sequels, and over-saturation.</p><p>The most iconic of gundams is the original RX-78 model, which occupied this space from 2009 to 2016. It was built to celebrate the Gundam franchise's 30th anniversary. People say that it was replaced with the Unicorn Gundam as a symbol of Japan moving into the future, with their bid for the 2020 Olympics.</p><p>The original RX-78 Gundam is still sometimes used for events. It was recently used in front of the Gundam Factory in Yokohama, which closed last year. Now, it might be in Osaka according to Wikipedia. Another full-sized Gundam is in Fukuoka, which was completed in 2020.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250207_gundam/IMG_9152_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After arriving in Tokyo for a business trip, I went to Odaiba to see the Gundam during sunset.

| November 3, 2024 <!-- by dyreschlock --><span>Comments Off</span></p><div class="entry"><p class='img'><p>Nearly two years ago, Ghibli Park was first opened in the Aichi Commemorative Expo Park, northeast of Nagoya. Ghibli Park is an open-air museum of sorts, with replica houses, buildings, and environments from various works by Ghibli Film. In the center of it all, is the Ghibli Warehouse, which houses a museum, other exhibits, a theater, shops, and several other recreations of Ghibli works and history.</p><p>There are four open-air areas of the Ghibli Park, each require an advanced ticket to enter. Each area is spread around the Expo Park. Here's a map:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp"></a></p><p>In addition to the <span class="orange"><b>Ghibli Warehouse <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ジブリの大倉庫</span></span></b></span> in the middle, the <span class="light_blue"><b>Hill of Youth <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></span></b></span> is near one of the main parking lots and the train station in the north. It's most likely the first area you'll come across. Near the other parking lot and to the south is <span class="olive"><b>Dondoko Forest <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>どんどの森</span></span></b></span>. These were the first areas available when Ghibli Park first opened on November 1st, 2022. Since then, in November 2023, the <span class="purple"><b>Mononoke Village <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>もののけの里</span></span></b></span> in the northeast was completed. And most centralized and most recently opened in March 2024 is the <span class="magenta"><b>Valley of Witches <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>魔女の谷</span></span></b></span>.</p><p>One of my friends visited the park a year or more ago, and said it wasn't all that special, but this is absolutely not the case. Seeing the scale of these areas in person is incredible. Climbing to the scenic lookout point, prior to the park's opening, and peering down at a life-size replica of Howl's Moving Castle brought up feelings that I didn't know I had.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" /></a></p><p>DAMN. That's it. That's fricken it! The madmen did it!</p><div class='title'><b>Tickets</b></div><p>Tickets for the Ghibli Park are all purchased in advance, online through Lawson. There are 4 different types of tickets available, with different levels of access to the park. The main tickets are purchases 2 months in advance, but there are last-minute tickets you can buy within 7 days prior to visit.</p><p>The standard ticket is the Grand Sanpo Pass, or Grand Walking Pass. This pass allows entrance to all four outdoor areas of Ghibli Park, and gives a specific entrance time to the Ghibli Warehouse. When you buy the ticket, the time you're choosing is when you can enter the Warehouse. You can enter any of the outside areas at anytime throughout the day. Tickets are 3500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.</p><p>The second ticket is the Grand Sanpo Premium Pass. This also has a specific time for the Warehouse and allows entrance to all four outdoor areas. The Premium part allows entrance to specific buildings inside of the areas, including Mei & Satsuki's Home, the Earth Antique Store, Okino's Residence, the Witch's Home, and Howl's Moving Castle. Without a premium pass, you cannot enter these buildings. This ticket is 7300<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.</p><p>There's a third ticket which only includes access to Mononoke Village, The Valley of Witches, and all buildings in the Valley of Witches. Because these two areas are recent additions to the Ghibli Park, they created a new ticket just for people who had visited in the first year. This ticket is 3300<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>, and I think it will only be available temporarily for a little while longer.</p><p>The final type of ticket is the last-minute Sanpo Pass. This ticket can only be purchased 7 days before your arrival, and it only includes the 4 outdoor areas of the park. There's no access to buildings, and no access to the Ghibli Warehouse. Also, you only have 3 hours to use your tickets to enter the areas. This ticket is only 1500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>.</p><p>I purchased the 3500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span> Grand Sanpo Pass for November 1st, the 2-year anniversary of the park's opening. The Premium Pass sold out too quickly for me to buy, but there seemed like a lot to do already. There were so many places to go and see. I wanted this trip to be more of a dry run rather than an exhaustive one. My warehouse entry time was Noon.</p><div class='title'><b>Open and Opening</b></div><p>Despite Ghibli Park's website clearly stating that there is absolutely no parking, there was plenty of parking. I think they state this based on a technicality that Ghibli Park itself has no dedicated parking, but the Expo Park has plenty. </p><p>While Ghibli Park is the main draw (and often only draw) for the Expo Park, Ghibli Park still treats itself part of the area, rather than the whole thing. As such, the park is almost completely open. I arrived at around 8:30am, well before the 10am opening time. I was planning on sitting in my car, and going through photos. But, so many people were walking in after they parked.</p><p>Unlike a typical theme park or museum, there is no gate, and no perimeter closing the park off to people who didn't have tickets.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The bell tower elevator was completely open. Just hop in, and go down to the park area without showing a ticket or anything. I kept looking around for where I needed to scan my ticket or what I needed to do.</p><p>Each of the specific areas of Ghibli Park are ticketed, but the entire park itself is completely open. You don't need a ticket to walk around the park! Plus, there are a lot of things you can do and see without even having a ticket.</p><p>Opening around 9am was the observation point. I walked up to the top, and it gave a full view of the Valley of Witches, the newest and largest addition to the park. Again, no ticket required.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>No one was yet around, but some of the buildings were being prepared for today's crowds.</p><p>From the observation point, I walked down through the other path which led to the Mononoke Village. I got yelled at for entering the area even though it was all open. So, I walked around the park for a while and got a good idea of the overall layout. I came back at 10am, and gained entry.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="purple">Mononoke Village <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>もものけの里</span></span></span></b></div><p>The Mononoke Village is an open area designed to look like the Emishi village at the beginning of the film. There is a path that cuts through rice fields, with the village's lookout tower, destroyed when the demon Nago attacks the village.

This is where I bought the button.</p><div class='title'><b><span class="light_blue">Hill of Youth <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>青春の丘</span></span></span></b></div><p>The final area that I had yet to visit was the Hill of Youth.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There are two buildings here. The main one is the antique shop from Whisper of the Heart. The ground floor is filled with antiques, and the second floor is filled with mechanical clocks and materials for creating violins. The inside of the building is premium only, and the gift shop is inside, too. In order to get my final button, I had to ask one of attendants and she escorted me inside to the store to quickly buy it.</p><p>The other building of the Hill of Youth is the Cat Office from The Cat Returns, the spin-off film to Whisper of the Heart. It's a small "cat-sized" building you can only view by peering through the windows. Inside, the Baron meets with Muta.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Without a premium pass, this area is pretty empty.</p><div class='title'><b>Ghibli Park</b></div><p>Overall, Ghibli Park is pretty incredible.

But, in Nintendo fashion, they didn't want to just make a boring museum. The museum has three main areas: a showcase of Nintendo history, an interactive play area with unique games, and a cafe and workshop.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp"></a></p><p>The Nintendo Museum has been open for a month now. Tickets are given by lottery, so you sign up for 3 available times and if you're selected, you can buy tickets. One of my choices was for Halloween, and I was selected. :)</p><p>Since before its opening on October 1st, they had a press day and allowed several content creators to run amok in the place. The entire museum has been cataloged with tons of photos and videos online. Watching all that stuff can prepare you for the museum. But, in my case, it put my expectations too high on what I wanted.  Overall, <b>the museum was just okay.</b></p><p>Here is some advice for the museum, if you plan on visiting. Note: The museum hours are 10am to 5pm, and my entry time was 1pm.</p><div class='title'><b>Pointers for the Store</b></div><p>Go to the store immediately when you arrive.</p><p>Those controller cushions only have a limited amount available each day. I saw people walking around having bought some, but I don't know if they had been there all day and got them at 11am or Noon or something. I don't know if you have to say some password to someone to get one. I entered the store around 2pm maybe, and I circled around quite a bit and saw nothing.</p><p>The controller cushions aren't as big as they look. The Wii one is the longest at maybe 3 feet. I was interested in the Super Famicom controller, but it was probably 2 feet wide. Pretty small.</p><p>The controller cushions are also limited to one per person among all four types. Additionally, the tiny plastic controller replicas are also limited one per person. They had some of those left when I arrived, so I decided to get one and roll the dice. (I got a VB controller lol)</p><p>A bunch of other stuff was sold out in the store. Apparently, all those tiny controller keychains sold out around 3pm. They also didn't have any of the high end Hanafuda cards. They were missing some other stuff too.</p><p>Stuff is expensive, too. Shirts are 5500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>. They did have some Ultra Hands, but there were 7500<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>. Very few single items were under 2000<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>円</span></span>. Also, unlike the Nintendo Store, you couldn't get points with your Nintendo Account.</p><p>Anyways, I bought a lanyard for my Nintendo card, the cheap hanafuda set, and one controller keychain.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Pointers for Hanafuda</b></div><p>Sign up for Hanafuda immediately when you arrive. Sign-ups are right next to the store by the entrance.</p><p>You can only sign up for the workshop and hanafuda sessions within 2-3 hours of your entry time. So, if you decide later that you might want to do it, all the times available to you will be sold out.</p><p>I was still able to do the Hanafuda painting session, but I couldn't do the learning/play session. It's fine, though. Like many of the amusement games, it looked like it was best played with 2 people.</p><p>The painting and making hanafuda cards was pretty fun. I have some pointers on how I could probably make mine look better for next time, but I will refrain from mentioning them.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Pointers</b></div><p>I would say those are the two biggest things to pay attention to. The museum and amusement areas won't take you too long to go through, and they'll always be available for you. If you buy stuff first, it's not too difficult to lug around bags of stuff either.</p><p>As a smaller point: outside of the museum, there is nothing else around at all. This land must've been super cheap or the only thing available in the area because it's next to a Mazda dealership, a supermarket, and a bookstore. There's also a bicycle shop, and a couple other empty plots of land.</p><p>Also, if you're driving, there is scattered parking around the area. But driving in Kyoto is fucking terrible. Roads are narrower than most cities and there are too many cars. You could probably park at the Tsutaya? I think that's all paid parking, so why not?</p><div class='title'><b>The Museum</b></div><p>I arrived at the museum 2 hours early. Went to a Book Off down the road. Then walked around for a while. I eventually just sat in front of the museum with an hour left to kill. They let me in 15 minutes early. After going through the entrance, security screens, and baggage check, I was in.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Not really knowing what to do first, I followed the signs and went to the 2nd floor museum. No photos allowed.</p><p>The 2nd floor showcased Nintendo prominent 40-year video game history with huge displays of each console generation and boxes from each of the 3 major regions of release: Japan, America, and Europe. They also had a sales ratio breakdown of each region, too. Nintendo 64 and Gamecube were huge in America making over half the overall total sales. The Nintendo DS had Japan take over half the total sales, too.</p><p>It was neat, but...  It didn't really impress me or move me. So many people around me were going, "Oh wow, do you remember this?" "Oh man, this is so cool." But me... I guess I already had these waves of Nintendo nostalgia wash over me thanks to the Analogue Pocket and Mister FPGA consoles, and the Super Nintendo Mini. Also, I already saw a bunch of these games at Book Off a few hours ago.</p><p>It's not really nostalgia when this stuff is so ever present in my mind.</p><div class='title'><b>Prototypes</b></div><p>This most interesting thing in the museum was off in the far corner. Behind a glass walled room were some haphazard displays of console prototypes. They had the original prototypes of Wii-motes, the gamecube, gameboy, Nintendo DS, Wii balance board, the Switch. This was actual lesser know or seen history.</p><p>Behind them was a Donkey Kong arcade game, a few other arcade games, and shelves and shelves of other hardware or sales merchandise sitting in boxes. This led into an area that was roped off.</p><p>Once they go through this initial batch of ticket holders, maybe they'll collect all this stuff into an actual exhibition room.</p><div class='title'><b>Interactive Arcade</b></div><p>All areas of the Nintendo Museum were open, so you can go downstairs whenever you wanted, play some games, and then return upstairs.</p><p>Your Nintendo Museum ticket doubles as a play pass for all the games on the 1st floor. To play a game, you tap your pass and register to play the game. You have 10 coins total (cannot be refilled). Each game took certain amounts of coins. It is not possible to play everything, but you can still play a lot. The games go by pretty quickly, and Several games require two players.</p><div class='title'><b>Giant Controllers</b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I immediately noticed that Dr Mario was available on the giant Famicom controller, so that's where my first coins went. <b>Pointers?</b> These controllers are actually giant. I have a pretty big arm span, but it was not possible to play with just one person. Also, it required two accounts to register, so you couldn't sign up yourself. I had one of the staff members help me out.</p><p>They only give you 5 minutes, and they start you at level 1. Me and the dude made it to level 2, but it went by so fast. Oh well, it was fun. :)</p><p>It used 2 coins</p><p class='img'><ul class="museum-list"><li class="museum-header">Use Date : 2024-October-31 (Thu)</li><li class="item"><div class="img"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" /></div><div class="content"><p>13:12 (Asia/Tokyo)</p><p>Big Controller</p></div></li><li class="item column"><p>Controller</p><p class="title">Family Computer</p></li><li class="item column"><p>Game</p><p class="title">Dr. Mario</p></li><li class="item data"><p>Level Reached</p><p class="content">2</p></li><li class="item data"><p>Score</p><p class="content">1,000 pts.</p></li><li class="item photos"><p>Photos</p><div><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" /></a><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" /></a><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" /></a></div></li></ul><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Zapper & Super Scoper SP</b></div><p>I walked around and looked at other games.

I got in line and it didn't take too long for my turn.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp"></a></p><p>The Zapper game is a 12-player shooting gallery game where everyone chooses to use either a Zapper or a Super Scope. There are 3 rounds with various Mario enemy characters appearing, and you shoot down as many as you can.</p><p><b>Pointers?</b> One key thing about learning how to play this is being able to watch the groups in front of you play their games. Everyone's score is tallied and there's an overall Gold, Silver, and Bronze winner of the game.</p><p>When it was my group's turn, I immediately noticed that you could shoot anywhere on the screen. You are not limited to the area in front of you. You could shoot way down to the other side of the screen if you wanted. </p><p>Knowing this, as the enemies appeared, I shoot down everything that appeared in front of the people beside me first before turning my attention to stuff in front of me. I was in booth #5, so I could clear out lots of enemies from booths #1-#4 and still have stuff left going from #5 and up.</p><p>Also, Blue turtles give you +3 points each.</p><p>Anyways, I got first place with 215 points. :) I did not see what the second place score was.</p><p class='img'><ul class="museum-list"><li class="museum-header">Use Date : 2024-October-31 (Thu)</li><li class="item"><div class="img"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" /></div><div class="content"><p>13:32 (Asia/Tokyo)</p><p>Zapper & Score SP</p></div></li><li class="item data"><p>Controller</p><p class="content">Zapper</p></li><li class="item data"><p>Stage 1 Score</p><p class="content">106 pts.</p></li><li class="item data"><p>Stage 2 Score</p><p class="content">59 pts.</p></li><li class="item data"><p>Stage 3 Score</p><p class="content">50 pts.</p></li><li class="item data"><p>Overall Score</p><p class="content">215 pts.</p></li><li class="item column"><p>Trophies</p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp"/></li></ul><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Ultra Hand</b></div><p>Next, I did the Ultra Hand game.

You close the arms together, like gardening sheers, to close the gripping hands on the end. Then you open the hand to bring it back. </p><p>The hands will close and always stay closed. You need to clamp down hard (very hard) on the string so it doesn't move, which will pull open the hands on the end. You may feel like you're clamping down on the string hard enough, but it easily slips through the plastic. You need to crush down on it.</p><p>Once the staff member explained that to me completely, I was totally ready. The game was competitive in a group of 4 people. Once again, I got first in my group.

The light colors were too light, so I used more paint and it went everywhere. The dark colors were too dark, so those parts are completely blacked out.

Nah... Although, maybe I should've just torpedoed my project at the first sign of trouble to make something more unique. Eh, it's fine. I learned how traditional hanafuda cards were made, and learned a little bit more about what hanafuda is.</p><div class='title'><b>Expectations</b></div><p>Overall, I spent about 3 1/2 hours at the Nintendo Museum, which felt like stretching the most out of my time there. I left there somewhat disappointed in the experience. That's it?</p><p>Although, writing about it is a bit cathartic. I actually did kinda do a lot there after all. How long do you usually stay at museums? 3 1/2 hours is pretty decent after all.</p><p>Over time, I think they'll add more to the museum. More games downstairs perhaps? A new exhibit upstairs to fill that empty back space?</p><p>More businesses might move to the area too, filling up those vacant nearby lots.</p><p>I'd like to go back in a year or two with some friends. :)<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Emperor and The Imperial Palace 皇居" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/emperor-and-the-imperial-palace">Emperor and The Imperial Palace 皇居</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

This was announced to the nation on August 15th, 1945, seventy-nine years ago. In the following days, officers of the United States military came to Japan, and oversaw the occupation which would rebuild Japan.</p><p>In these first few days, the American public wanted immediately and swift revenge for Pearl Harbor and Japan's involvement in the war. It was easy to place a target on the figurehead of Japan, Emperor Hirohito. To the typical American, the Emperor was like a king, and a king commands its armies to attack. So, surely Emperor Hirohito commanded Japan's army and navy to attack Pearl Harbor and enter the war.</p><p>As Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to lead the occupation, one of his first assignments was given to General Bonner Fellers. This assignment was to determine the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the war. Did he give the command to attack? Did he give the command to invade?</p><p>This is the overall plot of the 2012 film, Emperor, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Douglas MacArthur and Matthew Fox as Bonner Fellers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp"/></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp"/></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>General Bonner Fellers</b></div><p>The film focuses on Bonner Fellers.

Fellers (and Matthew Fox's acting) clearly shows a love and respect for Japan, but he is constantly beat down, turned away, and disrespected by its people. He understands the damned future Japan would have without an Emperor, so he continues to fight for the answers despite the constant problems. </p><p>This feeling of frustration is the initial reason why this film stayed with me. I immediately identified with these feelings having lived here for a few years when seeing it for the first time. This feeling of working towards the same goal as others, but being pushed aside because I'm a perceived outsider, thus being perceived as an opponent or someone that wouldn't understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Honne and Tatemae <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>本音と建前</span></span></b></div><p>After watching the film recently with my Japanese language students, I had forgotten that it spent some time explaining Japanese culture. One of the key points of the film was a flashback between Fellers and his fictional girlfriend's uncle, General Kajima. The uncle explains <b>Honne</b> and <b>Tatemae</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp"></a></p><p><b>Tatemae</b> is the way that things appear. The uncle explains to Fellers that when you look at Japan (in 1930s/40s), you see the most advanced and westernized country in all of Asia. <b>Honne</b> is the way they really are. Underneath this westernized surface is the true heartbeat of Japan, which runs on the ancient warrior code of loyalty and obedience. From this explanation that Fellers learned before the war, he understands that without the Emperor as a symbol to guide the public, Japan would fall into chaos.</p><p>This concept of Honne and Tatemae is ever present in modern Japan. They consider and cherish group harmony over everything else. They do this because on the surface conflict will create rifts between individuals and eventually break that harmony. So, they often contribute and conform to the group to avoid social strife. This is why everyone perceives Japanese people as super nice and accommodating.</p><p>That's not to say Japanese don't complain. When they do complain, they complain to their own social circles about something outside of it. It's often a way to bring people in their circle together. And if they complain more outwardly (like on Twitter), it's as an individual completely detached from their circles.</p><p>Maybe this sounds obvious and not really foreign to America, but it's something that foreign people who come to Japan often struggle with, especially when a Japanese person says one thing, but then does the opposite. The classic example is being invited to someone's home. They'll say, "You should come over to my house." They'll often do this as way to be nice and create harmony, but usually they expect you to decline, something like, "Oh, I'd love to some day." They don't want you to say, "Ok, when?"</p><div class='title'><b>Group Harmony formed from Ancient History</b></div><p>I don't remember if the subject was Honne and Tatemae, but one of my college professors once mentioned that the culture of group harmony and being nice was born from being such a small country with limited resources. </p><p>Japan has very clear natural outer borders, and plenty of mountains creating internal borders, too. Space for creating towns with agriculture was limited to few areas. Self-sustaining communities didn't have a lot of extra food, so if you stole from your neighbors or created problems, you would be banished from the town. Other towns and settlements also had limited resources, so they wouldn't just accept an outsider. And even if you proved your worth, they would still be wary of accepting you completely.</p><p>As such, this created the culture of group harmony above self interests. And, this is perhaps how the idea of Honne and Tatemae was formed.</p><p>Compare this to Western Europe and modern-day Americans. Our civilizations have always been formed from expanding our borders into uncharted areas. Greeks and Romans established their cities and expanded to conquer new ones. Americans broke away from Europe and expanded and "conquered" North America. </p><p>In America in the Wild West, if we stole from our neighbor and pissed off people, it wouldn't matter if we were banished. We could easily pick a direction and find new fertile land to start a new farm. People were constantly traveling to new places, so there was always new work available, and people dealt with problems head on.</p><div class='title'><b>Direct and Indirect Language</b></div><p>You could also say that the insular culture of Japan and expansive culture of America and Europe influenced both Japanese and English languages.</p><p>In general, English is a very direct language compared to Japanese, which is built into our grammar. Our sentences always begin with the subject followed by the verb.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.</code></p><p>We always want to know <code>who</code> is doing <code>what</code> when we talk. All the other details of the sentence follow afterwards, when, why, where, how often, with whom, etc.</p><p>Japanese starts with the subject, too, although it's often not needed if the subject of conversation is clear. All the other details are expressed first before concluding the sentence with the verb.</p><p><code><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>私は</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>毎日</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>学校に</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>歩いて行きます。</span></span></code></p><p>You could say that a speaker wants to create a full picture of a situation first before completing and ending their thought. Comparing to English, we get the most important information said immediately, and the listener can then decide on the importance of the later details.</p><p>Going back to the earlier example of inviting someone...  In English, if you wanted to refuse someone's invitation, it's perfectly fine to just say no. "Hey, would you like to come over this weekend?" "Sorry, I can't." You wouldn't necessarily need to provide any context. In Japanese, though, outright refusing an invitation with such a direct response could be considered rude. "<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>すみません、ちょっと。。</span></span>" "This weekend is not good for me." "I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement." You want to make a nice soft rejection sandwich.</p><p>The idea of culture or cognition influencing language or language influencing culture or cognition is the central focus in another one of my favorite movies: <a href="/old/v7/arrival" title="/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.</p><p>Anyways... back to Emperor.</p><div class='title'><b>Dai-Ichi Life Building <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>第一生命</span></span></b></div><p>As Douglas MacArthur and Bonner Fellers arrived in Tokyo, their offices were set up in the Dai-Ichi Life building, across the moat from the Imperial Palace grounds.

Some of the smaller ones have been covered already, but the biggest inaccuracy is the love story between Fellers and Shimada Aya. Their story is completely fictional as Fellers was already married to Dorothy Dysart in 1925. They stayed married with 3 children until Feller's death in 1973.</p><p>The overall love story was most likely added to make the story relatable to general audience. Do people really want another boring historical drama based on facts? If Fellers has "love" for Japan, we gotta show that love somehow. Love for a woman is the easiest way to do this.

I was the second person in line starting at 8:00am. The other dude said he arrived around 7:30am.</p><p>My friends showed up around 8:45am with around 120 people in the line? So, ultimately, I didn't have to be so afraid of missing this chance. But, it was alright. Around 9:30am, they allowed tour members to enter the Kikyo-mon Gate and wait at the visitor center for orientation. They explained the route of the tour, and had pamphlets available. Tour guides were available in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Although, you could also scan a QR code to listen to all the details yourself. A small gift shop was also located in the visitor center, so you can buy random stuff with the imperial seal on it. I bought a small guidebook.</p><p>Here are scan of pamphlets and that guidebook:</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Shortened Tour</b></div><p>Given the summer heat, tours were only offered in the morning, and the tour today was cut short.

Perhaps both a semi-wide shot and a zoomed-in close up. You might need a camera with a strong zoom lens. Then, put your friend or partner on the tour. Have them wait around until the tour clears the bridge so they're the last person off the bridge. As they exit, face the camera for a couple good shots.</p><p>It would take a bit of preparation and patience, but it could be worth it. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Tour</b></div><p>Overall, the tour was fine. Sharing the tour with 300+ people means barely being able to hear the tour guide over constant talking. Everyone was taking the same photos, too, so not particularly unique. Occasionally, someone would step on something forbidden and get yelled at. Once or twice, it seemed like someone important was in a car that drove by.</p><p>The Imperial Palace reminds me a lot of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Both are the center pieces of ancient government in their cities, but they aren't represented by a massive multi-storied castle like Himeiji or Matsumoto. Though, I suppose the Emperor would want to be shown as modest. The Emperor of Japan isn't known for flaunting wealth and status over the citizens of their country.</p><p>I suppose the East Palace Gardens are meant to show off the beauty of the palace. Those are also within the palace grounds, but are freely open to the public most days. We skipped that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ultimately, I think the view of Fushimi-yagura with the Sei-mon Gate and bridges together ends up the most scenic area of the palace, which is probably why the used it for the film. If you have time, I think the tour is worthwhile, but if you only have a few days in Tokyo and time is short, you could take a look around the outside and be satisfied enough. :)<br/></p></p></div></div><div id="post-1085" class="post"><h2><a title="Permanent Link to Square Enix Cafe" rel="bookmark" href="/old/v7/square-enix-cafe">Square Enix Cafe</a></h2><p class="postmetadata">

I'm using the GameBoy Camera Plus mod created by 2BitToy, which takes the inner circuits from a GameBoy Camera and puts them into a new shell with a CS Mount lens adapter. This allows you to use far more powerful lenses than the original.

On my way back home up to Hida, I took some reverse photos looking back at the mountain and the castle.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5102_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231001_wind_castle/IMG_5107_t.webp" /></a></div><br/></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>The white castle blends into the sky very easily. If you didn't know it was there, you would never notice it. But, once you know that it's there and where to look, it pops out.</p><p>There's also not a whole lot of information about the Wind Castle online. In fact, my friend and I only found this thing by skimming around Toyama in Google Maps looking for something to do. I wanted to know exactly when they built this thing, and its purpose. </p><p>There's a plaque on the Wind Caste which states the following: <br/><b><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>平成</span></span>2<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>年度</span></span></b> <I>Heisei-2 (or 1990)</I><br/><b><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>中部通商産業局</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>地域エネルギー開発利用発電モデル事業</span></span></b> <I>Chubu Bureau of International Trade and Industry Regional Energy Development Utilization Power Generation Model Project</I><br/><b><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>「風の城</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>風力エネルギー開発利用事業」</span></span></b><I>"The Wind Castle - Wind Energy Development Utilization Project"</I><br/><b>-<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>富山県大沢野町</span></span></b> <I>- Osawano Town, Toyama Prefecture.</I></p><p>Quite a mouthful. Seems like it was built in 1990, although I wanted to find more substantial information online. Eventually I did find a blog post of someone talking about Sarukura castle (explained earlier), and a few other things. In particular, in 1975, as part of Toyama prefecture's 100th year anniversary, a 9.6km trail was opened from Mt. Sarukura to Mt. Kosami Gozen <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>小佐波御前山</span></span>. It didn't mention anything about the Wind Castle at that time. </p><p>I didn't find anything that confirmed its opening in 1990. But, it was probably built in 1990 as its architecture and flashy nature seems to fit that time well. Like everything built during the economic high times of the 80s and 90s in Japan, it is definitely showing wear and tear from the years. Some of the windows have been kicked out, and the metal railing has graffiti almost everywhere. One of the door had been kicked in, too.</p><p>If you've never been, I would absolutely recommend driving up here if you're going to or from Toyama. I will probably return here each time I visit Toyama now. Different weather, different season, and different time of day will all create a new view. :)<br/></p></p></div></div><div class="navigation"><div class="alignleft"><a href="/old/v7/travel/2">« Previous Entries</a></div><div class="alignright"></div></div></div><div id="sidebar"><ul><li><h3>Categories</h3><ul><li class="cat-item"><a rel="category" title="View all posts in America" href="/old/v7/america">America</a> (27)
