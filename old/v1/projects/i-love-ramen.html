I love the stuff.  It's an entire full meal in itself.  The noodle are the main "meaty" course.  The broth provides an excellent complementary base for the noodles.  And there's little bits of veggies, eggs or meat for variety.</p><p>Though, it wasn't until a year or so into college, when I first stepped into the Asian Market in Minneapolis, that I became such a Ramen freak.  Previously, I had consumed the crappy Maruchan stuff found in grocers.  But when came upon the vast selection of the Asian Market, I was utterly stunned.  An entire aisle, filled both sides full of almost one hundred different kinds of Ramen.  My senses were momentarily overloaded.  I figured they would have more selection and better quality Ramen, but I had no idea what I was getting myself into.</p><p>I did the only logical thing I could think of.  I bought one of every different brand and flavor they had.  The store clerk wasn't very happy when I set a few hand-baskets full of single packs on his counter full Ramen that were all different.  $50 bought me two months worth of food!</p><p>With each and every Ramen pack I made, I wrote down my thoughts on my blog, and scored each one.  It was my quest to figure out which was the best Ramen of them all.  Throughout those 2 months, which was actually closer to 3 or 4 since I didn't eat Ramen every single day, I worked my way through some pretty mediocre products.  You can find most of these reviews in my archives, somewhere around 2003.</p><p>I did eventually find the two best kinds of Instant Ramen ever made..  but I had learned a lot along the way.  What makes the best Ramen?  How does cost factor into the decision?  What sort of things added to the Ramen really bring out the taste?  What else can I do with Ramen outside of the simple instructions?</p><div class='title'><b>Ode to Ramen, collage</b></div><p>For every pack of Ramen I ate, I kept the packaging.  I laid the package on my desk, and placed several books on top to flatten them.  After I completed my task of finding the best Ramen, I created a collage of my journey.</p><p>Though, I guess as an Ode to Finding the best Ramen, it doesn't really work at all.  But it does show the frantic over-sensitized decision I had to originally make when I found myself in the Ramen aisle.  So many choices!  Which one is it?!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp"  /></p><p>By the way, the Answer can be found in the lower left hand side, <b>Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun</b> (which is Korean and may no longer exist), and on the left hand side, <b>Mama's Tomyun Shrimp</b> (which is Thai and can be found at Copps).</p><div class='title'><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen</b></div><p>Of course, none of those can compare to actual Ramen in Japan.  And especially Hakata Ramen found on the streets of Fukuoka, Japan after night fall.  I ate a shit load of Ramen with studying abroad in Nagasaki, Japan.  Some from franchises, some from street vendors, and even some new Instant flavors I hadn't tried before.</p><p>When deciding on a topic for my "final" history project, I lept at the chance to cover Ramen.  And I did so in the form of verse.  Thanks to links on Wikipedia and general Google searching, finding enough information to form a timeline was pretty easy.  Though, I still ended up at the local Internet Cafe quite late, trying to pull everything together.</p><p>I wrote my script, and rocked the microphone hard!!  Here ya go!</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MNDVnRVplUnNfNDg/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MNDVnRVplUnNfNDg/edit?usp=sharing"><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen - 5 min 42 sec</b></a></p><p>If I knew piano, I would probably re-record this lovable "poem" with a nice beat.  "Dr. Suess' Ramen Piano Bar Remix"  Maybe someday in the future.</p><p>This was recorded near the end of 2006.  Unfortunately, just 5 days into January 2007, the creator of Instant Ramen, <b>Momofuku Ando</b>, went to that big Cup 'o Noodle in the sky at age 96.  Ninety-fucking-six!  Ando truly proves that Ramen is the secret to a long and full life. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics</b></div><p><em>The is the history of instant noodles or Ramen<br/>A food product which is quite common</em></p><p><em>It is everyone's favorite noodle dish<br/>Though the term itself, is rather ambiguous<br/></em></p><p><em>In America, the term "Ramen" refers to Instant Noodles<br/>Popular among
