This was announced to the nation on August 15th, 1945, seventy-nine years ago. In the following days, officers of the United States military came to Japan, and oversaw the occupation which would rebuild Japan.</p><p>In these first few days, the American public wanted immediately and swift revenge for Pearl Harbor and Japan's involvement in the war. It was easy to place a target on the figurehead of Japan, Emperor Hirohito. To the typical American, the Emperor was like a king, and a king commands its armies to attack. So, surely Emperor Hirohito commanded Japan's army and navy to attack Pearl Harbor and enter the war.</p><p>As Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to lead the occupation, one of his first assignments was given to General Bonner Fellers. This assignment was to determine the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the war. Did he give the command to attack? Did he give the command to invade?</p><p>This is the overall plot of the 2012 film, Emperor, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Douglas MacArthur and Matthew Fox as Bonner Fellers.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp"/></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp"/></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>General Bonner Fellers</b></div><p>The film focuses on Bonner Fellers.

After arriving in Tokyo, various members of the Japanese military are arrested, and Fellers oversees the operation understanding how these officers value sacrifice in the wake of defeat.</p><p>The arrested officers are interrogated and seemingly uncooperative.

Fellers (and Matthew Fox's acting) clearly shows a love and respect for Japan, but he is constantly beat down, turned away, and disrespected by its people. He understands the damned future Japan would have without an Emperor, so he continues to fight for the answers despite the constant problems. </p><p>This feeling of frustration is the initial reason why this film stayed with me. I immediately identified with these feelings having lived here for a few years when seeing it for the first time. This feeling of working towards the same goal as others, but being pushed aside because I'm a perceived outsider, thus being perceived as an opponent or someone that wouldn't understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Honne and Tatemae <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>æ¬é³ã¨å»ºå</span></span></b></div><p>After watching the film recently with my Japanese language students, I had forgotten that it spent some time explaining Japanese culture. One of the key points of the film was a flashback between Fellers and his fictional girlfriend's uncle, General Kajima. The uncle explains <b>Honne</b> and <b>Tatemae</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp"></a></p><p><b>Tatemae</b> is the way that things appear. The uncle explains to Fellers that when you look at Japan (in 1930s/40s), you see the most advanced and westernized country in all of Asia. <b>Honne</b> is the way they really are. Underneath this westernized surface is the true heartbeat of Japan, which runs on the ancient warrior code of loyalty and obedience. From this explanation that Fellers learned before the war, he understands that without the Emperor as a symbol to guide the public, Japan would fall into chaos.</p><p>This concept of Honne and Tatemae is ever present in modern Japan. They consider and cherish group harmony over everything else. They do this because on the surface conflict will create rifts between individuals and eventually break that harmony. So, they often contribute and conform to the group to avoid social strife. This is why everyone perceives Japanese people as super nice and accommodating.</p><p>That's not to say Japanese don't complain. When they do complain, they complain to their own social circles about something outside of it. It's often a way to bring people in their circle together. And if they complain more outwardly (like on Twitter), it's as an individual completely detached from their circles.</p><p>Maybe this sounds obvious and not really foreign to America, but it's something that foreign people who come to Japan often struggle with, especially when a Japanese person says one thing, but then does the opposite. The classic example is being invited to someone's home. They'll say, "You should come over to my house." They'll often do this as way to be nice and create harmony, but usually they expect you to decline, something like, "Oh, I'd love to some day." They don't want you to say, "Ok, when?"</p><div class='title'><b>Group Harmony formed from Ancient History</b></div><p>I don't remember if the subject was Honne and Tatemae, but one of my college professors once mentioned that the culture of group harmony and being nice was born from being such a small country with limited resources. </p><p>Japan has very clear natural outer borders, and plenty of mountains creating internal borders, too. Space for creating towns with agriculture was limited to few areas. Self-sustaining communities didn't have a lot of extra food, so if you stole from your neighbors or created problems, you would be banished from the town. Other towns and settlements also had limited resources, so they wouldn't just accept an outsider. And even if you proved your worth, they would still be wary of accepting you completely.</p><p>As such, this created the culture of group harmony above self interests. And, this is perhaps how the idea of Honne and Tatemae was formed.</p><p>Compare this to Western Europe and modern-day Americans. Our civilizations have always been formed from expanding our borders into uncharted areas. Greeks and Romans established their cities and expanded to conquer new ones. Americans broke away from Europe and expanded and "conquered" North America. </p><p>In America in the Wild West, if we stole from our neighbor and pissed off people, it wouldn't matter if we were banished. We could easily pick a direction and find new fertile land to start a new farm. People were constantly traveling to new places, so there was always new work available, and people dealt with problems head on.</p><div class='title'><b>Direct and Indirect Language</b></div><p>You could also say that the insular culture of Japan and expansive culture of America and Europe influenced both Japanese and English languages.</p><p>In general, English is a very direct language compared to Japanese, which is built into our grammar. Our sentences always begin with the subject followed by the verb.</p><p><code>I walk to school everyday.</code></p><p>We always want to know <code>who</code> is doing <code>what</code> when we talk. All the other details of the sentence follow afterwards, when, why, where, how often, with whom, etc.</p><p>Japanese starts with the subject, too, although it's often not needed if the subject of conversation is clear. All the other details are expressed first before concluding the sentence with the verb.</p><p><code><span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ç§ã¯</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>æ¯æ¥</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>å­¦æ ¡ã«</span></span> <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>æ­©ãã¦è¡ãã¾ãã</span></span></code></p><p>You could say that a speaker wants to create a full picture of a situation first before completing and ending their thought. Comparing to English, we get the most important information said immediately, and the listener can then decide on the importance of the later details.</p><p>Going back to the earlier example of inviting someone...  In English, if you wanted to refuse someone's invitation, it's perfectly fine to just say no. "Hey, would you like to come over this weekend?" "Sorry, I can't." You wouldn't necessarily need to provide any context. In Japanese, though, outright refusing an invitation with such a direct response could be considered rude. "<span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ãã¿ã¾ãããã¡ãã£ã¨ãã</span></span>" "This weekend is not good for me." "I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement." You want to make a nice soft rejection sandwich.</p><p>The idea of culture or cognition influencing language or language influencing culture or cognition is the central focus in another one of my favorite movies: <a href="/arrival" title="/arrival" title="/arrival">Arrival</a>.</p><p>Anyways... back to Emperor.</p><div class='title'><b>Dai-Ichi Life Building <span class='ja'><span class='ja'>ç¬¬ä¸çå½</span></span></b></div><p>As Douglas MacArthur and Bonner Fellers arrived in Tokyo, their offices were set up in the Dai-Ichi Life building, across the moat from the Imperial Palace grounds. From a story perspective, the location is perfectly fine, but the imagery and location are factual incorrect, and the location sometimes seems to move depending on what's happening in the film.</p><p>We see the Dai-Ichi Life building in the first sequence of the film as MacArthur and Fellers arrive.

And they began handing out numbers and applications at 9:00am.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Not wanting to miss the chance of taking a tour of the palace grounds, I showed up around 7:20am to take photos of the Dai-Ichi Life building, walk to the Sei-mon Gate as Fellers did in the film, take more photos, and then walk to the Kikyo-mon Gate where the line-up began. I was the second person in line starting at 8:00am. The other dude said he arrived around 7:30am.</p><p>My friends showed up around 8:45am with around 120 people in the line? So, ultimately, I didn't have to be so afraid of missing this chance. But, it was alright. Around 9:30am, they allowed tour members to enter the Kikyo-mon Gate and wait at the visitor center for orientation. They explained the route of the tour, and had pamphlets available. Tour guides were available in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Although, you could also scan a QR code to listen to all the details yourself. A small gift shop was also located in the visitor center, so you can buy random stuff with the imperial seal on it. I bought a small guidebook.</p><p>Here are scan of pamphlets and that guidebook:</p><p class='img'><div class="threeColumns"><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" /></a></div><div class="column"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" /></a></div><div class="column threeColumnLast"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>Shortened Tour</b></div><p>Given the summer heat, tours were only offered in the morning, and the tour today was cut short.

Perhaps both a semi-wide shot and a zoomed-in close up. You might need a camera with a strong zoom lens. Then, put your friend or partner on the tour. Have them wait around until the tour clears the bridge so they're the last person off the bridge. As they exit, face the camera for a couple good shots.</p><p>It would take a bit of preparation and patience, but it could be worth it. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Tour</b></div><p>Overall, the tour was fine. Sharing the tour with 300+ people means barely being able to hear the tour guide over constant talking. Everyone was taking the same photos, too, so not particularly unique. Occasionally, someone would step on something forbidden and get yelled at. Once or twice, it seemed like someone important was in a car that drove by.</p><p>The Imperial Palace reminds me a lot of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Both are the center pieces of ancient government in their cities, but they aren't represented by a massive multi-storied castle like Himeiji or Matsumoto. Though, I suppose the Emperor would want to be shown as modest. The Emperor of Japan isn't known for flaunting wealth and status over the citizens of their country.</p><p>I suppose the East Palace Gardens are meant to show off the beauty of the palace. Those are also within the palace grounds, but are freely open to the public most days. We skipped that, though.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Ultimately, I think the view of Fushimi-yagura with the Sei-mon Gate and bridges together ends up the most scenic area of the palace, which is probably why the used it for the film. If you have time, I think the tour is worthwhile, but if you only have a few days in Tokyo and time is short, you could take a look around the outside and be satisfied enough. :)<br/></p></p><p align="right"><font size="2">- Dyre - 8.15.2024</font></p></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td><td width="5%">Â </td><td bgcolor="#666666" valign="top" align="center" width="20%"><p>Â </p><p><font size="2"><b>Emperor and The Imperial Palace çå±</b><br/></font></p><p><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/img/old/star1.gif"/></p><p><font size="2">Film &amp; TV</font></p></td></tr></table></div><p align="center"><font size="2"><b>Â© 2001, 2002 <a style="text-decoration: underline;"><font color="#DFDFEA">Schlock</font></a>, All Rights Reserved ... !</b></font></p></div></div></body></html>
