It was really the first time I had taken a "reality" tour for a film.</p><p>Though, the whole trip was shadowed by the overwhelming sense of being watched and unwanted.  People just didn't seem friendly at all.  I was taking some photos and saw some junior high students walking by.  I said, "Hello," and got nothing back.  They just looked at me as if I had no business being there.  Shopkeepers were very short with their dialog, too.</p><p>Perhaps thats because the usual foreigners that visit Taiji knew about the city from the film, so the local people assume they're there to do them harm.</p><p>The town just didn't feel right.  Or perhaps that overwhelming emotional baggage skewed my view of the place.</p><p align="right"><font size="2">- Dyre - March 29, 2016</font></p></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td><td width="5%"> </td><td bgcolor="#222222" valign="top" align="center" width="20%"><p> </p><p><font size="2"><b>The Cove and Taiji, Wakayama 太地町</b><br/></font></p><p><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/></p><p><font size="2">film-tv</font></p></td></tr></table></div><p><font color="#fff" size="2">© 2000 - 2003 . dyre@theschlock.com .
