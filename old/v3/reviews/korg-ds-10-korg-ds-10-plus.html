It was a semi-normal dream for me.  Some friends and I went to some event at a movie studio.  The event was a tribute to Conan O'Brien that showed his legacy on Late Night.  It took place in a parking lot type area.  There were only about 30 of us, and we all sat in desks, like in a classroom.  I sat near the projector, which was also near the speaker, which was somewhat in the middle of all the desks.</p><p>We watched some clips, introduced some acts, and the speaker started playing a piano as Conan O'Brien showed up and started his speech.  In the middle of the speech/musical act, he hopped on the piano bench and tried to play, but could not.  Eventually the original speaker took over, and Conan sat in a desk in front of me.</p><p>He murmured something like, "I guess I should've learned the piano before trying to play."  I mentioned something like, "That's ok.  I don't know how to play either.  Though, I've always wanted to."  To which he retorted, <em>"Well, if you want to play the piano, you should buy one and start playing."</em></p><p>That's about where the dream ended for me.  I woke up with the phrase "Buy a Piano" echoing in my head.  It really reminded me of that episode of Futurama when advertisers implanted product placement in Fry's dreams.  Which WILL happen someday...</p><p>I do want to learn the Piano, but I think there's other things I've already started learning I should specialize in first, such as other facets of Software Development and Japanese Language.  I should probably return to Drawing at some point too...  But music is very much a part of my life.</p><div class='title'><b>Korg DS-10</b></div><p>I really don't have the money or room to buy an actual Piano, but I do already own a music instrument of sorts.  Almost one year ago, XSeed released <b>Korg DS-10</b> in the states, which was originally released in Japan on July 27th, 2008.  Korg is the world leader in synthesizers, but those are pretty expensive and sometimes huge.</p><p>Korg DS-10 is 'software' for your Nintendo DS that mimics the basic functionality of a synthesizer.  It gives you two synth tracks, four drum tracks, and plenty of FX and fades to mix them together, along with a song timeline to bring everything together and actually compose music.</p><p>Thanks to Conan's advice, I actually played around with it for a substantial amount of time last night.  I got the feel of how all the synths and drum synths are laid out, how they interact, and how everything comes together.</p><p>I am an extreme novice when it comes to actually making the music, and everything I did always had the exact same sound.  I tried changing the demo song to be more ambient, but everything I did still kept it in the realm of techno.  Ya know, the whole "unce unce unce" feel.</p><p>Techno is just fine.  Personally, I had a hard time getting away from the demo song (again, I'm a novice), but other people have made some pretty fun songs.</p><p>Such as Jetdaisuke's Express #471:</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vty4pMfJkZ4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Also, the Demo videos on youtube are pretty good too:</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bQcp2Mkt_-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><div class='title'><b>It's kinda simple...</b></div><p>Many of the other songs I came across all follow this style of music, but I want something ambient, progressive, and maybe a little trance, which is the style of Electronica I adore.  Or at least something more complex.</p><p>The third demo video gets closer to this:</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vmIwZDVJSwI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>But, as the video demonstrates, it requires more than the 2 synths and 4 drums on the single Korg DS-10 cart.  You can cluster up to 4 Nintendo DSes and Korg DS-10s for a total of 8 synths and 16 drums, but that's a bit much to spend.  (Especially in Japan where Korg DS-10 was only available through Amazon.co.jp and cost $50 each).</p><div class='title'><b>Korg DS-10 Plus</b></div><p>A year after Korg DS-10 was released in Japan, AGI released Korg DS-10 Plus, which made use out of the recently released Nintendo DSi.  You could still get the same functionality from DS-10 Plus if you used it on a DS, but with the DSi, you effectively doubled your processing power and functionality.</p><p>With the DSi, Korg DS-10 Plus has 4 synths, and 8 drums.  Plus, you can edit your composition while playing in Song mode, which you couldn't do previously.  Korg DS-10 Plus is like having two regular DS-10s in one.</p><p>This really branches the synthesizer into more complex songs with a single cart:</p><p>Such as Magomusume's Mago_004:</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/crax4GSIgR0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>And S_Ishimaru's Millenium:</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lx4r1ro15eg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><div class='title'><b>February 16th!</b></div><p>Korg DS-10 Plus comes out in America in a mere two weeks!  Unlike the release of DS-10, XSeed is planning for a much wider distribution for DS-10 Plus, so you might be able to find it at Best Buy and Wal*mart.  It has all the functionality of the original, with twice the amount of functionality for DSi owners.</p><p>It's not a piano, but it's definitely something.  And it's the cheapest and most portable synthesizer you'll ever buy. ^_^<br/></p><p align="right"><font size="2">- Dyre - February 2, 2010</font></p></div></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td><td width="5%"> </td><td bgcolor="#222222" valign="top" align="center" width="20%"><p> </p><p><font size="2"><b>Korg DS-10 &amp; Korg DS-10 Plus</b><br/></font></p><p><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/><img height="16" width="16" src="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/circle1.gif"/></p><p><font size="2">game-reviews</font></p></td></tr></table></div><p><font color="#fff" size="2">© 2000 - 2003 . dyre@theschlock.com .
