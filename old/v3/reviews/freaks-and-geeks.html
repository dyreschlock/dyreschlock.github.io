I've so many things about this show and after watching Knocked Up and Superbad, I was really excited for it.  We watched about 6 or 7 episodes last night, and watched the remainder of the third disc this morning.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I really thought this show was going to be much more of a comedy than a drama.  I figured it was more on the lines of Undeclared, but I was way off.  I also thought each episode was going to be 30 minutes, but I was off on that too.  There's a lot more to this show than I expected which really through me back..</p><p>Freaks and Geeks is about freaks and geeks..  Set in 1980, it centers on Sam Weir, a freshmen high school who fails into the geek category of the show.  And centers on Lindsey Weir who is a junior or senior at the same high school.  She rejects her 'braininess' and wants to hang out with the 'cool' kids.. the 'freaks' category, which would be burnouts.</p><p>This show is incredible.  It is incredibly real and way too accurate that it's almost too much for me.  Freaks and Geeks fills me with so much sentiment, nostalgia, and memories of my own life in high school.  Good times, Bad times..  It's not like watching Back to the Future for the first time in 10 years and thinking back to the first time you saw this masterpiece..  It's living your life again..  too many social cares..  rejection..  affliation..  acceptance..  It's like watching a home movie of your life at age 14.</p><p>This slice of life is too big for me to handle..  It's really not a case of whether I like this show or not..  I feel like this show is me..  It's too good..  which is why it was cancelled. :/</p><p>I'll probably watch the rest of it tonight and tomorrow.</p><div class='title'><b>Judd Appatow</b></div><p>After Freaks and Geeks was cancelled, Judd Apatow (co-creator) went with a more comedic approach to the 'Freaks and Geeks' feel..  Undeclared was his next show, which featured 'Freaks and Geeks' in college.  Jocks became Frat boys..  Cheerleaders became Sorority girls..  but the social outcasts, where still outcasts.</p><p>It premiered on Fox, which probably doomed the show from the start.  It also only lasted one season.  I only remember seeing part of an episode, but I don't really remember it.  From what I remember, this is way more lighthearted than Freaks and Geeks.</p><p>Apparently, Judd Apatow has three other unaired television series that seem similar.  "Life on Parole", "North Hollywood", and "Sick in the Head".  Pilots were created for these three series, but they were very aired.</p><p>I guess the average TV viewer and Judd Apatow don't mix.  It's a damn shame though..  As far as popularity though, Apatow really struck it rich in the movies..  He hung with Will Ferril for a bit, and produced Anchorman, Kicking & Screaming (will ferril's crappy soccer movie), and Talladega Nights.</p><p>But his real talent lies in bringing slices of life into the theater..  He still comes back to the 'Freaks and Geeks' social groups, and made 3 movies in different points in time.  At the age 40 timeline, there's 40 year old virgin.  At the age 23-25 timeline, there's knocked up.  And at the age 18 timeline, there's Superbad.  You may not be the main characters in these movies, but chances are there's a character you relate to.</p><p>Another interesting fact is that Seth Rogen is in all 5 of Apatow's "slice of life" dramedies, and also several other actors and actresses as well.  Judd Apatow really doesn't give much direction when working with his talents, he produces these movies highlighting his talent's natural persona and let's them go loose.</p><div class='title'><b>Six Degrees of Separation</b></div><p>Besides Seth Rogen, Apatow reuses a lot of the talent that has been in his properties, and even the talent themselves have appeared in other films and TV together..  maybe its because when someone makes a geeky or burnout movie, these guys are the best candidates?  maybe its coincidence..?  fate..?  or perhaps they just like each ^_^.</p><p>I made <a href="/pages/apatow.html" title="/pages/apatow.html">a page</a> with all these social links.
