A cold and soft blanket of what the night would be.  After buying some delicious groceries, the blanket thickened as visability dimmed.</p><p>The previous snowfall had already begun to melt from the warmth of the past few days.  the beautiful white hills sported patches of unsightly brown.</p><p>After making dinner, my roommates gathered their things.  They were to house sit for the weekend.  A virtual mansion out in the countryside.  The animals needed feeding, so this was their task.  They asked me to join them, and hell...  I wasn't going to stay behind alone.</p><p>Outside was whitening.  A new cover of snow with plenty more falling from the sky.  Inside the car we puttered along the highway far slower than the limit.  An hour later, we reached our destination in the white wilderness.  Our tracks were covered behind us.  Its as if there was nothing out there.  Like we traveled  into the heart of white darkness with a warm lonely mansion at its center.  We piled out of the car, and sought refuge inside.  The car disappeared in snow as we moved to the doorsteps.</p><p>Inside we could only see white snow cover.</p><p>whoooo.  party!  thank god we brought about 100 beers with.  we played cards and built a fire and fell asleep.</p><p>The morning came and white light crept into the room bit by bit.  It had stopped snowing at some point through the night, but it is forcasted to add another equal layer.</p><p>so, we're here..  in the white wilderness, feeding their animals and listening to the radio.</p><p>I wonder who's gonna go crazy with the axe first.</p><p>anywho..  I wrote this on my phone.. :O<br/></p></div><p align="right"><font color="#666666" size="2">-- Dyre</font></p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table bgcolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:3px 0px 0px 0px;"><tr><td background="https://theschlock.com/img/old/v3/archive_grid2.jpg"></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#000000" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:3px 0px 0px 0px;"><tr><td align="center" background="https://theschlock.com/img/old/v3/archive_grid4.jpg"><table cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px;"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="left"><font color="#FF6600" size="2"><b><font color="#0066ff">January 10, 2007</font></b></font></p><div class="archive" id="postContent"><p>ahh... the joys of trying to get out of jury duty.</p><p>Way back in June last year, my parents got a little notice in the mail from the Court Administration of Hennepin County.  Out of everyone in the county and amongst many others, i was selected to serve Jury Duty.  Well, at the time i couldn't do such a thing since i was living in Madison and working 50 ish hours a week.  I couldn't really postpone it to the immediate future either because i was going off to Japan, which is also not near downtown Minneapolis.</p><p>I called up the jury office and said such things and they asked when i could serve jury duty within the next six months.  I said, "oh i dunno... how about the second week in January or something like that.."  and thus it was written.</p><p>I got back from Japan and putzed around for a while.  The Thursday before i was moving down to Madison to start my new job, my mom reminds me that i had Jury duty on Monday...  which i had completely forgot about.  I probably would've paid more attention to it, had i no plans to try and get out of it again.  So i'm all like, "whatever..  i'll call 'em up tomorrow and tell i can't go. wheee."</p><p>Tomorrow came; i had the day off.  I called them up later in the afternoon to continue my streak of lazy.  "i'm sorry," i say, "but i can't make it in on Monday..  i'm.. uh...  moving down to Madison this weekend and start my job Monday."  Though, this was a bit of a lie.  The monday of my jury duty was January 8th, and the monday of starting my job was January 15th.  "you can't come in on Monday..?  This is a little short notice.  I mean..  we'll need some kind of proof... and...  you haven't even sent in your questionnaire.  can you fax us something that proves you start on Monday?"  "uhhh...  no i can't do that because i don't have any of that with me..  and blah blah blah."  "well can you fax us something on Monday morning when you're at your job?"  "....k"</p><p>So...  now i was in a bit of a pickle.  Caught in a lie to the court, it would seem.  Well, first thing i did was go to their website and fill out that questionnaire.  And.. i planned on going downtown on Monday and saying something like, "oh crap... i got the weeks messed up.  i actually start next week 'n stuff. nurrr."</p><p>Bright and Early, Monday morning, i skipped out of Pharmacy work pretty early, and went downtown to get their at 9am.  I looked all over the letter and figured that 9am was when i was supposed to be there.  I got to the court building, went where i was supposed to and found nothing.  It was pretty empty.  All the doors were closed and looked like nothing was going on.  I walked around the building a little bit and asked information where to go.  They sent me right back to where i was.  There's a big sign that says, "Jury Administration" with an arrow pointing to the door.  I got closer and heard some voices inside.  The door was opened a crack, so i poked my head in and saw a large auditorium filled with about 200 people listening to a lecturer.<br/>"crap..  am i late, or something?" i thought.  I took a look at my letter a little more closely and saw that i was ACTUALLY supposed to get there at 8:15am.  "Well shit..  45 minutes late," i thought, "Screw this.. i'm taking off.  i told 'em i wasn't going to be here anyways."  I got back and emailed Bryan at my job about that proof of employment.</p><p>At this point i figured..  they have the fax about my employment, and i didn't show up, which i told them i wasn't.  eh, i should be fine.  No need to call them and have everything sorted out.  They can call me if they have any problems...  Though, i guess i'll need to get citizenship to Wisconsin to prove i live there.. sigh.</p><p>Well, on Wednesday i got a new piece of mail from the Court Administration of Hennepin County.  "This should be interesting..." i thought, "probably some letter bitching about my absence downtown."  As luck would have it, it was the exact opposite of that scenario.</p><p>The letter stated that after reviewing my questionnaire i had completed, Hennepin County would not need my services for Jury Duty.  So, i guess all that running around was really all for not.  huzzah.  now i don't need to get a Wisconsin Driver's license until i move somewhere less temporary.</p><p>My little brother told me something that day that he heard from some standup comedian.  "There's no way i'd ever commit some huge crime because it puts my life in the hands of 12 people not smart enough to get out of Jury duty."<br/></p></div><p align="right"><font color="#666666" size="2">-- Dyre</font></p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table bgcolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:3px 0px 0px 0px;"><tr><td background="https://theschlock.com/img/old/v3/archive_grid2.jpg"></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#000000" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:3px 0px 0px 0px;"><tr><td align="center" background="https://theschlock.com/img/old/v3/archive_grid4.jpg"><table cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px;"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="left"><font color="#FF6600" size="2"><b><font color="#0066ff">October 14, 2005</font></b></font></p><div class="archive" id="postContent"><p>Man, I have been out of it for quite a while.

Crosby, a book assigned to be read by this Thursday for World Civilization II. But unlike most other history books required for reading, the one is actually quite interesting as it discusses the biological effects of what America was to what it is today.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>When the Europeans landed in America in 1492, the bridge between the two sides of the globe was formed and what the Europeans saw in America completely shocked them. They had never before seen an iguana, an alligator, a rattlesnake, a monkey that swung from branches with its tail, nor bison and buffalo. Before this time, horses, cattle, chickens, pigs, donkeys and such were exclusive only to the old world.</p><p>The biggest domesticated quadaped in the new world was the dog. Since the new world had never seen horses, or anything else before, the Native Americans were shocked and frightened to see such beasts being ridden by man. And when the settlers finally did attack and masacare the Native Americans, such fear felt by the Native Americans would be the same as if the planet Earth were attacked by an alien race of superior technology. It's as if our America as we live in today, is the result of an alien invasion over 500 years ago that completely raped and wiped out the previous life, settled, and grew with no regard for the previous inhabitants.</p><p>The book gives an example of Orson Well's War of the Worlds as being a close similarity to the fights. The settlers had superior defenses and offenses, superior weaponry, and the settlers also brought with them highly infectious viruses they already knew about, but the native Americans had never seen before in their lives. I think we know how that went.</p><p>Back when the settlers returned to America, they brought with them horses, cattle, swine, and so forth. The land was so vast and "untouched" that it was perfect for these animals, who in America had no real predator, to roam free and multiply at unheard numbers. Some ranches that lost 30-40 of their cattle, would later find the cattle in pastures had multiplied to about 400 in only a matter of a few decades.</p><p>Passing by ships through the tropic islands between North and South America would simply drop off a few dozens pigs on some of the islands, then return in a few decade to their heards' exponential growth. Who knows how much plantlife had gone extinct at this time, when these animals devoured every plant that was edible.</p><p>So many of the animals brought over to the Americas escaped free to nature. Cats and goats, as well. Later on in the 19th century, Charles Darwin toured the Americas and saw that the more docile and domesticated species in Europe were now furociously transformed and deadly to survive and live on their own for the past 300 years in the Americas. How the sweet cute cat when found later in the mountains of South America had grown in overall size, bore greater fangs, and hunted its prey more stealthlike. How the very docile goat in the mountains grew larger horns, and attacked trespassers.</p><p>This brought about more discussion of evolution and survival, ontop of the already conversial and debated theories of where all the species of Native America could have come from. Like, if Noah had 2 of every animal on his ark, which was in Jeruselum, how did all these unheard of species exist on the other side of the world, if they had no way to get there, and God flooded the entire earth? Many debates were constructed about the bering land bridge, or that the flood didn't flood as far as America.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Anyways, I'm over halfway through the book, but the author retells the details over and over again. The repetition is a little annoying, but it helps for memorization and emphasis.<br/></p></div><p align="right"><font color="#666666" size="2">-- Dyre</font></p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table bgcolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:3px 0px 0px 0px;"><tr><td background="https://theschlock.com/img/old/v3/archive_grid2.jpg"></td></tr></table><table cellpadding="10" bgcolor="#000000" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:3px 0px 0px 0px;"><tr><td align="center" background="https://theschlock.com/img/old/v3/archive_grid4.jpg"><table cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" border="0" width="100%" style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px;"><tr><td valign="top" align="center" bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align="left"><font color="#FF6600" size="2"><b><font color="#0066ff">August 17, 2003</font></b></font></p><div class="archive" id="postContent"><p>This is going to sound like every single first post of any blog i've ever written, but...
