All of the modern updates were included and felt amazing.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/tetris.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/tetris.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/tetris.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p><I>Update 2023</I>: These days, I think Tetris DS has been outshined by the indie release of Apotris for the Gameboy Advance. Extremely tight controls and includes Zoning and Perfectrises adding from Tetris Effect. Unfortunately, it's been DMCA'd by the Tetris Company, so you can no longer buy it.</p><div class='title'><b>3. Dance Dance Revolution (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>DDR is a game series that has now been lost to time. The rhythm game genre and arcade have moved on from the simple steps. But it will always hold a significant place in my heart.</p><p>DDR taught me the importance of exercise and how it's really not all that difficult to lose weight as long as you work at it each day. By playing DDR in college, at gaming events, random arcades, and other places both in American and Japan, I had met a lot of people and made friends. Some of whom I'm still friends with after a long time.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/ddr.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/ddr.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/ddr.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Many of the songs in the game were uplifting, and the button presses matches the movements you would do if you were just grooving to the tunes. It was fun to feel like you've become part of the music, and building a community around those songs and a physical space were some of the best parts of my college experience. </p><p>Those days are behind me now, but I always use music when doing exercise these days, and the movements and power I get from the music always pushes me further.</p><p>These are the best home releases of Dance Dance Revolution:</p><p>Playstation 2: DDR Max (USA), DDR Max 2 (Japan), DDR Party Collection, DDR Extreme (USA)<br/>Playstation 1: DDR 5th Mix (Japan), DDR 3rd Mix (Japan)</p><div class='title'><b>2. Pokemon (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>Pokemon is my brand. Almost all of the games on this list have consumed my life at certain points of time, but no series is ever present in my head than Pokemon. Pokemon is always evolving and always has something new going on for better or worse.</p><p>I first played Pokemon Blue back in the day, and came back to the series later with Pokemon Emerald and Fire Red. Since then, I've bought and played each main game release ever building to my goal of completing the Pokedex. I finally completed this goal in 2016 with Generation 6.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/pokemon.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/pokemon.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/pokemon.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Also, in 2016, Pokemon Go was released for phones. It was fun at the time, but got boring. In 2018 I came back, and became something that I use on a daily basis. I love exploration in games, and Pokemon Go had me exploring my town in real life, driving to physical waypoints to meet up with other people and play together. I've met tons of people around town and at events as well as made plenty of online friends, too.</p><p>As the pandemic had many people locked down in the homes, I began streaming Pokemon on Twitch with Let's Go Eevee. A lot of students and young folk began watching me try to collect all of the shiny variants in the game. It became an incredible social experience that brought me back into programming and building an online community.</p><p>Much like DDR, it's fair to say that Pokemon has changed my life, and it often inspires me to do creative works around it.</p><p>I did two inner lists for Pokemon. First, was a ranking of each Generation of Pokemon. Even though I started with Kanto, I think Hoenn was what really got me back into Pokemon.</p><p>Gen 3 > 5 > 1 > 9 > 6 >> 4 > 8 > 7 > 2</p><p>I also did a tier list for each of the individual Pokemon games. <I>Update 2023</I>: I added all the games recently released to these lists.</p><p>S Tier : Emerald / HeartGold SoulSilver / Black White / OmegaRuby AlphaSapphire / Legends<br/>A+ Tier: New Snap / FireRed LeafGreen / Platnium / Let's Go Pikachu Eevee<br/>A Tier : Go / Conquest / Black White 2  / Scarlet Violet<br/>B+ Tier: Snap / Red Blue / Diamond Pearl / Sun Moon<br/>B Tier : Gold Silver Crystal / Ruby Sapphire / Ultra Sun Moon / Sword Shield<br/>C Tier : Yellow / XY<br/>F Tier : BrilliantDiamond ShiningPearl<br/>— others</p><div class='title'><b>1. Snatcher</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>Snatcher has been at the top of my list of favorite games forever. I think some other games have changed my life more and hold more meaning, but Snatcher will always have a place in my heart.</p><p>Going from Mario, Zelda, and even Final Fantasy, the characters of Snatcher felt real, had distinct motivations, thoughts, and feelings opened my eyes to the potential of storytelling through games. As the overall mystery is uncovered, characters change and motivations make sense. It was the first game I played where death actually had meaning.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Snatcher uses both Blade Runner and Terminator to create a unique story of killer robots, Snatchers, killing and impersonating people. You play as Gillian Seed who had lost his memory and joined the Junkers, a police division which specializes in hunting down the Snatchers. Ultimately, the plot is uncovered and Gillian Seed gets more answers to his past. </p><p>Snatcher was Hideo Kojima’s second game as a sole director. The Sega CD version was the one I played back in the day. It was released in 1994 and was the 4th iteration having prior been released on PC-8801 (1988), MSX (1988), and Turbo CD (1992). This was the only American release, and it was complete with English voice acting and cutscenes. </p><p>The music is very futuristic 90s synthwave that matches the grimey, dirty, and metallic feeling of Neo Kobe City. As the story builds, the music builds with it. It was one of the first games I played where the music set a tense mood and atmosphere rather than just being background music. Snatcher’s sound and music was written and arranged by Akira Yamaoka. This was one of his first games, too. Later on, he would curate and write music for DDR, and ultimately move on to create the Silent Hill series.</p><p>I will always love Snatcher, and I don’t think I’ll ever knock it off my No. 1 position as my favorite game of all time.</p><div class='title'><b>My Favorite Games</b></div><p>As you can see from my list, my favorite games tend to be the ones that allow exploration of a massive world, have a compelling story with unique and distinct characters, and have a unique and memorable soundtrack that accurately compliments the setting, the gameplay, or the story. I tend to value those aspects over the actual gameplay.</p><p>It’s interesting to see how my favorites list has changed over the last few decades. You can view my list from 2007 below. Over time, I can’t really see this list changing much more. I think the top entries are pretty much set.<br/></p></div><p align="right"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px;" bgcolor="#000000" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td class="reviews"><span style="font-size: 8px;"> </span></td></tr></table></td><td style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px;" valign="top" align="center" width="200"><table bgcolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" border="0" width="200"><tr><td background="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/v4/reviews_1.jpg" height="468"> </td></tr><tr><td background="https://theschlock.com/assets/old/v4/reviews_2.jpg" valign="middle" align="center" height="32"><font class="men">One Schlock's Requiem</font></td></tr></table><table style="margin:5px 0px 5px 0px;" bgcolor="#000000" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td class="reviews"><table bgcolor="#000000" cellpadding="5" border="0" width="100%"><tr><td bgcolor="#333333"><p><font class="mens">The On-going this and that</font><br/><a onmouseout="window.status='';" onMouseOver="window.status='what happend yesterday, perhaps..'; return true;" href="/old/v4"><font color="#ffffff" class="menx">past updates</font></a></p><p class="x"><font class="men">Works</font><br/><a onmouseout="window.status='';" onMouseOver="window.status='Art created for Literary purposes'; return true;"><font color="#ffffff" class="menx">Literary</font></a><br/><a onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" onMouseOver="window.status='Art created for Visual purposes'; return true;"><font color="#ffffff" class="menx">Visual</font></a><br/><a onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" onMouseOver="window.status='Art created for Story purposes'; return true;"><font color="#ffffff" class="menx">Comic Panels</font></a></p><p class="x"><font class="men">Photography</font><br/><a onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" onMouseOver="window.status='Photography of the world around you'; return true;" href="/old/v4/photo"><font color="#ffffff" class="menx">Imagery</font></a><br/><a onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" onMouseOver="window.status='Photography of the world underneath you'; return true;" href="/old/v4/club"><font color="#ffffff" class="menx">After Hours</font></a></p><p class="x"><a onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" onMouseOver="window.status='My comments of the media of others'; return true;" href="/old/v4/reviews"><font color="#ffffff" class="men">Impressions</font></a></p><p class="x"><a onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" onMouseOver="window.status='Those who contribute to The Schlock'; return true;" href="/old/v4/aboutme"><font color="#ffffff" class="men">Profile</font></a></p><p class="x"><a onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" onMouseOver="window.status='Locate where you wish to visit'; return true;"><font color="#ffffff" class="men">Site Map</font></a></p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><p><font style="color: #ffffff;" class="txt">© 2000 - 2003 .
