Episode 10 will air on Monday December 10th, followed by Episode 11 on the following Monday.  Episode 12 is placed on Wednesday December 19th at 10/9c.  Not too shabby.  (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34919">aint it cool</a>)</p><p>As that article suggested, the decision to air episode 12 came from the caring, passionate support of internet fans, namely those at <a href="http://savejourneyman.net/" title="http://savejourneyman.net/">SaveJourneyman.net</a>.  Those involved with the site are trying to organize a "Save our Show" campaign similar to what happened with Jericho.</p><p>Earlier this year <a href="http://nutsonline.com/" title="http://nutsonline.com/">Nuts Online .com</a> instituted a campaign called "Nuts for Jericho" where fans contributed money towards a daily shipment of peanuts to CBS New York.  A grand total of $56,968 was spent, totaling over 8 million peanuts.  Check it out: <a href="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho" title="http://www.nutsonline.com/jericho">Nuts for Jericho</a>.</p><p>And it worked!  CBS signed Jericho for a 2nd season.</p><p>It doesn't really look like SaveJourneyman.net is as organized as Nuts for Jericho, but there's plenty of time.. thanks to the strike.  Even though Life and Chuck were renewed, they still need to make those episodes..  If the strike is resolved within this next month, I wonder if they'll try to complete seasons by May..</p><p>hmm... I should probably netflix Jericho to see what all the fuss is about.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 28, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 26, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">NBC Monday Night updates</h3><p>Heroes is really coming down to the wire.  After last week's phenomenal episode, the story continues to build to the fall season finale.  This story arc ends next week, and with that we probably won't see any new episodes of Heroes for a while, due to strike.  With the strike..  episode 11 of Heroes Season 2 is somewhat posed to be the overall season finale. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34889">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>Recanting <a href="/old/v6/heroes-and-journeyman" title="/heroes-and-journeyman">last week's post</a>, "Journeyman will be canceled unless the two-parter (episodes 8 and 9) .. brings big numbers."  I watched both episodes and they were quite good.  I'm almost sad to see the show go.  The plot of Journeyman is really coming together, and the fall finale (two-parter of episodes 11 and 12) bring the plot full circle as it is finally told why Dan is traveling through time.</p><p>Journeyman has 3 episodes left, but won't be airing next week.  Next week, after Heroes, that new cop-drama, Life, will air the beginning of a two-parter to end on its normal timeslot on Wednesday.  The week after is Journeyman's "Christmas episode".  The next Monday after that on December 17th, will be the first episode of the finale, episode 11.  Unfortunately, it seems that episode 12 may not even air according to <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34883">Aint it Cool</a>.</p><p>After watching this past week, I'm really quite excited to see what happens, but with the numbers in the toilet, it doesn't seem like Journeyman will even gets its end aired.  But, for those fans out there, Journeyman will be released on DVD will its high-budgeted music soundtrack intact, and including all episodes. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34900">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>At this time, NBC has ordered more episodes of Life and that crappy show Chuck, through the rest of their debut seasons...  but Journeyman is still on the chopping block. (source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34898">aint it cool</a>).</p><p>I'd probably like Journeyman more if the episodes followed a stricter plot.  The episodes have been very episodic, giving bits and pieces of the overall plot in each episode.  I'd much rather be absorbed in the story the whole time, like in Heroes and Lost, then you can see everything in the show develop at once.. characters evolve..  plot is continuous.  You never feel like you're wasting your time watching an episode.</p><p>Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>In other news.... Strike</b></div><p>Some of the commercials tonight for new programming beginning in January really makes me feel like the Strike is taking its toll on programming.  Especially with a trailer for the return of <b>American Gladiators</b> to prime-time television, beginning January 7th-ish.  ugh...  I'll probably still watch the premiere episode, though..</p><p>Some good news, though..  Yet another <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34897">Aint it Cool</a> article states that the strike could be resolved before Christmas.

Since my little brother had to go back up North for school, I figured this was the perfect time to dump the car at home since they needed it.  I really didn't want it anymore since it starting acting up a couple weeks ago and it's old and I don't really want it anymore.</p><p>Despite having engine troubles, I figured it could make the 300 mile journey without a problem..  well, I was wrong about that one.  20 miles north of Wis. Dells, my front tire exploded!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0924.webp" /></p><p>I've never seen a tire crap out this bad.  My little brother was behind me and said the hub cap popped square off the car and traveled parallel for a little while until it hit the ground and flew off into the ditch.</p><p>Luckily the Oldsmobile is such a boat, it never came close to flipping or skidding or anything..  I just pulled over and took pictures!  We put the spare tire on the car and traveled about 230 miles back home.</p><p>Before we left, I refueled both cars at the exact same time and reset the mileage.  What's really interesting is that the Oldsmobile registered the trip as 330 miles, whereas my new-ish car traveled a mere 305 miles.  I thought the spare looked smaller than the other tires.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071124_tire/100_0931.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, goodbye Oldsmobile, hello new car ^_^.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 24, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 22, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Mass Effect Impressions</h3><p>Yesterday, when arriving home from work, a package from Gamestop lie at my doorstep and inside was my #1 anticipated game of this Christmas season.. <b>Mass Effect</b>.  I purchased the limited edition version, which is only available online.</p><p>I probably should've bought it from amazon, rather than the price gouging money grubbing monolith Gamestop, but I'm actually satisfied that they got me the game before the thanksgiving day weekend.  I was scheduled to get the game on Monday, but it's here today ^_^.  I can't complain about that.</p><div class='title'><b>Goodies</b></div><p>Anywho.. here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0916.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0917.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071121_masseffect/100_0920.webp" /></p><p>Lots and lots of Mass Effect goodness.  I got the pre-order bonus with it as well, so overall I have 1) the game, 2) 2 bonus discs with extra content, 3) an art book with pretty concept art (unlike the crappy halo 3 artbook), 4) a log book with background and information on the worlds and aliens of Mass Effect, and 5) a crappy tin box to hold everything in.  This crappy tin is far better than the Halo 3, so it's not all bad.  I'm still keeping my game in the pre-order box for easy access, though.</p><div class='title'><b>Character creation</b></div><p>When beginning Mass Effect, you have the choice of playing John Shepard, or creating your own character.  I created a custom male character and began playing the game, but I could not continue.  My dude looked like a chump..  How am I supposed to care about some guy I'd run into at a bar?  I scrapped that game and began anew with a female lead..</p><p>The character is much more solid compared to Oblivion.  The controls and customization are so loose in Oblivion, you really have to work on a character to not be Ugly.  Even the random generated characters look like crap.  Not so with Mass Effect..  You really have to work on a character to make them Ugly.</p><p>The characters look really nice, but all the guys look rather plain.  I would rather play as John Shepard, than a custom male character.  The female custom characters are pretty hot though..  The character I ended up creating looks like a young badass Captain Janeway.</p><p>Before you mess with looks, you have to choose your character's past.  You have 3 choices for childhood, and 3 choices from military past.  For childhood you can be an Earther, living on the streets, running tricks, and joining the military as a last resort (much like Captain Tylor), a Colonist, whose home was destroyed by an invading alien race (kinda like the dude in Nadesico), or Military, both parents alive and raised you while serving (kinda like every macross character).</p><p>Your 3 choices from military past are Sole Survivor, where you were the sole survivor of a failed mission, War Hero, where you have battled and lead your team victoriously, or Ruthless, where you'll win a battle at any cost.</p><p>You also choose your ailments, where it be all out gunplay, techplay or magic, or a combination of two.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>When you're out on a mission, you are shooting up evil aliens in Gears of War / Rainbox Six style.  Third person shooting and killing while commanding your team to do certain things.. like heal or attack.  Much like KOTOR, you have a party of 3.</p><p>It's pretty fun so far, but I REALLY miss the melee attack from Halo 3.  The melee attack really is the last line of defense between you and your enemy and being forced to shoot an enemy at point blank range seems unnatural now.</p><p>Oh well, I'm not supposed to let enemies that close anyways..</p><p>blah blah .. what else can I really say about the gameplay.  It's a third person shooter.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Anyways, so far, after 1 hour, the game is pretty amazing.  It's already building up its massive political story, so it should be a great time sinker.  Check it out.</p><p>Mario is also a great time sinker, but in a much different way.

It may be the beginning of the work week, but who cares.  Its Heroes night.  Tonight's Heroes is chapter 9 of the 11 chapter fall season.

I woke up early for a Sunday, curled up in a blanket and plopped myself on the couch for the better part of the day playing Super Mario Galaxy.  Sunlight peering through the blinds, everyone else asleep..  Just me, the whole rest of the day, and my game.  Quite relaxing..  and despite not getting anything remotely constructive done, it was so worth it.</p><div class='title'><b>Music</b></div><p>The music in Mario Galaxy is rather peculiar.  The game makes all attempts to be modernized and cutting edge and the music pushes what you would normally hear in a video game.  Many of the main level themes are purely orchestral and very uplifting..  The type of thing you would hear in a major film release or ballad.</p><p>These themes are majestic and inspiring...  When I enter a world that begins like this, it makes me feel like I'm playing a masterpiece..  I feel like I am the center of attention.  The music puts you on such a pedestal, that all my worldly cares disappear, and I am in the game..</p><p>Contrary to this, Mario Galaxy also features a fair amount of remixed tracks from the Nintendo and Super Nintendo Mario games..  These are mainly used in more technical and retro style levels or portions of the level.  The parts of the game that make you feel like you're playing a video game, rather than exploring the world.</p><p>Overall, though, the music is exceptional.</p><div class='title'><b>Length</b></div><p>Mario Galaxy is around the perfect length.  Currently, I have about 80 stars and 14 hours.  60 stars are required to finish the game, and I could've done that hours ago.  But, through taking my time and enjoying myself, 14 hours is probably the average time it would take.</p><p>Replay has always been great for Mario games.  The amount of hidden stars, hidden levels, and hidden other stuff makes the game twice as long.  As with previous Mario games, you need 60 stars to beat the game out of 120 stars total.</p><div class='title'><b>Star layout</b></div><p>I'm finding it extremely easy to find all the hidden stuff.  Overall, there are 15 actual levels that contain 6 stars each.  Each level lays out 3 stars for you.  Another star is hidden in one of these 3 layouts.  Beyond that you have 2 comet stars.  1 is a purple coin star, where you must collect 100 purple in the level, and the other is a 'status' effect on the world.</p><p>This status effect will be one of four different types.  Either a speed run, a race against a ghost time, or fighting a boss without getting hurt.  The game said there were 4 types, but I haven't run into any ones other than these.</p><p>After getting 10 or 15 stars, the 'status' comets will begin to appear, and after you beat the game the purple coin comets begin to appear.</p><p>The main levels of the game only account for a total of 90 stars.  Through the observatory, you'll find other one-shot levels with stars in them.  These are usually really technical platforming puzzles, or some other weird gameplay mechanic.  Large boss fights are also one-shots, which usually involve fighting Bowser or Bowser Jr.</p><p>Also, hidden throughout the game, are 3 green stars which will open up a few more one-shot worlds.  There's also a hidden red star, which will unlock Mario's flight powerup in certain levels.</p><div class='title'><b>Hidden is not so hidden</b></div><p>From the layout of the game, finding the "hidden" stuff, really isn't that difficult at all.  The game basically hands you 5 out of 6 stars on a plate and the game sometimes hints to you where the "hidden" star is in the world too.  At some point, you rescue Luigi and he goes into worlds and finds 3 of the hidden stars for you.</p><p>You still need to find the hidden star on your own, but it's really not all that difficult with the linear layout of most levels.  Just keep your eyes peeled and always take the path less traveled.  Eventually the star or the method to get the star will come clear.</p><p>I don't see the next 40 stars I need to complete the game being much trouble at all.  I haven't even gone to 5 whole worlds yet..  that's 30 stars right there.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>I would say Mario Galaxy is all that difficult..  nor would I say its too easy.  I die quite a bit in the game, but it doesn't really keep me from beating levels and killing bosses.  I usually die because I fail a challenge that the game presents me.. or I screw something up.  The game really gives you a chance to grow against the challenge rather than he hindered by it or bored by it.</p><p>I'm never really overwhelmed or underwhelmed with trying to play the game.  Of course, I'm only 66% through the full game at the moment..  The real challenges lie at the end of the game and I can't wait to try them out.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, i think Mario Galaxy is excellent.  Honestly, I don't think you could make a game that could describe excellence in video gaming better than this.  Mario Galaxy works on so many levels, and is the perfect game to reach all demographics, ages, and genders.</p><p>But..</p><p>Mario does not move me.  When I play Mario Galaxy, I feel like I, the player, am center stage..  Not Mario.  Mario is just a character, running around worlds collecting stars to save the princess.  There is no emotional attachment to anything in the game.  It's all about playing the game..  Therefore I feel like my money would be better spent on something else..</p><p>:shrugs: i dunno...</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 18, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 14, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Super Mario Galaxy Impressions</h3><p>After calling several times yesterday and today, Toys R Us finally got their copy of Super Mario Galaxy, so I went there right after work to pick up my copy.  As mentioned <a href="/old/v6/super-mario-galaxy-hype" title="/super-mario-galaxy-hype">previously</a>, I choose Toys R Us as my pre-order location because they offered a $25 gift card with purchase.  To my happy surprise, not only did they offer the $25, but they also had the official pre-order bonus too!</p><p>Booya!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/mario.webp" /></p><p>The official pre-order bonus is a commemorative coin in a DVD sized package.  The coin isn't all that cheap either.  It feels like pewter, or something..  It has a lot of weight and mass to it though, so it's not going to fall apart.  The yellow colored in star is kind cheap though..</p><div class='title'><b>Game setup</b></div><p>I made sure Tony was home before putting the game into the Wii and beginning my journey into the star kingdom.  Before playing the game, I was instructed to update my Wii to the current firmware, which is rather interesting.</p><p>The Wii had an firmware update the other day, but I was unable to update my Wii because of networking issues.  Still unable to reach the internet, my Wii was able to update using the Super Mario Galaxy disc instead.  Is this the first Wii title to force you to upgrade to the current firmware?</p><p>This is quite similar to PSP games, which contain the most recent version of the firmware you need in order to play the game.</p><div class='title'><b>The Game</b></div><p>Anyways, after upgrading and restarting, I was in.  The game begins with a fair amount of cutscenes and a hint of story.  Quite similar to Mario Sunshine, where the first 20 minutes is moving and viewing through the introduction of the game.  Once the story is set, and the rules are laid out off you go into the game.</p><p>The game laid out exactly the same as Mario 64 and Mario sunshine.  In Mario 64, you move around the castle to find levels.  In Mario Sunshine, you move around the island to find levels.  In Mario Galaxy, you move around the floaty space thingy to find levels.  On this space station are observatories you can access other galaxies which contain the stars you need to collect.</p><p>So far, the space station feels very limited compared to the Mario 64 Castle or the Mario Sunshine Island.  In the previous 2 games, there were many nooks and crannies to find hidden items, levels and stars..  but, I'm really not that far at all.  As you collect more stars in Galaxy, more parts of the space station are available.</p><p>Another thing that really bothers me about Galaxy thus far are the level layouts.  So far, each level has been incredibly linear.  You move from one floating part of the level to the next with no in-betwen.  You don't have that absolute freedom you had with Mario 64 or Mario Sunshine.  With those games you could go anywhere in the level.  With Galaxy, you can only move to places that have a warp.  It puts a damper on the whole 3D Mario theme.</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>Before touching this game, I was quite concerned with how a 3D platformer would operate with the Wii-mote.  Especially the lack of a right-analog stick which has really become the standard for operating the camera.  Also, platformers are designed for a traditional controller.  You don't need fancy motion controls when you're simply trying to move about the stage.</p><p>Besides that, the two-handed controller provides the extra amount of stability to keep the joystick steady and stationary.  A one-handed joystick without any stability makes it very difficult to move precisely where you want to.</p><p>So far, my fears have been somewhat realized.  The lack of camera controls is annoying as hell, but the floaty camera isn't too bad.  It will face in the direction you want to look at nearly all the time, and will correct itself fast enough that it doesn't piss you off.  They do provide a first-person camera view too, if you want to look around the level.</p><div class='title'><b>Annoying controls</b></div><p>Movement has been hit or miss with me.  Jumping is the number one thing you must nail down for the platforming genre.  If you can't jump and land with precision than the gameplay gets in the way of what you want to do.  You begin fighting with the game more than the challenges it presents.</p><p>When presented with Jumping puzzles in Mario Galaxy, I feel like I'm fighting with the controls about half of the time.  This is combination of problems with the camera angle and joystick angle.</p><p>In Mario Galaxy, you are moving around clusters of objects in 3D space, most of which are spherical.  Running down the side of a sphere in space won't move the camera, it'll keep itself centered on you as you begin to run around upside down.  Jumping onto enemies is a pain in the ass, when the camera doesn't give you an angle to correctly view the action.  I, generally, have to guess where the enemy will be and hope I land there.</p><p>One-handed movement is what I really dread about this game.  With a two-handed controller, it's pretty easy to know which direction is precisely left or precisely right.  With the one-handed nun-chuck, you don't have the stability and relative position of your other hand to tell your brain which way angle left is precisely 90 degrees to the left.  It's relative to the position of the C-button underneath your fore-finger.</p><p>meh...  maybe I'm just being to cynical.</p><div class='title'><b>That warm feeling</b></div><p>Despite those annoyances, it's still retains that beautiful awe feeling of a true Nintendo developed game.  Starting my game on a Tuesday night in the middle of a busy work week doesn't give Mario Galaxy justice.</p><p>After playing for 2 hours, I wish I had begun playing on a holiday, like Thanksgiving or Christmas.  A day where you have no responsibilities..  All you have is a full day and Mario in your Wii.  I could play this game for hours upon hours.</p><p>That last game that made me feel this way was Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.  I began playing that game on New Years day around 8 or 9 in the morning, and I didn't put the controller down until 10pm.</p><p>It's that cheery Christmas feeling of having a beautiful, fun and massive game and all the time in the world to play it. ^_^</p><p>That's the feeling I get when playing Mario Galaxy..  Unfortunately, my weeknights are short, so I only made it through the first collection of levels at the 2 hour mark.</p><div class='title'><b>My Advice</b></div><p>If you have a Wii, definitely pick up Mario Galaxy, but don't start playing it just yet..  Through the next week, find a copy and hold on to it.  Refrain from cracking the seal until Thanksgiving Day, or the day after Thanksgiving.  Give yourself the entire day to play Mario Galaxy, because once you begin playing, you won't want to stop.</p><p>Crawl out of bed that morning in your pajamas.  Drag a blanket into the living room and just veg out all day.  Relive your days as a spunky youngster with the days off from school and no responsibilities, and play that game from dawn to dusk ^_^</p><p>That's probably what I'll be doing this coming Sunday..  unless my roommate sequesters the TV for football :/</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 14, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 13, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Xbox 360 - Bullet Witch</h3><p>On a lazy Sunday afternoon, I picked a game a 360 game that I figured would be pure gold.  I remember seeing ads all over Japan last fall for Bullet Witch and I wrote it off immediately as another piece of crap Japanese action game trying to pull the Japanese in the Xbox space.</p><p>It has everything the Japanese could ask for..  1) Hot female lead character wearing scantly clad outfits, and 2) putting that character in a position of kicking ass.  The sad solemn facade of main character, Alicia draws Japanese men to the flame.  She wears all black Gothic clothes.  She is unconcerning, cool, and never smiles..  wouldn't you like to be the one to melt her heart?</p><p>The title, Bullet Witch, can easily be explained by how you kill enemies..  either with your massive gun, or using magical spells.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story</b></div><p>When you play a Japanese FPS game, you definitely aren't playing it for the gameplay..  You either play it because you like the characters and/or you like the story.</p><p>Bullet Witch takes place in the year 2013, well after most of the world's population has been killed, diseased or exterminated.  Beginning in 2004, nations began to war with each other eventually leading to nuclear and biological attacks..  50% of the world's population had died by 2010 when a devastating virus ravages another billion.  In 2012-ish, a new foe emerges on earth..  hordes of demons crawl out from the ground and begin tearing apart the human race.</p><p>The year is now 2013, and a woman in black has been seen saving humans and killing demons.</p><p>The game starts at this point..  You are given a fair amount of the world's background, but nothing is said about the character you play.  Alicia appears at a point and you begin killing zombie demons.  You have a demonic voice in your head too, but that's never explained.</p><p>As you continue to fight into the city, you meet with a group of humans resisting the demons.  Leading this group is commander Michaels, who bears a striking resemblance to Bill Raiser of Neo Contra (and other contra games) fame.</p><div class='title'><b>Level Design</b></div><p>This basic gameplay and plot devices have you running around levels and killing demons in a very arcade manor.  Hordes of enemies come running and shooting after you, and you take that down with your guns and magics.</p><p>Each stage is basically a massive arena that is split up into a linear maze thanks to Walnut Heads.    Walnut heads create a force field preventing you from advancing into further areas of your level.  They are enemies that float 20-30 feet in the air using their massive car-sized brains.  The term walnut head is coined because the brain looks like a walnut.  To kill these assholes, just fire away at them and eventually they explode into a cloud a blood and guts.</p><p>Walnut heads may seem rather weak, but there are some that use their massive brain powers to pick up cars, buses and trucks to protect themselves and attack by hurling them at you.  Directly getting hit by a flying car of fire will result in your instant death, so be careful.</p><p>Once you unravel the maze and make it to the end, sometimes you'll fight a boss.  In fact, I think they are only 2 actual boss fights in the game, out of the 6 levels.</p><div class='title'><b>B-movie-tastic!</b></div><p>What I love most about Bullet Witch is the derivative story, corny dialogue, weird enemies and ridiculous boss fights.</p><p>The giant brain floating guys are pretty wicked and seeing them erupt into splash of blood and guts is neat, but my favorite enemy are the Screamers.  Screamers look like a big pile of flesh with 5 or 6 tiny legs popping out of bottom and wearing a wig.  These fellas send out grunge spirits which will possess nearby humans and turn their bodies into ravenous, large headed freaks who quickly scurry  along the ground at you.</p><p>They first appear in the airport level where you hijack a plane in an attempt to fly to the source of evil in the country.  They aren't too difficult to kill, but if you don't kill them fast enough, all of the civilians and your army crew will be turned into bone sucking demons you can't get away from.</p><p>The airport level was really the climax of the game for me.  After killing all the walnut heads, boarding the 747, and taking off into the moonlit sky..  you are under attack!  A massive flying demon beast with a body made of eyeballs pops out from the cloud cover and is heading straight for your plane.</p><p>Alicia saves the day, but kicking open the outer hatch and climbing on to the top of the 747 at 10,000 feet in the air.  Shooting the massive beast does no damage.  The eyeballs from its body pull out of their sockets and fly through the air onto your craft.  The eyes latch onto the plane and begin eating away at its surface.</p><p>You must use your devastating lightning attack against the huge beast, while dodging and shooting off the eye balls tearing your plane apart.</p><div class='title'><b>So close..</b></div><p>This seriously rivals the cheesiness of Neo Contra, while trying to keep things in the realm of reality.  I think that's what really holds this game back, aside from its technical flaws: pisspoor gameplay, not enough enemy variety, and shotty graphics.</p><p>When fighting on the plane, I was truly enjoying myself, but I never reclaimed that joy after the plane crashed landed and I was in the jungle for nearly the rest of the game.  The final level was the exact same as the second level in the city.</p><p>In chapter 3, up on the plane, you have your massive get-a-way from the evils in civilization, but out in the woods closing in on the source, you lose that attachment to society.  You lose that post-apocolyptic thought that society is screwed... and there's no perversion of earth to show you are diving into the belly of the beast.</p><div class='title'><b>Lineage</b></div><p>While playing Bullet Witch it feels a lot like some other games I've played.  Neo Contra definitely comes to mind, also it kinda reminds me of Nightmare Creatures for Playstation.  The enemies also remind me of Doom and Quake, but there were some other bits and pieces that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  After looking up the development team, and their past works it makes a lot of sense.</p><p>Before 2005, Cavia (developer of Bullet Witch) was a freelance game development company.  They made games for a variety of publishers, mostly anime licensed crap, but another game that has touched my heart..  Drag-on Dragoon, known in the states as Drakengard.</p><p>Read my impressions of Drag-on Dragoon from the past: <a href="/old/v6/drakengard-impressions" title="/drakengard-impressions">May 22nd, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v6/drakengard-impressions-2" title="/drakengard-impressions-2">May 27th, 2004</a>, <a href="/old/v6/drakengard-impressions-3" title="/drakengard-impressions-3">June 1st, 2004</a>, and <a href="/old/v6/drakengard-impressions-4" title="/drakengard-impressions-4">June 6th, 2004</a>.  ah, good times.  I played this game quite a bit in Platteville when I was moving out of the SPAMM haus and into 45 Bonson st.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bullet Witch doesn't reach the level of craziness Drag-on Dragoon pushed games, but it still holds some of the lineage... especially with the Screamers.</p><p>Man, that reminds me.. I still need to play Drag-on Dragoon 2..  That game is sitting in my PS2 TODO pile.</p><div class='title'><b>Content Selection: Restricted Downloadable Content</b></div><p>There's one other thing I wish to mention, and that is something I haven't seen in any other Xbox 360 game: the notion of restricted downloadable content.  Once you beat Bullet Witch, you are given a new menu option labeled Content Selection, in this menu you can download bite-size arcade levels for 25 cents each, or download new costumes for Alicia at the price of free.</p><p>You can't reach this downloadable content any other way than through this menu in the game.  You cannot go to the Xbox live marketplace to download this stuff, and you can't queue these downloads either.</p><p>Once in this menu, you click to download something and it'll pop up your xbox download hub and keep you there until whatever you are downloading is finished.  If you leave this menu, the download is instantly canceled.</p><p>There's even a little lock on the content manager when you select to download something.  Weird, huh?  I've never heard of any Xbox game do this before.</p><p>I downloaded all the costumes because why the hell not, but I may go back and pick up some of the arcade levels.  If anything, it's a good way to get rid of an extra 20 microsoft points here and there.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall Thoughts</b></div><p>Despite my praise in several segments of the game, and actually liking it quite a bit, the fact remains that this game is quite poor.  I've known an FPS to be this inaccurate and full of stupid gameplay devices try to pull it away from the FPS genre.  It's an FPS trying to be something different, and that doesn't work at all.  It's probably better to label this as an adventure game, but that's not right either.</p><p>Aside from Alicia and Bill Raiser, the graphics are sub-par.  It looks like it was originally a PS2 game, but they redid a few of the prominent models for the next-gen platform.</p><p>But I don't really care..  It's a crappy game that has some great B-movie moments.</p><p>If you found this game for $10 and didn't have anything else to spend your money on, I'd say go for it.  It's a good way to spend a lazy sunday.Â  Ps..Â  I bought Bullet Witch for $20 at pre-played.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 13, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 12, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">More HSSF dumbass</h3><p>A month or two ago I wrote about a Java package for writing and reading excel documents named POI+HSSF, which stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation + Horrible SpreadSheet Format. <a href="/old/v6/poihssf-using-excel-with-java" title="/poihssf-using-excel-with-java">Read all about it.</a></p><p>Today, I had to write an importer for a bunch of data in an excel sheet, so I figured I should use what I know.

O_o?? what?  I debugged my code, and found out the numeric value of cell was 39366.0.  "Ok," I thought..  "I can see where POI may have thought it was 10/11, or 10/11/2007.. but those don't add up."</p><p>I called over a co-worker to show him this weird-ness, and one of us suddenly thought.. maybe it's number of days.  I divided the number by 365 and sure enough.. it equated to 107.8..  which is about that many years since 1900.  haha!  success!</p><p>I changed my code to work with this...<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span />        return new Date(millis);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Well, this is also incorrect..  My dates would come back with the correct day, but the year was 2077!  What the...  When using new Date(millis), the millis is the number of milliseconds from January 1st, 1970, not 1900.  So, now I need to correct for that.<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span /> <span />        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />        cal.setTimeInMillis(millis); //days since 1970<br/><span />        cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, cal.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 70); //remove 70 years diff.</p><p><span />        return cal.getTime();<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e);<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>After using Java's standard way of messing with dates, we've done it!  Correctly written a function that should have already been part of the POI+HSSF sdk.</p><p>but wait!</p><p>I started getting a couple of NumberFormatExceptions with my importation.  Apparently, a couple cells in the excel sheet ARE actual text fields and not dates.  These fields simply had a date in the month/day format..  no year.</p><p>So... now I had to account for this...<br/><pre>public Date parseDate(HSSFCell cell)<br/>{<br/><span />    try<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        double days = cell.getNumericCellValue(); //days since 1900<br/><span />        long millis = (long) days * 86400000; //days to millis<br/><span /> <span />        Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />        cal.setTimeInMillis(millis); //days since 1970<br/><span />        cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, cal.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 70); //remove 70 years diff.</p><p><span />        return cal.getTime();<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    catch(NumberFormatException e)<br/><span />    {<br/><span />        try<br/><span />        {<br/><span />            String date = cell.getRichStringCellValue().getString();<br/><span />            Date dates = DATE_FORMAT.parse(date);</p><p><span />            Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();<br/><span />            cal.setTime(dates);<br/><span />            cal.set(Calendar.YEAR, 2007); //assumes year is 2007<br/><span />            return cal.getTime();<br/><span />        }<br/><span />        catch(ParseException e2)<br/><span />        {<br/><span />            throw new RuntimeException("Error parsing date.", e2);<br/><span />        }<br/><span />    }<br/><span />    return null;<br/>}</pre><br/>Ok..  looks good, right?  wrong..  If the cell is empty, HSSF considers this as 0 for Numeric and "" for String values.  So, I need to add in some checks so we don't parse an empty cell as a date, which would come back as January 1st, 1900.  Also, a null check for cell, would be a good idea too.</p><p>This whole function has begun to really bulk up..  I guess that's why they don't have it in their SDK.</p><div class='title'><b>Who Cares?</b></div><p>Anyways, I thought it was rather interesting that Excel stores dates as days.  I guess that means you can't store a date/time value in a single cell then.  One cell for the date, the other cell for the time.</p><p>I find it also kinda funny that Microsoft and Java don't agree on when to start the day counter.  I swear I've seen another program or language that counts days or time starting at 1940.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 12, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 7, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Super Mario Galaxy hype</h3><p>For a while there I really wasn't feeling the need to play Super Mario Galaxy, but now I'm a victim of the hype!  Whee.</p><div class='title'><b>Why don't I care?</b></div><p>I'm not really that big a fan of platforming, anymore.  I loved all the Nintendo Super Mario Brothers games, and loved the ones on the Super Nintendo.. I loved Sonic the Hedgehog as well..  but at the end of the Super Nintendo's life cycle..  Squaresoft, Enix and other RPGs had really caught my attention..</p><p>With so much time on my hands, I felt playing RPGs that lasted 40 - 60 hours with a interesting characters, a rich story, and a level building system gave me a better gaming experience than playing a single character that went level to level.  Even though the later required actual skill, I could complete the game in a matter of hours.  RPGs gave me more bang for my buck, thus were a better value.</p><p>So, I was too busy with Final Fantasy and Playstation games to really care about Mario 64 and the Nintendo 64.  Many people glorify Mario 64 as being the pivotal point in their video game history where what they thought what video games could do was completely throw out the window.</p><p>Mario 64 presented a world where you could go anywhere in the world that was presented, but I didn't really see it that way.  Mario 64 just seemed like Super Mario Brothers in 3D.  You have Goombas to jump on, blocks to break, and browser to toss into lava.  To me, it was the same paradigm in a different dimension.</p><p>It wasn't until Legend of Zelda came to the third dimension that I was absolutely blown away with what Nintendo was doing.  No other game at the time had story, exploration, and growth that was presented in Ocarina of Time.  I was completed floored.</p><p>I get why people are so excited about Mario Galaxy..  This is the next true sequel to the Mario series, and everyone has that warm feeling in their heart when they first played a Mario game and knows this feeling will resurface.</p><div class='title'><b>What do i care now?</b></div><p>I care now because this is what I've realized..  This is that boyish dream of waking up Christmas morning to find Super Mario Brothers and an NES underneath the tree and playing it continuously for the rest of the day and the day after that.  Mario really brings out that fun youthful gaming spirit inside of you that has been so dormant thanks to the Xbox.</p><p>Games are fun, imaginative, creative, colorful, and brilliant and thats what Mario has brought to gaming.  That's how Mario revitalized gaming when Nintendo launched the NES in America.  That's how Mario made the Super Nintendo the fastest adopted gaming system on the planet, until Playstation 2 a couple years later.</p><p>Mario leaves of wake of goodness and happiness the whole world can enjoy, so why not share in its glory ^_^.</p><p>Also, Toys R Us is offering a $25 gift card with the purchase of Mario Galaxy, so you're really getting it for 1/2 price..  How could I say no?</p><div class='title'><b>Victim of 1up hype</b></div><p>Well besides those reasons, Jeremy Parish and others at 1up.com have really been preaching its gospel for the past week to the point where I really want to have that great magical game experience they've been talking about.  They've hit me in 3 different ways..</p><p><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908">Retronauts podcasts, episode 31</a> with Jeremy Parish, Scott Sharky, Shane Bettenhausen, Andrew Pfister and Chris Kohler talking about the Nintendo Super Mario Brothers titles, how they felt when first exposed, and how the 3 3D super mario games draw parallels to the first 3 2D marios.</p><p>Jeremy Parish continues with his <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3164124&sec=REVIEWS" title="http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3164124&sec=REVIEWS">premiere review</a> on Super Mario Galaxy.  It's a very fresh review that really doesn't go into specifics but conveys the groundwork for a ground breaking game.  His review portreys Mario Galaxy as an instant classic that redefines the platforming genre.</p><p>Parish continues, yet again, with a featured spot on <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3145462" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3145462">The 1up Show</a>.  The middle section is all about Mario Galaxy, with Parish gushing about specifics of the game, along with Shane Bettenhausen and Dan Hsu.  The skits of Parish anxiously waiting for his copy in the mail are hilarious.  Especially when he finally receives it. ^_^</p><p>I'm quite a fan of Parish's work, his podcast and his art, so constantly hearing him talk about this game with such high praise, really drives the point home with me.</p><div class='title'><b>One week!</b></div><p>So today, I pre-ordered my copy at Toys R Us and will probably be there Monday morning when the game releases to ensure my copy and my $25 gift card.  I'll probably hold on to the card for a while until Ghost Squad or Resident Evil Chronicles becomes cheap, or hell.. maybe i'll pick up Zach & Wiki.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 7, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 6, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Undeclared</h3><p>My whole reason for signing up with Netflix was to rent Undeclared.  Undeclared is a TV show that aired on Fox beginning in 2000 and lasting one mere season before being canceled.  Much like other brilliant Fox comedies, we hardly knew ye.</p><div class='title'><b>Premise</b></div><p>Undeclared centers on Steven Karp, new freshman to the University of Northeastern California.  Now in college, Steven is able to shed his geek nature and start a new life.  His roommates are Lloyd, a dashing british exchange student going for a degree in theater, Ron, a business major played by Seth Rogen, and Marshall, a scruffy looking guy working on a music degree despite his parents pushing his into business.</p><p>The first night of college changes Steven's life as he meets Lizzie, a cute girl from across the hall with an overprotective boyfriend at home, played by Jason Segal.  Her roommate is Rachael, whose having her own problems with adjusting to college.</p><p>Each episode attempts to center on a specific topic of adjusting to college life, much like Freaks and Geeks did for High School and home life.</p><div class='title'><b>Interest</b></div><p>Undeclared was created by Judd Apatow, which was the sole purpose for my initial interest in the show.  He also co-created Freaks and Greeks which I've written about before (<a href="/old/v6/freaks-and-geeks" title="/freaks-and-geeks">here</a> and <a href="/old/v6/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts" title="/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">here</a>).  He's also been chiefly responsible for 40 year old virgin, Knocked Up and Superbad.  All with the underlying theme of Freaks and Geeks..  Freaks being pot heads and burn outs, and Geeks being..  geeks.  Because they follow this pattern, Judd Apatow's properties are full of movie references and drug humor which our generation can easily identify with.</p><p>Undeclared is no different than the rest but really shows Apatow's true calling in his craft.  Don't get me wrong, I think Freaks and Geeks is probably his greatest show to date, but it's too heavy and too real.  I feel so much emotion when watching that show, I'm not sure how more of it I can take..  Undeclared takes a step back from that and focuses more on the comedy.  The comedy floats to the surface and lets the subtle drama aspects govern the plot, but not the scene.</p><p>The Office uses a similar formula.  You come to the show for its comedy, but stay and continue to watch because of the characters and their relationships.  The Office wouldn't work with any other actors playing these characters, and neither would Undeclared.</p><p>Squeezing the show into half an hour really forces the comedy to take center stage too.  There's really no time to build a compelling drama high in such a short time and still make it funny.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>This show is pretty damn hilarious..  Each character and actor complements each other so well..  It makes the show incredibly believable and enjoyable.  Definitely check it out ^_^</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 6, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 5, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Writer's Guild of America on Strike</h3><p>For the past couple of weeks, Lostpedia has had some updates with the possibility of a WGA strike, and last night it became officially. Â  The Writer's Guild of America's Contract ended on Halloween and without fair wages and proper benefits to renew their contract, they strike! Which means if this is not resolved in a timely matter, all our favorite shows will see some major hiatus.</p><p>As the article states, Late night shows will be the first to suffer and won't be seen tonight.  Sitcoms and Dramas, such as The Office, 30 Rock, and Heroes have roughly 5 unaired episodes at their disposal, which will keep the shows "new" until the end of November.</p><p>For Lost, lostpedia says that they are in the middle of filming episode 4 of season 4, but with plans to air the show without hiatus, we may see Lost season 4 a bit later than February next year.</p><p>Honestly though, this isn't so bad.  It'll give us a chance to wake up for our television coma, just as we did in the summer months.  We can go outside and enjoy the winter when TV runs out of TV at the end of November.  Plenty of time to start renting TV shows out on DVD.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34688">Ain't it cool news</a></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 5, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 2, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Final Fantasy Tactics Impressions</h3><p>Last Friday, when I picked up Freaks and Geeks, Pre-played also had a copy of Final Fantasy Tactics for a mere $30.  $10 cheaper than MSRP was a good enough deal for me as I plucked the case off the shelf and proceeded to the register.</p><p>The next morning I closed to book on Gurumin, and began my adventures in the infant land of Ivalice.</p><div class='title'><b>History</b></div><p>Originally released on the Playstation in February 1998 in the US, gamers flocked to this game thanks to the Final Fantasy brand.  Sales were pretty good thanks to Final Fantasy 7's release 5 months prior, but didn't sell as well.  It sold a million copies, but eventually diminished off shelves and became fairly difficult to find.</p><p>I picked up my own copy the day it came out along with my pal, Justin.  Working in the video games section of Toys R Us in those days, made it very easy to get my hands on any video game that was released.  I just needed to set it aside when the shipment came in..  The same type of thing we did with Action Figures when uploading trucks.</p><p>I played the crap out of the game.  I got all the secret characters, beat all the secret dungeons and levels..  I loved this game quite a bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Quality</b></div><p>What puts Final Fantasy Tactics on such a pedestal is its fairly simple and well-balanced gameplay.  Few Strategy RPGs have been so much fun and challenging at the same time.  Even its sequel, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance couldn't even live up to the original.</p><p>The musical score and art style are what really kept me in the game.  The music is wonderfully orchestrated, and the character art is very old-world european.  It feels like you're playing an instant classical masterpiece.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>I sometimes wonder how so many people like this game when the first 3 or 4 battles beat the crap out of you.  When I first played the game back in 1998, I took me several attempts to complete the 3 battle in the game.  This is the battle in the town with the archers picking you off one by one.  It's really interesting that the same problems I had starting off with the game in 1998, are the same problems I'm having today in 2007.  Those goddamn archers..</p><p>So..  either Final Fantasy Tactics difficultly and challenge has stood the test of time, or my skill as a Strategy RPG gamer hasn't improved in 9 years.  :shrugs:  I played through Disgaea, Phantom Brave and La Pucelle without a problem, so I can't be too bad..  even though, those are level grinders.</p><div class='title'><b>Strategy</b></div><p>Those first couple of battles are annoying, but once you've gotten your feet wet and begin diving into the job system, you'll find yourself in heaven learning more skills and finding new strategic ways to implement them on the battle field.</p><p>Through playing the game previously, my best strategy consistently killing everyone on the battle field in two turns was having two Mathematicians with 1st turn and Holy.  Everyone else on my team had that armor that would absorb the Holy spell, so my Mathematicians would cast the spell on the entire battle field one after the other.</p><div class='title'><b>Differences between Playstation 1 and PSP</b></div><p>Squaresoft added a couple new goodies to the PSP version.  There are one or two new hidden characters along with all the original hidden characters.  There are multiple player maps you can play with or against a friend.  There are two new Job classes: Onion Knight, and Dark Knight.  (and) There are some cutscenes mixed into the game and pivotal moments.</p><p>The cutscenes are quite beautiful and stick with the original art style beautifully.</p><p>Another change is a complete re-translation/localization of the entire game.  Instead of goofy dialogue and an unintelligible story, you can actually follow along with the plot and figure out what's going on.  The dialogue is in "ye old English" style, much like Final Fantasy XII, which continues consistency throughout Squaresoft's Ivalice properties.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Anyways, starting off Final Fantasy Tactics can be a little rough, but once you learn the Job and Skill trees, you'll have a lot of fun.  I haven't gotten a chance to play any multiplayer, but I probably will in the next week or so.  I'm still a little bit behind Tony, so I want to catch up. ^_^</p><p>If you're a fan of Final Fantasy or Strategy RPGs, definitely pick it up..  Though, $40 is kind of expensive for a 9 year old game.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 2, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 1, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">The Office tonight</h3><p>Has Tonight's episode of NBC's smash hit The Office begun a story arc that will encompass the rest of the season and into the next.?  Now that they jumped the shark at the end of season 3, I was really wonder what they were going to do with the show..</p><div class='title'><b>Recap</b></div><p>Last season, everyone finally got what they wanted when after 3 season of tickling our assholes, Jim finally made a move to date Pam.  This story arc really began in Season 2 when Jim's feelings  surfaced episode after episode of awkwardness.  At the end Season 2, he finally told her about his love before she married Roy.</p><p>Jim saw this as his last opportunity to profess his feelings before taking a job in New York to get away from these feelings.  Season 3 began rather awkward focusing on Jim in the New York and the regular cast back in the Scranton branch.  Pam had called off the wedding and began searching for what she wanted.  While at the New York branch, Jim started dating fellow co-worker Karen..</p><p>Eventually these two branches became one and bits of drama began to ensue..  Now that Pam was free, it took all season for Jim to realize what he wanted was there, and that Karen was out of desperation.</p><p>6 weeks in, Karen has come back into the show and we find that she's a general manager of her own branch of Dunder Miflin.</p><div class='title'><b>Business Side of things</b></div><p>There are two points of business at work for this show..  There really is no overall story anymore with Jim and Pam together.  They tried to do something with Dwight and Angela, but their characters are as captivating as Jim and Pam.  The same with Michael and Jan.  These romances are more comical than real..  they have their moments, but not enough to carry the show.</p><p>At the same time, NBC's Thursday night line-up has a flat-tire at 8.30pm.  Scrubs is a funny show, but once you've seen a bunch of episodes, you've seen it all.  Except for story elements, you could watch a new episode and swear you've seen it before..  Scrubs will end in May 2008, so what the hell are they going to do to replace it?</p><p>News Article: <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/34619">NBC developing The Office 2</a></p><p>It looks like The Office will be trailing The Office next fall in place of the Scrubs time slot..</p><div class='title'><b>Speculation?</b></div><p>With tonight's episode with Karen managing the Uttica branch of Dunder Miflin..  Is this the beginning of The Office 2?  Will this season start to tear apart itself after season 3 began stitching the cast back together at Scranton?</p><p>This doesn't sound like a particularly great idea..  The Office really works because of its great cast..  finding another cast as balanced and hilarious will not be easy..  I think it would have a LONG way to go without feeling like a complete ripoff.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 1, 2007<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">November 2007</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-office-tonight">1</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/final-fantasy-tactics-impressions">2</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/writers-guild-of-america-on-strike">5</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/undeclared">6</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/super-mario-galaxy-hype">7</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/more-hssf-dumbass">12</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/xbox-360-bullet-witch">13</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/super-mario-galaxy-impressions">14</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/super-mario-galaxy-further-thoughts">18</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/heroes-and-journeyman">19</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/uggs">20</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/mass-effect-impressions">22</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/bye-bye-oldsmobile">24</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/35w-update">25</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/nbc-monday-night-updates">26</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/journeyman-final-episode-will-air">28</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
