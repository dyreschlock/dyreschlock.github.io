After the massive success of the 2009 film adaptation of The Watchmen, DC began thinking about ways it could further monetize the series with the surge of new fans.  I didn't even realize these comics were finally out until I visited my local comic book store.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1889.webp"  /></p><p>Before Watchmen is a series of 7 separate comic book series where each series focuses on a single character from The Watchmen, except the comic series, The Minutemen, which focuses solely on the original group of masked vigilantes that preceded The Watchmen.  Each comic explains the origins or motives behind the character leading into the story of The Watchmen itself.</p><p>The idea is that a new comic will come out each week from June until January.  You can find the schedule from this website <a href="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035" title="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035">here</a>.  The Minutemen, Ozymandias, and The Comedian all are 6 issues series, whereas the other 4, Silk Spectre, Nite Owl, Dr. Manhattan, and Rorschach are all 4 issues series.  All in all, there are 34 issues, and plus an extra 48-page one shot to tie everything together at the end.  We are 3 weeks into June, and as such, there have only been 3 issues released so far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1894.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Controversy</b></div><p>The most vocal person against the idea of more Watchmen comics is one of the creators, <b>Alan Moore</b>.  In 2009, just as DC was about the launch the movie, Alan Moore spoke out about how this film was nothing more than a money making scheme.  DC had run out of ideas, and the only way to make money was to take projects with integrity that stand on their own, and somehow cash them in.  He even refused to accept any royalties he would've received from the creation of the film.</p><p>In that case, I think any complaints he had about the idea of a film were quickly drowned out by the overwhelming positive praise of the film's execution.  For years, people said you couldn't do a Watchmen movie because it was too complicated, but Zack Snyder pulled it off, in my opinion and many others.  It was fantastic, and (mostly) stuck strictly to the script of the comic.</p><p>Alan Moore is back again in the spotlight as a HUGE dissenter of Before Watchmen.  A few years after the original comic of The Watchmen was finished in the 1980s, Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons were thinking about how they might expand the series.  They thought about having a story focus on each character, but didn't really think it would work.  They really wanted to do a full story about The Minutemen, though, but DC weren't interested at the time.  For years, DC shot down any ideas Alan Moore brought up about a revival of The Watchmen, and created some rather bad blood between the two.</p><p>So when, DC finally came back to Alan Moore about expanding The Watchmen in the mid-2000s (citation needed), Alan Moore refused.  And he has been incredibly against the idea of Watchmen revival ever since.</p><p>So, the actual <b>controversy</b> of these books is "will they actually live up to the original comics."  Is this just another ploy for cash they will ultimately cheapen The Watchmen franchise.  Or are these new books actually just?  Are these worthwhile reads, and important to the overall story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Minutemen #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1903.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1905.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1897.webp"  /></p><p>For The Minutemen, I think this issue matches the expectations.  It focuses on the development of The Minutemen as a group, framed in Hollis writing his novel.  It introduces all the characters, their psyche, motives, and personalities, and ends on the catalyst that brings them all together.</p><p>While I'm not a huge fan of the art in the original comic, I can definitely respect the art in The Minutemen.  It's carefully constructed in such a way you feel like you're reading the original.  The dialogue is set up the same.  The art is the same.  And the flow of the comic is exactly the same too.  It's a new Watchmen comic.  All the pieces are there.  And the story is pretty solid so far.</p><p>I think it's pretty good :)</p><div class='title'><b>Silk Spectre #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1899.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1900.webp"  /></p><p>On the other hand, we have Silk Spectre.  The art does not mimic the original, and neither does the story telling.  It's a completely new comic.  And I think this is what Alan Moore was afraid of.</p><p>Silk Spectre #1 tells the story of Silk Spectre II in high school, and her first romance.  As indicated by the second photo, occasionally a panel will have a Chibi version of the character expressing an inner emotion.  The type of thing you'd find in a comic designed for girls.</p><p>Also, the story is a typical high school girl rebel story of falling in love, and doing anything to be with that unrequited love.  Romeo and Juliet, and so forth.  Another easy stereotypical plot device often used in story designed for girls.</p><p>So, Silk Spectre #1 is pretty dumb, and shameless.  It's specifically trying to pull in the female audience through the ONE female character in the story.  Ohhh, since she's female she's gotta have a high school love story.  And she's a tomboy, so all the other girls make fun of her.  Blah blah blah... it's so cliche.</p><p>But I do like how the comic has its own identity.  This is Silk Spectre's story, and it's completely framed using her personality.  The art is different and unique compared to the other comic, and so is the story.</p><div class='title'><b>The Comedian #1</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1901.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120623_watchmen/IMG_1902.webp"  /></p><p>The Comedian follows the same suit.  It's written and drawn by different people, so it has a look and feel and storytelling style of its own.</p><p>The story of the comedian so far is a bit boring.  But it's building to something quite a bit larger.  In the beginning of the comic, Eddie Blake is playing football with John F Kennedy, and Robert Kennedy on the White House lawn.  It establishes that they're all very good friends, and they know each other pretty well.</p><p><b>Spoilers</b>, but at the end of Issue #1, Eddie corners Moloch, and Moloch shows Eddie the TV.  JFK has been fatally shot.  Eddie is surprised and shocked, and looks for the nearest amount of alcohol to calm himself.</p><p>Do you remember the slide show at the beginning of The Watchmen film when it goes through the background stories of The Minutemen, and formation of The Watchmen?  There's a scene that shows Eddie Blake as the second gunman behind the grassy knoll during the assassination of JFK.</p><p>So, if that was canon, why would he be surprised when hearing about the assassination from Moloch?  This doesn't seem to make sense.  Though, this might've been something they just added in the movie, and it's not actually canon with the book.  But I don't think Zack Snyder was adding in random shit at the beginning.</p><p>I'm curious to see how this continues.</p><div class='title'><b>More to come!</b></div><p>Looking at <a href="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035" title="http://www.firstcomicsnews.com/?p=43035">the schedule</a> once again, Comedian #6 is one of the final comics to be released, along with Ozymandias and The Minutemen.  It feels like those are the 3 PRIME story driven comics out of all of these.</p><p>I mean, who really cares about Silk Spectre when she's not around Dr. Manhattan or Nite Owl.  I want to know more about The Minutemen, and the pure motives behind Ozymandias' overall deceit.  Though, I'm sure Dr. Manhattan and Rorschach's stories will be very entertaining on their own.</p><p>Anyways, a new Watchmen comic every week for the next 7 months?  Hell yeah, why not.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 24, 2012<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 21, 2012</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">The Spring Awakening @ Soldier Field, Chicago</h3><p>Last weekend was The Spring Awakening held in Chicago.  It used to be a single night event with two or three major headliners, but with the massive popularity of electronic dance music continuing to surge, and React, the promotion company, continuing to pull off massive successful events, The Spring Awakening has expanded to an entire two day music festival.  It took place at Soldier Field in Chicago, and had the main stage on to the football field itself.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1120.webp"  /></p><p>When The Spring Awakening was first announced I was super excited because the (initial) lineup included <b>Markus Schulz</b> and <b>Ferry Corsten</b>, two heavy hitters in Trance.  One of my favorite duos, <b>Gabriel &amp; Dresden</b> were also on the bill.  And <b>Moby</b>, too!  Later on <b>Carl Cox</b> and <b>Green Velvet</b> were also added.</p><p>On the other side of the coin were acts such as Skrillex, Wolfgang Gartner, Laidback Luke, Benny Benassi, Diplo, etc, etc.  I tried to like these guys when they started to become popular, but I can't get into it.  There's no atmosphere, or melody for me to enjoy.  I really don't dig its sound.  It's not relaxing, or uplifting, or groovy.  It doesn't take me on a journey.  Blah blah blah... damn kids.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday</b></div><p>I arrived around 6pm on Saturday.  I took a look around for a while, and proceeded to the "Trance" Tent, aka 'Da Drive Stage' where Morgan Page, Gabriel & Dresden, and Markus Schulz were going to perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1150.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1157.webp"  /></p><p>Joachim Garraud was already spinning some tunes when I arrived.  There's no way this guy is a real DJ.  The last half of set had so many randomly stereotypical popular songs.  "We are your Friends", "Smack my Bitch up", and "Sandstorm"!  Sandstorm!  In 2012, Sandstorm was played at one of the largest dance events Chicago has ever held.  It blows my mind that anyone would consider playing that song.</p><p>After that horrible experience, Morgan Page hopped on stage and played a rather mediocre set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1170.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1197.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1215.webp"  /></p><p>I had been making my way up to the front throughout Morgan Page's set.  Once he left the stage, he took a lot of the audience with him.  I suppose everyone left for  <b>Ferry Corsten</b> on the main stage, but I stuck around for Gabriel &amp; Dresden.</p><p>Unfortunately, they performed a very standard set.  :/  Out of all their tracks, there was only one that I hadn't heard before.  I had a lot of fun hopping around to all of their recent hits, but there were no surprises whatsoever.  They could've played some amazing classic Trance hit, or wowed everyone with a new Mashup, but it felt like we got the minimal amount of what they were willing to do.  They really phoned it in. :(  What a waste...</p><p>I probably should have joined everyone else for Ferry Corsten, but I still had a good time rocking out to the tunes.

He played an absolutely phenomenal set.  Absolutely amazing.  It felt like time literally stopped in the aura of atmosphere he spun with his set.  The vibe never quit, and continued to build and build and build.  It was awe inspiring.  I feel bad for having listened to him on Internet radio for more than 10 years, and JUST NOW seeing him live.  Out of an evening of mediocre and terrible performances, Markus Schulz shined so brightly.</p><p>Horse Head guy was blown away too!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1284.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1292_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Markus closed out the Trance Tent for the evening, and everyone begun to question whether to outright leave, or go into Soldier Field for Skrillex.  I'll admit that I did like Skrillex in the beginning.  His sound was quite different than everything else.  It was very fresh and distinct.</p><p>But now the industry is completely saturated by imitators and trend-followers.  I listened to Skrillex's set for about 20 minutes, and was surprised how his sound has completely faded into the genre he (somewhat) created.  I thought Skrillex was supposed to be at the front of this sound, but he sounds just like everyone else. it feels like he's having a hard time differentiating himself from his followers.  The only real difference he has is his signature look, and his ridiculous amount of energy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1332.webp"  /></p><p>So, I left.

His DJ performances are a stark difference than his original work.  His original work is very ambient and uplifting, whereas his DJ performance are very hard and energetic.</p><p>His DJ performances used to be super super rare, but ever since 'Last Night' in 2008, he's been back in the clubs, and each year he's been DJing more and more.  I came across a couple of his recorded sets, and wrote my impressions about it <a href="/old/v6/moby-djing" title="/moby-djing">here</a>, but I never had the chance to actually hear him live.</p><p>Today was finally the day, and his set turned out exactly how he had portrayed himself in those recordings.  High energy, but overall lacking.  I wouldn't say it lacked individuality, but it's missing something...  for me, anyway.  There's no hook.  There's no...  something.  His sets aren't really memorable.  I don't know.</p><p>Maybe it's just hard for me to separate Moby the artist, from Moby the DJ.  Maybe I'm just giving him a pass because I know he's a good artist.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120616_spring_awakening/IMG_1856_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Anyway, I left before Moby finished his set, so I could return to Madison and get to work the next day.</p><p>Markus Schulz, Derrick Carter, Green Velvet, and Carl Cox made my weekend, and I was quite satisfied.  Gabriel &amp; Dresden were fun, but were a bit disappointing.  Moby was ok, and I missed Ferry Corsten, but other than there were no other DJs and artists I really cared about.</p><p>The Spring Awakening was mostly a festival that mirrored the sound of today's electronic dance generation, and not my own.  That's why I am SUPER excited for the Wavefront Music Festival at the end of June.  This is packed full of the sounds I love, and artists I follow.

I think this is the first Lego product I've bought (or received) in the last 20 years.  Some might think the idea of Lego Minecraft is ironic.  Others might say this serves absolutely no purpose.  Some might say this was only a matter of time.  And others might say it's art imitating art.</p><p>Minecraft is a computer game developed by swedish person Markus Persson, where you can destroy any piece of the environment, pick that piece up, and place it where ever you want.  Many people describe this game as Legos in of itself, as you move around pieces, and build whatever you want.  That's the mining part of Minecraft.</p><p>The other part of Minecraft is the crafting.  You can take these pieces that you've mined and created new objects, and build more elaborate structures beyond what the environment has given you to begin with.  And you can do whatever you want.</p><p>Many people describe Minecraft is "playing with Legos." In fact, you could argue that Minecraft is the truest most best Lego video game ever created.  Lego has put its stamp on countless other games and all that them fail at the basic concept of what Lego is 'built' on...</p><p>So it IS deeply ironic that this concept has come full circle into the physical realm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1049.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1053.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1055.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Development</b></div><p>This set of Legos has been in development since November last year.  As you might have noticed above, the brand Lego Cuusoo is thrown around a little bit.  Cuusoo is an online development program where Lego creators bring their ideas to a vote.</p><p>Here's the original Cuusoo entry for Minecraft : <a href="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038" title="http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038">http://lego.cuusoo.com/ideas/view/4038</a></p><p>All Cuusoo ideas are submitted and put to a vote.  If the idea gets 10,000 supporters, it goes into a development phase where the creators must prove their idea.  Once they've come up with a physical build of the Lego product, it's put in front of a panel of judges, and they vote on whether or not the product actually comes to market.</p><p>Legos are WAAYYYY more serious these days then they were when I was a kid.  I mean, at heart, they are still a kid's toy, and they plenty of sets for children.  But they have advanced sets for the people who grew up with the toy, and enjoy the simple aesthetic.  And even beyond that, this Cuusoo system is there for the people who enjoy building something out of nothing: The architect.  These days the toy goes beyond an age range, and delves into the intellectual range.</p><p>It's awesome that there's this creative outlet for all Lego architects out there, but I've almost always been more interested in the building aspect of Legos.  I liked deviating from the instructions when I was a kid, but I never had the resources to build something from nothing.  These days you can visit any of the Legoland locations and buy any specific Lego piece you need.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1056.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1063.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Building</b></div><p>Building this thing was pretty fun.  I followed the instructions, and built everything 'correctly'.  Minecraft has always been about digging under the surface and finding all the hidden treasures.  Through building a scene of your own, you are doing the exact opposite.  You are placing all the hidden ore, and items in the environment and covering them up.  It's almost like you're acting like the scenery generator in the game itself.</p><p>There are gold blocks and diamond blocks that are very obviously placed, but there are other elements placed within the scene that are completely obscured when viewing the finished product.  In the end, the builder is the only one that knows they're there.  It's a secret.</p><p>There's also a Lego Steve, and a Lego Creeper available in the set.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1067.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1073.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1087.webp"  /></p><p>Overall, I guess it's kind of dumb.  Despite Legos' timeless and ageless construction, I feel like I've grown out of them.  I loved them as a kid, but the aesthetic just doesn't do anything for me anymore.  I get that the limited construction of the tool has pushed the creativity of its users well beyond what it was originally intended for, and built its own community, Cuusoo, based on that, but...  I just feel like I'm passed them.  I don't enjoy the aesthetic anymore.  It's too distinctive.</p><p>Once the Lego structure is built...  then what?  It just sits on display.</p><p>But... I do appreciate this Lego set.  <b>I find it as art imitating art.</b> There are clear choices made in its construction that imitate the game exactly.  A 1x1x2 block of Lego is equivalent to a block in Minecraft, and that is consistent throughout the entire model.  You can't really mine any of the pieces, but its construction and existence mirrors the game.</p><p>It's very well done, and representative of the game.  Much like the feeling of building a home, or any structure in Minecraft channels the fun you had with Legos as a kid.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1109.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1115.webp"  /></p><p>Anyway...  I like it.  I feel like the abstract nature of Lego is a perfect physical representation of Minecraft.</p><div class='title'><b>Update : June 18th</b></div><p>As you may have noticed from one of the photos above, I had enough Legos to make an extra head for Steve.  I did not have enough pieces left over to make a body, though, so I saw this as a sign to complete one of those quirky life goals on my bucket list: <b>Go to Legoland to purchase a single Lego piece.</b></p><p>I was in Chicago this weekend, and the suburbs of Chicago have two Lego stores right next to each other.  There's the Lego Store in Woodfield Mall, and the Lego Discovery Center just outside.  Each store has a thing called 'Pick a Brick' where they have bins of multiple colors and sizes of Legos bricks, and you can fill up a bucket with all the pieces you want.  It's generally $10 for 10lbs (if I recall), and the selection is limited for each store.</p><p>The Lego Discovery Center has the exact sized block I needed, but only in Bright Orange.  I went inside the Woodfield Mall, and they didn't have any bricks of that size at all.  BUT!  The trip was still a success.  I was able to purchase my 1x1 brick and create a friend for Steve to play with.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1870.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120615_minecraft/IMG_1875.webp" /><br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 15, 2012<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 13, 2012</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Invisible Monsters Remix</h3><p>On Monday, Chuck Palahniuk released his newest book Invisible Monsters Remix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1009.webp"  /></p><p>This is an enhanced re-release of his third published novel originally released in 1999.  Despite being his third published, it was actually the first full novel Palahniuk had ever written.  He originally shopped it around to publishers, but they didn't like the characters, and thought the story was over the top.  He wrote Fight Club as a response to their rejections, and it became his first published novel.</p><p>After Fight Club and Survivor, Palahniuk had a successful track record with his publisher, and they gave the go ahead for Invisible Monsters.  It had been years since he had written the book, and he felt disingenuous releasing a full-fledged hardcover edition, so it was only ever released in paperback form. It was his only book to not have a hardcover edition.</p><p>Fans have been requesting and petitioning Chuck for a hardcover version of the book, and this week they finally got it.  And it has a lot more, too.  The original book has 27 chapters of linear story, while Remix has 42 chapters of non-linear story.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1044.webp"  /></p><p>Chuck wanted to book to have the feeling of a magazine.  Most magazines break up their articles with the first couple of paragraphs in the front of the book, and dump the rest of the text near the back.  You can start the book anywhere you want.  And if you like what you're reading, continue to the next linear chapter, otherwise just continue to the next numerical chapter.</p><p>After skimming through the book, I noticed that the original Chapter 1 of Invisible Monsters is Chapter 41 in the Remix version, and the final chapter, 27, is now Chapter 21.  The image above is from the end of Chapter 41 in remix.  Even though, Chapter 1 has a nice start of its own, you'd be missing a single chapter in the whole story if you start there.</p><p>Also some chapters have mirrored text for some reason.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1039.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1033.webp"  /></p><p>In typical geek fashion, I ordered my copy through St. Helens Bookstore, which is Palahniuk's favorite local bookstore.  Leading up to the release of any of his books, he'll sign all copies pre-ordered through that venue.  These are the same types of signatures you can find in the books when he tours around the country promoting them.  But with Invisible Monsters Remix, he only toured to 4 cities, all on the west coast, so these signed books might be more scarce than his others.</p><p>Also, scattered throughout the book is random party glitter, some red stamped kisses, and "postcards from hell" promos for his newest novel, Damned, released last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1016.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1014.webp"  /></p><p>I look forward to reading this one again.  Especially since I barely remember anything that happened in the book.  His first five novels all seem to follow a predictable formula.  There's always 3 major characters: the narrator, the friend, and the love interest.  There tends to be more character than that, but there's always these 3.  All 3 of them tend to suffer from some kind of mental or physical illness, and eventually one of them dies.</p><p>All 5 of his original novels have them same tone as well.  It's very dark, and gritty, and nihilistic with amazing detail into mundane activities.  Calculative, efficient, and professional, but with a distance from reality and society.  That's what really drew me to Palahniuk in the first place.  His writing style is so visceral and atmospheric that I can lose myself in his story, and place myself in the character.</p><p>Over the years, he's tried to do things a bit different and break away from the molds he created.  Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't.  I think Rant and Pygmy captured some of his original magic, but some of his other novels have fallen flat with me.  Snuff and Tell-All in particular were ones that I could not relate to at all.  I still haven't read Damned yet. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120613_invisible/IMG_1028.webp"  /></p><p>But with Invisible Monsters Remix, he's up to 15 published books, and he has the two sequels to Damned yet to finish and publish.  He works pretty damn hard.  Each year, he has a new book published, so there's plenty material for his fans.  His website, chuckpalahniuk.net, has monthly writing workshops, so it's not too difficult to get into contact with him, and all of his fanbase.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 13, 2012<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 8, 2012</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">E3 2012</h3><p>Each year, all the high profile gaming companies get together in Los Angeles, and showcase all of their upcoming tech and games for the next year, and beyond.  This is E3, the Electronic Entertainment Expo, and for gamers, it's one of the most exciting times of the year.</p><p>I really wasn't sure what to expect from E3 this year.  I was excited, but really had no idea what they were going to show, or what surprises might await.  For some us, the anticipation and excitement of being surprised is just like Christmas.</p><p>Gaming really hasn't been all spectical and fun for the last year.  Every month, another couple of game studios go bankrupt and shut down.  Every month, the larger AAA games being released are more homogeneous.  And the games that were once interesting and fresh, end up being canceled or compromised by the mainstream.  It really feels like the games industry is dying, and grasping on to whatever sales are left.</p><p>All the press conferences of E3 felt like it mirrored that sentiment.  They showed off many sequels, and "announced" many games that we had already seen, and knew were in the pipeline.</p><p>But there were a couple games I'm looking forward to.  All is not lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Watch Dogs</b></div><p>Out of all 5 press conferences, this was the only surprise.  A new game that wasn't leaked ahead of time, and a completely new IP as well.  After showing boring title, after boring title, Ubisoft ended with a vague introduction of how digitally interconnected our society is, and how easily it can be exploited.</p><p>This went into a gameplay video where your character can make use of the digital world to get around hurdles in the physical world.  You can listen to phone conversations, disrupt power, and view personal information about any random person walking around.</p><p>This character eventually gets into a confrontation, and engages in a fire fight.  Even though you have these digital powers, you still need a gun to fight. :(  Then he takes off in a car and drives away.</p><p>Watch Dogs is open world too, and from the content, it seems like you're connected to the mob or some other organization.  So, if you boil all the elements down, it's basically Grand Theft Auto, but with internet powers.  BUT!  It takes place in Chicago!  Plus, it looks really really pretty.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcMRkyoHKeA">Youtube Link</a></p><div class='title'><b>Beyond</b></div><p>Sony began it's conference by showing off Quantic Dream's newest game, Beyond.  Studio lead David Cage took the stage and introduced Beyond's main character, Jodie, played by Ellen Page.  They played a cutscene from the game that displayed the range of emotions and tones that you could expect from the game, and finished off with a sizzle clip of some action sequences.</p><p>I like Quantic Dream quite a bit, even though both Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain had their problems.  I like the idea of interactive story, and being able to change the story based on what I've done.  Both those game have that, but missed a note here or there that broke the suspension of disbelief.  Overall, if you let yourself be immersed into it's direction, and atmosphere it becomes an amazing immersive experience.</p><p>Beyond looks like it continues the story driven gameplay that Heavy Rain set out to do.  People who've played it on the show floor, have said that it is much more interactive than Heavy Rain too.  I'm definitely looking forward to this one.</p><div class='title'><b>The Last of Us</b></div><p>Sony ended it's conference with its other big big title.  The Last of Us is post apocalyptic, and takes place in the crumbling city of Pittsburg Pennslyvania.  You play as Joel, and have your 14 year old daughter, Ellie in tow.  It's a third person survival action game, as you search for food, water, and other supplies while avoiding confrontations, and survival any hostile encounters.</p><p>They showed off a live demo of Joel and Ellie making their way through an apartment building and running into a group of hostile men.  It turns into a fire fight, but you only have so many bullets, and have to make use of the environment, and anything around you to survive.  The confrontation goes back and forth between fists and guns.</p><p>Ellie and Joel react and make comments to the situation, as things happen, which is a mainstay of any Naughty Dog title these days.  Uncharted was so entertaining and engaging because of all the banter between Nathan Drake and his pals.  One previewer said that Ellie acted with complete shock when you, as Joel, lit a moltave cocktail and ignited a random dude, and another guy said that didn't even happen in his demo.</p><p>And Ellie interacts in the fights as well.  If you're in trouble during a fight, she might run up a stab the guy in the back, or throw a brick at someone about to shoot you.  The combat has a lot of variety, and she seems to react with just as much variety, too.</p><p>The environments look gorgeous, and all of their previous games have followed through with an engaging and interesting story.  I'm looking forward to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Castlevania Lords of Shadows : Mirrors of Fate</b></div><p>The first game Nintendo showed off during its 3DS conference was Castlevania.  It's been nearly 4 years since we've a side scrolling portable Castlevania game on the Nintendo platform.  It's been so long that I guess I'm excited no matter how the game actually turns out.</p><p>It's a 2.5D game where you play as multiple character in their rebooted universe.  The style reminds me a lot of the PSP game Castlevania Dracule X Chronicles.  But they really isn't any word if it'll be as open world as the Igarashi games were.  I hope it's open world, but a level based Castlevania with branching paths sounds pretty fun too.</p><p>Castlevania is fun, so I'd probably buy this if I had a 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>New Super Mario Bros. 2</b></div><p>New Super Mario 2 looks pretty fun, too, even though it is just more Mario.  This game is all about coins, and trying to collect 1 million coins throughout the course of the game.  They don't really explain why, though, and the whole concept is rather goofy.  100 coins still give you a 1-up, so you'll be drowning in lives as your progress in the game.  I doubt the difficulty will warrant that many 1-ups.  Plus, isn't Wario supposed to be the money-grubbing character?  Why does Mario need all this capital?</p><p>They announced this game along side New Super Mario Bros. U for the Wii U, which is a completely separate game.  I'm not really sure what their gameplan is when they saturate the market with two nearly identical games.</p><p>I dunno...  I liked New Super Mario on the DS, but didn't like New Super Mario on the Wii, so I think that I'll enjoy this new one for the 3DS.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Games</b></div><p>I'll probably buy those 5 games in the future, but there were a couple other games that seemed like they might be fun, but I wouldn't really want to own them.</p><p>The new <b>Tomb Raider</b> looks like it's taking a page out of Uncharted's book, except with worse dialogue and horrible acting.  The whole Uncharted series was based on Tomb Raider, so it feels somewhat odd that originator is now the follower, but whatever.  I'd like to play it.</p><p><b>Assassin's Creed 3</b> looks kinda fun too.  The whole series is about going back in time viewing key moments in history, and now the setting is the American Revolution is the foundation of our country.  I'm interested to see how that fits into something I know a little bit more about rather than Italy, and the other settings.  Also, the ship-based combat looks really pretty, and I love running around in snowy environments.</p><p>The new <b>Need for Speed</b> looks a lot like Burnout Paradise, one of my favorite racing games.  Criterion is behind both games, and as long as it controls more like Burnout Paradise and less like Need for Speed, I think I'll be playing this game quite a bit.</p><div class='title'><b>Huge Disappointments</b></div><p>There was good to be found, amongst all the negativity.  But there were two particular moments of E3 that were absolutely disappointing for me.</p><div class='title'><b>Dead Space 3</b></div><p>I like Dead Space 1 quite a bit.  It had a wonderful immersive atmosphere that made full use of sound to convey emotion.  There were some points where the environment was so loud, you couldn't hear anything else, and there were points of silence where you begged for something to make a sound.  I was completely immersed through and through, and felt like I was there.</p><p>Dead Space 2 began tearing away at that immersion.  Sound wasn't used as heavily, as it relied on scare tactics and some particularly grotesque and horrorific moments to make up for it.  Ultimately, the whole experience felt cheap.  Dead Space 2 was now a horror action game.  You were no longer immersed in exploration.  Plus, they added a multiplayer mode to the game?  The fuck?</p><p>The Dead Space 3 demo shown during the EA conference makes it seem like they don't even know what made Dead Space unique in the first place.  It's completely co-op, and cover-based now you're fighting other humans.  Your weapons no longer rotate or have secondary fires, and you combine them into new weapons?  No more unique ammo either?  They're basically phoning this one in.</p><p>During the demo sequence Isaac and Harry(?) are fighting a drill that has gone hay-wire, and the whole time Harry is freaking out and screaming, "Oh my god", "Shit", "Fuck".  Does this time even know what terror is?  Having a character forcing his emotions on you is not compelling or immersive, it's fucking annoying.  I would probably try to kill him during the fight just to shut him up.</p><div class='title'><b>Wii U</b></div><p>I came into the conference pretty excited for the Wii U.  My Wii has got quite a bit of use over the last 6 months with Legend of Zelda, Xenoblade, and Rhythm Heaven.  Plus, there's The Last Story coming out in a few months, too.  I wanted to know that these games will look great on the new console, and when it'll come out, and how much it'll cost.  Plus, I wanted to know what games I might want to play on it.</p><p>They showed off the finished version of the console, along with a proper Pro controller perfect for playing games without any gimmicks.  They showed off a whole lot of boring games, along with some Wii U version of games already released for PS3 and 360.  They showed off <b>Pikmin 3</b> which looks fun but not a lot different than Pikmin 2.  And that's it.</p><p>They didn't give a price.  They didn't give a date.  They didn't announce any compelling game experience.   They didn't say anything worthwhile at all.  Why should I buy the Wii U?  They gave me no reason at all.  And that's especially disappointing because before this week, I was excited.  I didn't really need a whole lot of convincing.  I only needed a really great game, and I probably would've bought one.  But Pikmin 3 is not that game, and there's NOTHING else that looks interesting at all.  NOTHING.</p><p>Gamers are supposed to be excited for a new console, and there's nothing compelling or interesting.  Plus, the lineup doesn't have anything from EA or Activision.  The largest 3rd parties have no presence on this console.  So, the only games we'll ever really play on this thing are going to be from Nintendo?  It's going to be the Wii all over again.  It's a complementary console, rather than your main console.</p><p>What a waste...</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>So, anyways.  The Playstation 3 looks pretty good in the next year.  And the 3DS is starting to build a decent library.  There's plenty of other games that were shown off on the floor for these two platforms that look great such as Sound Shapes, and Unfinished Swan.  Other interesting games have been announced for the USA such as Tokyo Jungle, Code of Princess, and First of the North Star 2.  There's also Bioshock Infinite, and Ni no Kuni coming out too!</p><p>E3 was pretty disappointing but there's lots of random stuff to look forward to.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 8, 2012<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">June 2012</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/e3-2012">8</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/invisible-monsters-remix">13</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/lego-minecraft">15</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-spring-awakening-soldier-field">21</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/before-watchmen">24</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
