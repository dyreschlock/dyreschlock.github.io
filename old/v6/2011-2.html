For me, it was a 3 stage process.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 1: Disappointment</b></div><p>Isaac awoke from his bed in a medical lab somewhere and was told to get running!  Oh my, I don't remember these contols being so disorienting.  If you break the display into 3 sections, Isaac is positioned right between the left and middle sections.  Initially, this forces me to think that pushing directly up on the joystick will make Issac turn to the left slightly.  So, I try to compensate by push up and right, which make him run forward to the right.  I compensate by pulling back left, but then he doesn't move as far left I was thinking.  ugh :(</p><p>Also, Isaac was in a straight jacket the whole time, so that might be why it was so disorienting.  After an hour of running around, I was getting rather frustrated, so I put it down and went to bed.  I picked it up the next day with my expectations realigned, and ready to continue the journey.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 2: Delightment</b></div><p>Once I had become one with the controls, Dead Space's wonderful concept of immerson took center stage.  I was no longer controlling Isaac, I WAS Isaac.  Dead Space 2 is right at home with everything I loved about the first game, namely the environment and the sound.</p><div class='title'><b>The Moon!</b></div><p>While going through offices, homes, and stores in this mess of a space station or space ship or whatever, people kept referring to it as "Titan".  I figured it was just the name of the place, until I entered a room with a complete view of the outside.  It was Saturn!  The planet Saturn!  It hung so beautifully in the spacey sky.  And I realized that by "Titan", they meant the MOON!</p><p>In Dead Space 1, they just made up some planet for the Ishimura to crack.  I think it was called Aegis?  Actually, seeing how Aegis is greek, there probably is a moon with that name in our Solar System, but no where near reknowned as Titan.</p><p>The Titan moon base continued with Dead Space's theme of an organic, yet synthetic environment, ala Alien Resurrection.  And it's horrific display of gore and twisted ideals, ala Event Horizon.  Unlike the Ishimura from the first game, the Titan moon base feels much more comfortable.  Much of the environment feels dank because all the lights have been blown out and there's blood everywhere.  Before all hell broke loose, I'm sure much the locations looked a lot like Star Trek, or Mass Effect.  They just needed a fresh coat of blood to tear them down.</p><p>Now that we're running through a sustainable ecosystem, rather than an engineering vessel, there is much more variety.  You find yourself going through residential units, a mall, a church, and an elementary school, before you get to the space station stuff.</p><p>Dead Space doesn't miss the opportunity to go creepy with the elementary school.  There are now baby necromorphs and 5th grader necromorphs.  I think the 5th graders are my favorite enemy in the game.  10 or 15 of them will appear from a doorway and attempt to swarm you, while keeping their distance.</p><p>Rather than shooting them down with my gun, I always go for melee. Â It reminds me a lot of this website: <a href="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/" title="http://www.howmanyfiveyearoldscouldyoutakeinafight.com/">How many five years olds could you take in a fight?</a> The website is purely theoretical, and this was my "real life" chance to find out!  I was able to take down about 6 of 'em, before 3 more jumped on top of me and brought me down.  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/misc/statue-children.webp">Get these goddamn children off of me!</a></p><div class='title'><b>The Mood</b></div><p>Unfortunately with the amount of variety in the environment itself, sound took second place to art.  While the mood is as immersive as the first game, each area is distinct because of the environment itself, not because it sounds different.  Two of my favorite moments from Dead Space 1 were the engine room, and the first moment you hit space.</p><p>The engine room was massively loud.  The whirring of the engine completely over came my senses, and made progress a bit disorienting.  Even more so when the enemies broke into the room and I had to fight them while the huge, loud engine was right on top of me.  There is nothing like this in Dead Space 2.</p><p>The only parts in Dead Space 2 where the sound takes center stage is Space, which is completely the same as the first game.  There are several points when you are thrust into the vacuum of space to complete your task.  When this happens all sound is sucked out of the environment, and the only thing you hear is yourself.  The beeping on your oxygen tank, your breath as you exhale into your helmet, and the muddled clomps of your foot steps.</p><p>Astronauts describe the feeling of being in space as very isolating.  There is nothing between you and space, but the layer of your space suit.  Dead Space nailed this feeling perfectly, so I'm glad they brought it back for the sequel.  And now you have thrusters to fly through Space!</p><div class='title'><b>Mood Killer</b></div><p>One thing I really hate about Dead Space 2 is the use of scare tactics.  Dead Space 2 does an incredible job of immersing you in the environment and lulling you into an intent state, only to tear everything down by a monster popping out of the wall, or jumping out at you from behind a corner.  It doesn't make the game scary.  Being startled is not being scared. Â By the fourth or fifth time, I just shrug it off and blow them away. There's no sense of danger, or being spooked.</p><p>It's the difference between somewhere coming up from behind you and yelling "BOO", rather than walking through the woods at night.</p><div class='title'><b>Stage 3: Frustration</b></div><p>It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt :(</p><p>Dead Space 2 is quite an enjoyable experience until you get to the final chapters of the game.  All story points converge at the government sector of the moon base.  You've lead all the enemies of the game to this point, so now you need to fight them all.  And you have a new enemy which cannot be killed, only slowed down.</p><p>Throughout the entire game, ammunition and health had never really been a problem.  I have died quite a bit, but it was usually because I did something stupid.  Dead Space would train me not to do that, and point out it should be done this way.  I adapted and continued.  I would always have enough health packs lying around to heal me, and plenty of ammo around to keep me moving through the hordes of enemies.</p><p>In the second to last chapter, Dead Space pretty much gave up on this balance.  The enemies were more difficult, and there were more of them.  I started using a whole lot of ammunition taking them down without enough to return to take on the next wave.  So, I started getting hit more, and using up my health packs.  Wave after wave of enemies continued, and I no longer had health to regen.</p><p>I basically pushed and shoved my way through all the enemies to make progress, which resulted in many many lives, and many many restarts.  Yes, I wasn't really thinking about how I could improve, but with constant failure, I just wanted to get it done.  I finally made it to the final checkout, which was complete with a Store to resupply.</p><p>What awaited behind that checkout was another constant horde of enemies, I had to push through to get to the final boss.  But when I made it, I was all out of ammo and health again.  Basically fucked.  I tried taking them down, but after 30 minutes, I quit.</p><div class='title'><b>The End</b></div><p>With a good night's rest to think about my options, I returned with a plan.  I sold all my extra ammo and focused completely on the only gun I had completely leveled up, my Plasma Cutter.  With my strategy realigned, I tore through the horde, pushing most of them aside to greet the final boss, again.  This time I blasted the shit of them.  They hardly stood a chance.</p><p>Overall, Dead Space 2 did not let me down.  I feel like it had a few incredible scenes and sequences, sewn together by a solid base.  Before I got to the end, I had a very enjoyable time, and I'll probably pick it up again to chew away at the remaining achievements.</p><p>I would totally recommend Dead Space 2 for anyone that has fond memories of the original.</p><p>Also, the legend continues (or begins) with Dead Space Extraction included on the disc!  Plus, there is DLC releasing tomorrow that ties Extraction into Dead Space 2, entitled "Severed".<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on February 28, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">February 26, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Protest! (Day 12)</h3><p>Today is Friday, and I grabbed a few more pictures after work.  There were many protesters right outside Walker's office banging on their drums during his press conference.  And there were plenty of protestors in the center of the rotunda riling up the crowd.</p><p>The Capitol has changed quite a bit over the past week.  People have started calling this place home.  There are family areas, food areas, and even a lending library.  Sleeping bags and mattresses line the walls on the upper levels.  And the noise level has calmed down quite a bit from the massive high energy yells of the crowd, to a somber rhythmic pounding of drums.</p><p>I feel like much of today is holding off, and building up support for the massive demostrations planned for tomorrow.  I've been invited to so many facebook events for rallies starting at Noon on Saturday.</p><p>Anywho...  pictures!</p><p class='img'><img

(Day 9)</h3><p>Much like yesterday, I stopped by the Capitol after work today.  I got there to catch the tail end of the 5pm Rally.  It ended around 10 minutes to 6pm, which was when Scott Walker addressed the state in a "fireside chat".  Everyone from the Rally poored into the Capitol and began chanting right outside his door to make the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">live</span> address as difficult as possible.</p><p>Pictures!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0618.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0618.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0618.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0621.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0621.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0621.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0622_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0622_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0622_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Directly ahead, several monitors are setup to watch Wisconsin Eye as they broadcast everything going on behind closed doors.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0646_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0646_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0646_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0662.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0662.webp"  /></p><p>Everyone gathers directly outside Walker's office to disrupt his address</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0679_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0679_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0679_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>The Governor's office is straight ahead.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0702.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0702.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110222_protest/IMG_0702.webp"  /></p><p>I am having WAYYY too much fun taking photos and dumping them into Microsoft ICE to create those panaramic and fisheye photos.

But the entire is going just as strong as it has all last week.  Today's weather was just as bad, but it brought a well needed energetic boost with a supportive concert courtey of Tom Morello of Rage against the Machine.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0536.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0536.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0536.webp"  /></p><p>The concert started off with several speakers whipping the crowd into a frenzy for about 45 minutes.  Tom Morello took the stage and stating why he throws his support behind the unions of Wisconsin.  And then a bunch of musicians took the stage and started singing.  After 45 minutes of acoustic guitar cover songs, we had had enough, and left.</p><p>Actually, I did enjoy the Street Dogs' first song.  The Street Dogs are a band with lead singer Mike McColgan, who used to be the lead singer of Dropkick Murphy.  Their first song was something they wrote specifically for the event, and had the same Irish enthusiasm you'd expect from the Dropkick Murphys.  It was called "Up for unions" or something like that.</p><p>Anyways, we left for the Capitol.  Most of the people were at the concert, but there were still a bunch of people fighting the good fight.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0565.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0565.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0566_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0566_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0566_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0579_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0579_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0579_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0596.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0594.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0594.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0594.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0595.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0595.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0595.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0597.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0597.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110221_protest/IMG_0597.webp"  /></p><p>Tomorrow is a big day, as they plan on actually voting for the bill, or passing through some legislative parts of it, or something.

on his blog.  It is entitled "Destroyed", and it compliments a book release for Moby, also entitled "Destroyed".  The book features a collection of photographs he has captured over his years of photography.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/WZxhn.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/WZxhn.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/WZxhn.webp"  /></p><p>The album and the book are slated for release in mid-May 2011.</p><p>BUT TODAY! You can download an EP of "Be The One" which includes 3 tracks from "Destroyed", including "Be The One", "Sevastopol", and "Victoria Lucas".  So far the album sounds amazing.  The EP really returns to Moby's core sound featured in his albums Play and 18.  I love it.  I can't wait to here the whole thing. ^_^</p><p>Also, he mentioned with the release of "Destroyed" he has a lot of live shows planned between May and September.  Hopefully he'll make it through the Midwest!</p><p>Take a look at moby dot com for more information<br/><a href="http://www.moby.com/" title="http://www.moby.com/">http://www.moby.com/</a></p><p>Here's his announcement of the album<br/><a href="http://www.moby.com/journal/2011-02-15/destroyed.html" title="http://www.moby.com/journal/2011-02-15/destroyed.html">http://www.moby.com/journal/2011-02-15/destroyed.html</a><br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on February 15, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">February 13, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Spring 2011 Musical Events</h3><p>Much like every year, once the brutal winter months of December and January have passed, musicians feel like they can brave our environment and deliver some fantastic entertainment we've been deprived of for the past few months.  And this coming Spring music season has a massive lineup of talent coming through Madison that I haven't really seen before.</p><p>Here's a list of upcoming events that I plan on attending:</p><p>Fri 2/18 - <b>Phaded </b>@ Mirimar, Milwaukee<br/>Tue 2/22 - <b>Skrillex </b>@ Majestic, Madison<br/>[Fri 2/25 - <b>The New Deal</b>, <b>Nero</b>, <b>Conspirator</b> @ Congress, Chicago]<br/>[Sat 2/26 - <b>Marcus Schulz</b> @ Vision, Chicago]<br/>[Sun 2/27 - <b>Conspirator </b>@ Majestic, Madison]<br/>Sat 3/5 - <b>Designer Drugs</b> @ Majestic, Madison<br/>[Sat 3/12 - <b>Crystal Castles</b> @ Rivera, Chicago]<br/>Sat 3/12 - <b>Sasha </b>@ The Mid, Chicago<br/>Fri 3/18 - <b>OTT </b>@ Majestic, Madison<br/>Wed 3/23 - <b>John Digweed</b> @ The Mid, Chicago<br/>Fri 4/8 - <b>Bassnectar</b>, <b>Eskmo </b>@ Orpheum, Madison<br/>Fri 4/15 - <b>Anamanaguchi </b>@ Turf Club, St. Paul<br/>Fri 4/15 - <b>Wolfgang Gartner</b> @ Epic, Minneapolis<br/>Thu 4/21 - <b>Rusko </b>@ Orpheum, Madison<br/>Fri 4/22 - <b>Heyoka</b> @ Miramar, Milwaukee<br/>Tue 4/26 - <b>Shpongle </b>@ Majestic, Madison<br/>Sat 5/7 - <b>Beats Antique</b> @ Majestic, Madison</p><p>And there's plenty of other events coming through that I can't attend.

It's too bad I won't be able to attend this year.  But there's plenty of stuff going on in the midwest to keep me busy.</p><p>If I were going to PAX East, these are the panels I would definitely want to attend:</p><p><b>1UP Presents: Retronauts Vs. 16 Bits</b> - Friday @ 3pm<br/>Live recording of 1up's defunct Retronauts podcast including panelists Jeremy Parish, Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi.  Though, they will most likely record this panel and release it on 1up.com, so missing this panel won't hurt.  I ususally never go anyway.</p><p><b>From Background To Center Stage: Building Game Worlds As Main Characters</b> - Friday @ 5pm<br/>A panel including Irrational Games members Ken Levine and Shawn Elliot, headed by Julian Murdoch.  Plenty of Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite matters included...</p><p><b>Inside Game Localization</b> - Friday @ 8pm<br/>Including the leads at Kajiya Productions as they discuss localizing Final Fantasy 12 and Tactics Ogre, among other things.</p><p><b>PAX East Chiptune Showcase</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>Zen Albatross hosts an event with some of the best chip artists from the east coast including Sabrepulse, Br1ght Pr1mate, and himself.</p><p><b>Owned but Independent</b> - Saturday @ 11am<br/>At the same time, a panel including Brian Raffel and Eric Biessman of local Madison game studio, Raven, discuss what it's like to be "owned" by Activision.  Even though, I would end up going to the Chiptune panel, it'd be nice to support local game development. ^_^</p><p><b>Videogame Antiques Roadshow</b> - Saturday @ 6:30pm<br/>A panel including Chris Kohler and Frank Cifaldi discuss game collecting and finding value in old games.</p><p><b>Making the "Citizen Kane" of Poker Games</b> - Sunday @ 3pm<br/>Idle Thumbs alert.  Sean Vanaman, Jake Rodkin and other Telltale Games members speak about the development of Poker Night at the Inventory.</p><p>These are all the ones that really popped out at me.  There's also the really high attendance panels such as the Penny Arcade panels, and everything in the main room, but I usually skip those.  I've attended enough of those in the past that I would know what to expect and there's plenty of other things that would keep me busy.</p><p>But yeah, I'm skipping PAX East this year. Â I plan on attending PAX Normal, as I do each year, so you can catch me there.</p><p>Here's the link to the full panel schedule: <a href="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php" title="http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php">http://east.paxsite.com/schedule.php</a><br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on February 13, 2011<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">February 2011</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/spring-2011-musical-events">13</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/moby-announces-new-album">15</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/protest-day-4">17</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/protest-concert-day-8">21</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/protest-day-9">23</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/protest-day-12">26</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/dead-space-2">28</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
