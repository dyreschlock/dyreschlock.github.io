class="title">Schlock for Sale</h3><p>The other day, I finally got around to selling some of my stuff.  I've had this long-time ambition to rid myself of possessions I no longer need, but I was short on motivation.  I attempted this a few times, but became overwhelmed with the flurry of options.  eBay didn't seem permanent enough, Craigslist is still foreign to me and CAG is still to infantile.  I choose to go with <a href="http://half.com" title="http://half.com">Half.com</a> since it's listing are permanent, get a fair amount of traffic, and everything works like a store. ^_^</p><p>On Sunday (or Monday), I listed 23 items, but for some reason...  it didn't update.  I waited an hour... nothing.  I waited a few more hours... nothing.  I checked their forums and apparently they've been having servers problems and were incredibly back logged.  I continued to wait.  The next day... nothing.  The next day...  nothing.  Yesterday...  nothing.</p><p>Finally, this morning I got an email.  "Your item has been sold!"  Splendid!  I checked my account and all my items had finally appeared in the system.  Only a few hours after being live and I already sold something!  By the end of the work day, another had sold!</p><p>Have a look for yourself.  <b>Here's my <a href="http://shops.half.ebay.com/dyreschlock_W0QQ" title="http://shops.half.ebay.com/dyreschlock_W0QQ">Half.com Shop</a></b>.</p><p>Listing items is far simpler than eBay and doesn't cost anything to list!  You just enter in your item, assign a price and up it goes.  When someone buys one of my games, the money goes into my half.com account and then pays out twice a month to my back account.  Pretty spiffy.</p><p>So far, I've sold Final Fantasy XI and Ar Tonelico.  Final Fantasy XI sold for $10 and Ar Tonelico sold for $50, both at a $10 profit to myself. ^_^  In fact, the $40 price tag is still on Ar Tonelico.  hahah</p><p>Anywho...  so this is what I have listed so far:</p><p class='img'><img

My eyes, my hands and my head is pretty engaged with what is going on, but my ears only get to do something when talking with coworkers.  So I listen to a lot of music and podcasts.  Usually back and forth between the two, rather than a mix.  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for music.  Sometimes, I'm in the mood for talking and chatter.  My job goes back and forth between planning and execution constantly, so it's a great way to keep the boring execution phase of my job lively.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/GFW-2.webp" /></p><p>My favorite podcast shuts down its doors today, and that is the Brodeo aka GFWRadio formerly CGWRadio.  The Brodeo starred the editors of Games For Windows Magazine formerly Computer Gaming World, who were Jeff Green, Ryan Scott, Shawn Elliot and Sean Malloy with Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos.</p><p>CGWRadio began on February 16th, 2006.  The first couple episodes were a little odd, but they eventually figured it out.  On August 8th, 2006, they announced that CGW would become GFW and in November launched their first issue.</p><p>GFWRadio combined a unique brand of gaming humor with the trials and annoyances of working in the gaming journalism business and the joy of being in the business.</p><div class='title'><b>Content</b></div><p>After listening to GFWRadio, I never thought I'd have such an insight into the gaming media.  This type of perspective is something that I never even thought about 4 years ago being a gamer.  4 years ago, I was still writing about games, but I never had the insight as to what the game's designers were thinking about, what the publishers were doing to promote the game, and what really went into making the game to begin with.  I know so much more now-a-days about the pressures these publishing companies put on game reviews and journalists on exactly what they say about a game.</p><p>They also talked a lot about the themes in games and what the game really meant to them and wouldn't pull any punches.  They'd give you their complete honesty opinion on what the game did right and what the game did wrong.  They'd also completely deconstruct some games talking about character interaction, plot devices and themes.</p><p>Discussions on GFWRadio were a good balance between these industry related topics, and high-brow video game analysis, but weren't afraid to go completely low-brow too and talk about stupid things they do or have done.  It's really just a bunch of guys bullshitting about their jobs, lives and games they play.</p><p>That's really where the term <b>Brodeo</b> came from.  Jeff Green was browsing around Urban Dictionary and found this definition: <em>A get-together or a party where the attendance is predominantly male.</em>  He brought it up on the podcast and the cult following of GFWRadio labeled it as such.</p><p>The real humor of the show came from "Hero's of the Web", Dramatic Readings, Stories of griefing and gaming, and other coined terms, segments and jokes that became running gags.</p><div class='title'><b>Ending</b></div><p>April 8th, 2008 marked the beginning of the end as Ziff Davis put a hard start to Games For Windows Magazine.  Actually, I suppose, Ziff Davis declaring bankruptcy was really the beginning of the end.  But shifting from a print magazine to the online space wasn't really something the GFW editors had been prepared for.</p><p>I wish I would've evangelized this podcast more when it was in its prime, but oh well.  Popularity is not the reason it's ending.  It's ending because the key voices of the show have now gone on to do bigger and better things.</p><p>In June, Sean Malloy announced that he had gotten a job for Blizzard and left 1up.  Last week, Jeff Green recorded his final podcast and he left to work on the Sims with Maxis and EA.  And this week, Shawn Elliot finishes up the Brodeo and heads off to 2K Boston to work with Ken Levine (creator of Bioshock) on his next project.</p><p>Ryan Scott, Robert Ashley and Anthony Gallegos are still at 1up and have said that they'll continue to podcast in some form or do something, but the actual Brodeo, has ended.</p><p>Times change.  Jobs change.  People grow up.  You complete college, you gotta move on.  You get your first job or your break in the Industry.  You usually start at the same place many other begin as well.  Eventually, you gotta move up in the Industry.  So that's basically it.</p><p>A lot of voices have moved on from 1up, but there's plenty of new voices as well.  With the Brodeo gone, I think I'll turn my attention to 1up FM, 1up's new podcast.</p><p>My hope is for a GFW Reunion at PAX 2009. ^_^  It was neat meeting Shawn Elliot at PAX, but I really didn't get to say too much to him.</p><div class='title'><b>Errata</b></div><p

Alloy which is the base material for creating the Terminator Endo-skeletons.  The mission was to gather this stuff, bring it to this specific location and await further instructions.  The Terminator completely this mission and stood by the door awaiting further instructions.  His wait instructions was something like this...<br/><pre>while(door not open && not interrupted) {    wait(15000); }</pre><br/>Honestly, no one would really be coming to this specific location until after the machine war broke out.  So the Terminator would be completely standing still there for 5 straight years.  That's computer logic for ya.</p><div class='title'><b>Time Travel Semantics</b></div><p>Traveling through time in the Terminator Universe will transport to a different time, but you'll be in the exact same position on earth.  I guess that makes sense.  That's also how it works in Back to the Future and other time traveling movies.  It doesn't work that way in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure though.</p><div class='title'><b>Survival Instincts</b></div><p>In the first episode, they "destroy" the evil Terminator and travel in the future 8 years.  But, what d'ya know, the Terminator actually survived, but has been beat to shit.  The Terminator lies in pieces around the scene at which he thought he killed Sarah and John Connor, but they really went into the future.  8 years later, they appear and the Terminator gets a second wind.</p><p>This Terminator, whom they've named Cromartie, has had its head blown off and flesh completely rotted away.  So he must find his head, but still blend in with humans.  He finds his head, but must create a new skin for himself.  So he finds some scientist and gives him the formula to create the skin.  So now he has skin, but he looks like the Toxic Avenger.  So, he finds a reconstructive surgeon to make him look like an actual person.</p><p>Rather than just going directly after John Connor, Cromartie is rebuilding himself and camouflages himself to accomplish his mission.  He realizes his limitations and must adapt.  I wonder if this is what the Terminators in the future realized after some time fighting the humans.  You can't win head on.  You need to deceive to conquer.  And even then it doesn't really work all that well.<br/>____</p><p>Anyways, I'm excited to see how the first season ends.  Though, I'll probably be dissappointed.  I keep forgetting that the whole Terminator mythos is one that puts Action first, and other things second.  Hopefully, they'll keep building up the mythos with these little tidbits rather than trying to make "awesome" action sequences.</p><p>We'll see though...  The second season has already begun!</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 17,

giving it much thought.  I found it at the first place I went to!  But after researching it a little bit, it seems they released a Limited Edition version.  I'm not quite sure why I didn't realize this since nearly every Global Underground release has a Limited Edition.  Buying it from Amazon was quite easy.  They had plenty.</p><p>Besides the nifty packaging, it also included a second CD with extra tracks and remixes, so that was reason enough to make the purchase.</p><p>Over the weekend, I went out to Milwaukee with Dave and hung out with Matt and Dan.  I popped Involver 2 into Dave's car and we listened to it quite a bit.  It's interesting how the CD takes a completely different form when the bass is the prominent sound.  Not saying that Dave has the most kickass sound system, but the Bass really takes on a melody of its own.</p><p>Man...  It really puts me in the mood to see him live again.  Or Digweed for that matter.  Digweed is a virtuoso of progressive pounding Bass.</p><p>Luckily, <b>Sasha has a free mix on his <a href="http://djsasha.com/fr.php" title="http://djsasha.com/fr.php">website</a>, which you can download directly from <a href="http://www.djsasha.com/Thank_You_Mix_2008.zip" title="http://www.djsasha.com/Thank_You_Mix_2008.zip">here</a></b>.  It's his "Thanks" to his fans.  It's amazing how very very Digweed this mix sounds.  I wonder if his Sasha+Digweed reunion tour earlier this year really inspired him to pull into a deep progressive direction.</p><p>Like every new piece of music, I listen to it over and over again at work until I get sick of it.  I think I listened to it 3 times today...</p><p>When I returned from Milwaukee, I came to find that I had received my LE copy of Involver 2.  Here it is:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2028.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2028.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2028.webp" /></p><p>It comes in a nifty little pamphlet.  It's a little different than the first Involver LE which came in a pillow-pack.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2029.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2029.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080917_involver/IMG_2029.webp" /></p><p>The second disc of Involver 2 is neat, but quite unloved.  The care and attention that was put into the album as a whole was lost on this extras disc, but I guess that's to be expected.  Each song is very chill, even compared to the opening of Involver 2.  I only listened to it once though.  It didn't hold my attention the same way the actual Involver 2 does.</p><p>I'm excited again for Sasha after hearing his recent stuff.  During his Fundacion phase, I was starting to feel unmoved by his music.  I was starting to wait for what he had next, rather than not wanting it to end.  In fact, I missed him once or twice as he passed through the midwest and really didn't care.  But now I can't wait for him to get back here.  Hell, if he's in or around Tampa, I'd go visit Justin and make him bring me there. ^_^</p><p>Good Stuff.</p><a name="more"></a><span

music very well.</p><div class='title'><b>Ago</b></div><p>Over 4 years ago, I was going crazy when I heard the news about Sasha and Global Underground teaming to bring something new to the Electronic music scene.  The hype leading up to Involver was overwhelming for me.  I actually found the entire album on some torrent site, downloaded it, and listened to it constantly.  I loved every second of it.</p><p>It was very much the soundtrack to the Summer of 2004 for me.  I listened to it while driving from Minneapolis down to Chicago to see Sasha at Soundbar for his North American tour (<a href="/old/v6/sasha-soundbar-chicago" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago">pics</a>).  I listened to it while in Cleveland, Ohio driving around with Justin, waiting for Josh to get married.  I listened to it nearly every day driving back and forth to work at the Pharmacy.  Ah Memories...</p><p>That's in stark contrast to today where I didn't even realize Invol2ver existed until I saw some forum post on hybridized 2 days after Invol2ver was released.  If I knew about, I probably would've been going crazy.  But oh well.  Later that day, I found Invol2ver quite easily at B-side Records on State St. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>Invol2ver is very much in the same theme as Involver, but has a slightly different feel that I couldn't quite put my finger on.  Involver was a summer diary for Sasha.  Each track signified a moment or a sound that he shopped around to each venue he visited from the months prior. He selected his favorite tracks, tore them completely apart and put them back together.  His work on Involver was much more than a simple remix.  It was really a reconstruction like a full-on production album.</p><p>Before reading about and catching up on Sasha, I didn't really feel like Invol2ver really lived up to the Involver name.  Some of the tracks felt very mute.  I didn't quite understand what the point was, or what these tracks meant.  The beginning just melted itself into something like Fundacion with little hints of Airdrawndagger.  The album did, eventually, pull itself into the Sasha Involver style.</p><p>For some reason, the little booklet didn't have any description or proof of concept like the first Involver.  But Global Underground had the description I was looking for.  And reminded me of what Sasha was up to lately.</p><div class='title'><b>Two Halves</b></div><p>The first half of Invol2ver is a diary of his emFire Collection.  It's very chill and nature.  The emFire collection is a soundtrack to a bunch of surfer videos.  But it eventually builds into his DJ experiences as of late.  The second half and ending brings me back to how I felt when I first heard Involver.  Very distinct melodies built off the underlying bass and movement.</p><p>Overall, I think Invol2ver accomplishes its goals, but the 2 different feelings of the emFire collection and his DJ experiences clash quite heavily.</p><p>For a mix album, it may have been better to have the Day and Night cycles on two separate discs, rather than mixing into each other.  It does form a story though.  Starting from daylight, at the beach, then watching the sun set on Miami, and then going to a club and dancing into the late night.</p><p>I guess that's why the 2 is smack dab in the middle of the title.  Invol2ver.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p>It's unfortunate that Sasha isn't touring in the midwest for his Invol2ver North American tour.  I'd really like to see what his set says about his CD release.  Though, I suppose for June 2004 it was very much in the style of Fundacion than Involver, so his North American might not say much of anything.</p><p>I saw him back in April 2008 for his Spring Tour with John Digweed, but I'm not sure when I saw Sasha before that.  His style has become very undistinct for me lately and June 2004 was the beginning.</p><p>The ending of Involver 1 really felt like this was the direction he was going.  The final song just trailed off into the distance.  But the ending of Invol2ver put a very distinct cap on the album.  I'd like to see if this means anything. ^_^</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 12, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 5, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Windows XP lied to me</h3><p>This morning, I decided to come into work a little early.  A couple of months ago, I got some new RAM for my computer, but I had been too lazy to actually install it on my computer.  So today was the day.  Today I'll finally do this.</p><p>A quick look at my computer specs revealed that I had 3gb of RAM installed in 4 slots.  Using my simple logic, 2 of those sticks in my machine must be 512mb and using simple addition, I can deduce that 1 + 1 + .5 + .5 = 3gb.  The new RAM that has been sitting in its shipping box on my desk contained two sticks of 1gb each!  Using addition again, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4gb!  Fantastic.</p><p>Even though, I had just gotten a new computer here at work, I should probably upgrade the old like I was supposed to a while ago.  I turned it off, removed the side panel, and began to hunt for the 512 sticks.  The first one I removed said 1gb.  Okay, that's not it.  The next one...  also, 1gb.  Okay, so the first two were the big ones.  The next one...  1gb.  Huh?  The next one... 1gb.  Hmmm...  I already have 4gb of RAM.</p><p>I put the computer back together, loaded up windows xp and looked at the computer specs again...  3gb RAM.  What the hell?!  Something didn't add up.</p><p>So, I asked someone about it.  Someone who knew what they were doing.  Looking at the Bios revealed that 4gb were registered.</p><p>They way memory is viewed in Windows XP is the amount allocated to Windows XP.  Other hardware on my computer were using the top addressed memory for their own purposes.  Hardware like the video card.  Apparently, when you buy a video card with 512mb of memory, it's not something additional that gets tacked on to your system.  It's the capacity of the memory that it takes from your onboard memory.  Whatever is left after all your hardware takes their share is left for the OS.</p><p>Windows XP lies about the memory you have.  It only tells you what memory it has.</p><p>Windows Vista, on the other hand, does not.  On my new computer, I only have 1gb of RAM (for the moment) and Vista clearly says 1gb in the computer specs.  The little memory gauge will allows be the absolute correct amount of memory eaten up by everything using it.</p><p>That's somewhat interesting, though...  I didn't know video card memory worked that way.</p><a

Impressions</h3><p>Bioware, creators of Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect, had a spiffy booth that always had a big line wrapping around the edges.  Inside, you could see a demo of Dragon Age, which I really know nothing about.</p><p>I did watch a little bit of the demo in the Main Theater, before Spore, though.  But what they demoed on the screen was a tool set to create whatever you want in the game.  This allows them to customize or create any NPC from appearance to dialogue and even down to specific quests and all the details of the quest.  Thus making the world of Dragon Age absolutely customizable and as massive as they'd like.</p><p>They didn't show any of the story though, which is really what I'd want from an RPG.  Especially after playing Mass Effect, I'd love another Bioware RPG with a solid premise and story with solid characters to bring you through it.  Medievil times bores me, though, and I wasn't really interested in this game from the start.</p><p>I'm not really sure why I wrote this.  I want Mass Effect 2.  Or at least some more Mass Effect DLC.  OR at least another stupid Mass Effect novel.</p><a name="more"></a><span

3 and Left 4 Dead tied as having the longest lines of the show.  Left 4 Dead is by Valve Software.  It's a 4 player co-operative game in which you play 4 people surviving an onslaught of zombies.  These are boring stupid zombies either.  These are fast lethal fuckers out for blood.</p><p>There was constantly a horde of people lined up in a queue on booth sides of the kiosk.  One headed to the 4 PCs set up.  The other headed to the 4 Xboxes set up.  Lines for PC versus Xbox were about equal.</p><p>This is really where the hardcore video game enthusiasts came to play.  Everyone was yelling at each other what they were doing, working together to fight off the zombies.  Left 4 Dead had the most interaction out of any game on the floor and everyone I saw walk away from the demo had a smile on their face.  Players laughed.  Players cheered.  Players shouted their victories.</p><p>Left 4 Dead definitely feels like the feel good game of this holiday season.</p><a name="more"></a><span

nearly everywhere you looked you could find a PC game.  If I had to choose which platform had the most diversity on the exhibition floor, I think it would be PC.  Also, If I had to choose which platform had the longest lines and the biggest games, I think it would also be PC.   Especially, the Blizzard booth.</p><p>Thankfully, each kiosk had two screens: one raised high enough for everyone to see, and another at the player level.  All the Starcraft II kiosks were linked together, and everyone battled against each other.</p><p>There's not really much to say about Starcraft II though.  It's...  Starcraft II.  Starcraft with updated graphics and game control.  It's looks super pretty, too.</p><p>Of course, games of Starcraft II take a little time to play through, so that made the lines grow and grow.  They started installing Starcraft II on some of the Lich King kiosks so everyone could play. Hahah. ^_^</p><p>I'm not really sure why you'd really want World of Warcraft: Wraith of the Lich King on a playable kiosk, anyways.  All you'd really want to show off is the Death Knight and some of the new areas.  For a little while, I watched one guy play and he was a Gnome Warrior running around...  What a waste of time.  They did have some demonstrations of Lich King, though, so it wasn't all a waste.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 1, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 1, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">PAX: Spore Impressions</h3><p>Watching Spore in action was pretty neat.  I picked up the Sport Creature Creator a month ago, but I got kinda bored with it.  It takes actual effort to make a neat lookin' character and I'm rather lazy when it comes to that.</p><p>The Creature Creator was really just a way for Maxis to fill the universe with all this user generated content.  The demonstrator showed off some really pretty aliens too.  There was a Land Octopus and a Yoda.  Incredibly detailed.</p><p>The creature you actually play in the game is completely customizable every time you're birthed.  In the beginning, you're a little amoeba guy and you run around and eat stuff.  You'll gain evolution points and also find body parts too.  You can find a mate, if you'd like and then you'll create a child.  You'll play as this child, but can re-custom it anyway you'd like before actually moving around again.</p><p>In the amoeba stage, you keep eating and grow and grow.  Eventually, you'll be able to walk on land.  Then you do the same thing.  Run around, eat stuff, make babies, evolve.</p><p>The next stage is tribal.  Now you've started to build a community with your creatures and can control multiple creatures at the same time.  It takes teamwork to kill creatures, and fetch food to feed the entire tribe.  The tribal stage ends when you've either befriended a rival tribe, or killed them to extinction.</p><p>Then you've got the city stage where you control populations.  Then you've got the space stage where you explore and conquer the universe.</p><p>Throughout the game your decisions will decide whether you're more of a violent attacking species, or a peaceful society.  Either way is fine!  It's how you want to evolve.</p><p>Watching one of the producers run through the beginning of the game was pretty eye opening how the evolution process of Spore gives legacy to all of your actions.  If you're a peaceful race, you've probably evolved from Herbivore in the primordial stages.  Are you aggressive?  Perhaps you killed and eaten your prey in the beginning.</p><p>Despite all the hype and the backlash and the re-hype, I'm still pretty excited for Spore.  It's only a week away!  Hopefully my Desktop computer with Vista won't hassle the installer.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 1, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 1, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">PAX: Mortal Kombat v. DC Hands On</h3><p>While wondering around, Five and I came across the Midway booth, which had several kiosks of Mortal Kombat v. DC ready for play.  Each game had 10 playable characters: 5 MK characters and 5 DC characters.  On the Mortal Kombat side, you could fight as Scorpion, Subzero, Shang Tsung, Kitana, and...  someone else.  Maybe Liu Kang.  For DC, you could choose Superman, Batman, Cat Woman, The Flash or The Joker.</p><p>Nearly everyone playing choose a DC character.  That makes sense though.  The DC characters are new to the franchise, whereas Scorpion and Subzero have been there since the beginning.  We want to try out new things, rather than simply win the fight.</p><p>I was tempted to choose Superman, but I fought as The Flash since he seemed more my style of fighting character.  Fast quick flurry of moves, and ease of getting into combat and fleeing quickly.  Five choose Kitana, who no one really used at all.  Equal Opportunity!</p><p>After a heated awkward battle, I barely won after learning a neat move or two.</p><p>There really isn't much to say about MK v. DC other than, yes, it <i>is</i> definitely Mortal Kombat.  When fighting as The Flash, it felt like another move-set for an MK character, but with Superhero-like moves.  I think they did a great job pulling the DC Superheroes into the Mortal Kombat universe...  other than the exception that any character can defeat Superman.  I think that's bullshit, but you can't have a DC game without Superman.  Oh well.</p><p>Anyways, it was pretty fun. ^_^  Once again, it reminds me of playing fighting games back at the SPAMM haus.  There were those couple of months we played Mortal Kombat V on the Gamecube.  It'll make a great addition to any circle of friend's nightly gaming session.  But, for me, I think I'll stick with Soul Caliber IV.  Mortal Kombat does not compare to the depth and artistic quality of Soul Caliber.<br/>____</p><p>It should be noted that Mortal Kombat v. DC will be released for Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 sometime this fall.  Gamefaqs says mid-November.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 1,

meaning over the weekend.</p><p>On Saturday, Jess bought Castle Crashers at the Newsgrounds booth for Ace.  We were kinda tired throughout the day, so we got back to their place around 10:30pm and decided to play it!  Unfortunately, we could only find 2 controllers and a quick drive around the neighbor revealed that all the stores that carried 360 controllers were closed for the night.  drat.</p><p>That first night, Ace and I defended our castle and began our journey to rescue the princesses.  Every new environment, new enemy and new pet we came across was followed laughter and constant giggling and chuckling.  The comedy and art style of Castle Crashers is infectious.  Half the time we literally died from laughing too hard and not paying attention.</p><p>Castle Crashers is a very High Definition flash game released for the Xbox Live Arcade.  It is a 4 player arcade style beat 'em up game much like TMNT,  Simpsons...  all those old 4 player Konami arcade games.  Castle Crashers has a leveling system though.  You're always building up your character to get further, rather than putting in quarter after quarter.  You also find new weapons and pets with varying stats and effects to help you kill everything.</p><p>After an hour or two, I was just too tired to continue.  Ace and Five didn't play a whole lot further.  The next day at PAX, I made sure to stop by the Newsgrounds booth and purchase a copy direct from the creators. ^_^.  After PAX and after a delicious dinner, we got back in their neighborhood around 9pm.  Well enough time to buy a Pink controller, and wage war 3 player style.</p><p>Ace, Five and I laid waste to everyone that came in our path and finally rescued the fourth princess around 1am.  Victory!</p><p>Though, our victory was short lived as our flights the next morning were at 5:45 and 6:01.  I needed sleep though, so I crashed and was woken up around 4:30.  We finally left the house and got to the airport around 5:15.  I was presented with a very long line at the United check-in, which resulted in missing my intended flight.  Fortunately, I was able to catch the next flight 2 hours later and still get back to Madison around 4pm today.  Victory!</p><p>Anywho, I was somewhat surprised we beat Castle Crashers.  But the journey to that goal was what made the entire experience worth while.  Teamwork!  Slashing enemies, dodging attacks, reviving teammates.  Helping out each other when needed.</p><p>Man, I need to do some more social gaming.  This weekend has really reminded me of this entire aspect of gaming that is obviously there, but have just completely ignored over the past year or so.  The extent of my socializing with games is just talking about single player experiences.</p><p>Thinking back on it, I guess Castle Crashers is rather short, but there are plenty of unlockable characters to replay through the game and various hidden weapons and pets that are tough to find.  I'll definitely play through the game with whoever has it out there. ^_^</p><p>Go Blue Knight!</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 1, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 1,

series and I don't really care about Betheseda either.  Justin is totally hyped for the game though, so I wanted to see if there was more to this game that I was missing.</p><p>Fallout 3 had a huge presence at PAX this year.  From the completely filled up live demo, to the huge crowds piled around the kiosk in the exhibition hall.  So, It was rather easy to see it for myself.  Though, I didn't actually play the game, I think I have a pretty good idea of what to expect from it now.</p><p>Betheseda's goal was to bring the Oblivion like experience to the Fallout series.  But I don't think anyone knew how literal they were being.  The game IS Oblivion, except with a Mad Max skin over the top, and a 1950s like theme fitting in with the old games.</p><p>Fallout 3 feels like a hand-me-down.  "Well Oblivion did really well.  Let's just polish up the engine and buy a franchise to put on top of it."  It's almost comical that Fallout 3 begins in roughly the same way Oblivion did.  In Oblivion, you break out of prison and get blown away by the massive lush world outside, a stark difference of environment.  In Fallout, you braek out of your nuke vault and get blown away by the massive scared dirt work outside.  Then you kill some rats.</p><p>Though, I did have some fun with Oblivion for the first couple of hours.  But the experience ultimately failed from the thin string of a story and boring useless quests that I couldn't care less about.</p><p>Fallout has the neat zooming targeting system, but you're still just grinding for some level or some quest.  It's probably a game I could get into, but I don't really want to.  It's another title for my gamefly list.<br/>___</p><p>It should be noted that Fallout 3 will be available on Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and

series.  We went to the Wipeout Fusion website daily prior to the launch of the game.  The interface design and background music painted a picture of what surely was to come.</p><p>Wipeout 3 was such a treasure, and Wipeout Fusion was a sad mess.  Our hearts were crushed, but my resilience bled through.  I still played the crap out of that game, but I was sad it lost its community.  Fzero GX picked up all the stragglers.</p><p>Even though Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse are supposed to be quality products, I really didn't want to buy a PSP to play them.  And now that I own a PSP, I really don't have the ambition to play them.  The handheld realm doesn't feel like a good fit.  It doesn't feel like Wipeout to me.</p><p>Wipeout HD reclaims all my feelings of the past and displays them in beautiful harmony on screen.  I was already resolved to buying it, Day One, but my level of excitement has jumped after getting my hands on it.</p><p>Fantastic.<br/>___</p><p>It should be noted that

I wrote a little bit about this before (<a href="/old/v6/free-running-game" title="/free-running-game">here</a>), but it's a free-running game where you leap and bound twixed rooftops and inside buildings.  They had the exact same demo I've seen about a thousand times, but I decided to stand in line and actually feel the controls for myself.</p><p>And it played exactly like you think it would.  Running around is pretty intuitive and fun.  It's not as easy as it looks, but it's not really difficult.  The challenge of the game will be figuring out where to go.  Once you've got that down, each level will have a time trial and leaderboards.</p><p>Playing Mirror's Edge was exactly how I expected it to be, but I'm still skeptical on the length of the game.  We asked the demoer a few times about the length of the game, and he could not comment.  Which means its probably not more than 10 hours long.  There's plenty of replay in the time trials though.  But still, Portal had a bunch of replay, but was still only a 3 hour game.</p><p>I think this game will lend itself well to a rental.  But since I've already preordered it, and it IS fun...  I think my $60 will be well spent.<br/>___</p><p>It should be noted that Mirror's Edge comes out November 11th for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC platform.

Dead Space is a bit of an anomaly as I really can't explain why I'm so excited.</p><p>The story is pretty standard.  The crew aboard the mining ship US Ishimura has been invaded by monsters or something.  The monsters have eaten and mutilated the crew into monsters themselves.  You play Isaac Clarke, who has not been affected yet, but survive by killing these monsters and your infected friends and loved ones.</p><p>The setting is pretty standard.  You walk around this ship finding your crew mates, or a way off the ship or something.  But come across these zombies.  It reminds me a lot of Doom.</p><p>One of the things that does stand out is the complete removal of any HUD.  You don't have a little mini-map.  You don't have an ammo counter.  All the information is in the environment as if Isaac is actually looking at it.  So the Ammo counter will be ON the gun.  Your health is stripped down your spine.  Redwood Shores completely immerses you in the game, and I think they succeed at that.</p><p>The demo had some interesting little areas too.  When running around in the demo, your main task is to restore gravity to your sector of the ship.  You have magnetic boots, so it doesn't look like you're in Zero-G.  But you can hop off the ground at any point and walk along the wall, or the ceiling.  The game will orient itself to you, so now the wall or ceiling is the floor.</p><p>I think my Fable II money is better spent on this fine product.<br/>___</p><p>It should be noted that Dead Space comes out around Halloween this year for the Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC.  Though, the two demo units at PAX were Xbox 360.  I asked the executive producer, who was at the booth, if they had a lead platform, and he assured me that it was developed for a multiplatform focus, and that all versions are identical.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 1, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 1, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">PAX: Fable II Hands On</h3><p>One of my most anticipated games this coming Christmas season is Fable II.  Fable II is an action rpg that's meant to be massive, yet have a wide variety of environments and such.</p><p>The first one really wasn't all that great.  But my roommates were hooked on how ugly all the characters were, and their god awful english accents.  We had hours of fun in the game doing stupid things to make our characters as ugly as possible.  And later on we'd recite quotes from the game in accent.  Well, honestly, it was I that was really doing all those things around the house.</p><p>When I think about how stupid the game actually is, I don't know why I'm so SHOCKED that the game blows ass.  The game looked awful.  It looked Too Human shit itself.  Ugly low resolution graphics with horribly modeled characters running around with beat sticks chopping up even uglier crap.  It felt like I was playing Nightmare Creatures on the Dreamcast.  2 minutes into the demo, I was embarassed to be seen even near the kiosk.</p><p>The whole breadcrumbs linearity is completely pandering when the environment was just as Linear as the first game.  What happened to an expansive world to immerse yourself in?
