One the posts was some comment about how they brought back all the characters that have died into all the flashbacks, but the photo for the post was a figure of Artz.  It looked like any 'ol crappy action figure, but it was still a LOST figure.  How awesome would it be to get a Jack figure and have him yelling at the Locke figure for a couple seasons or two..  Kickass awesome, that's how awesome.</p><p>I hopped on google and typed in 'lost figures' and what i found was far more than i bargained for.  Apparently McFarlane Toys picked up the rights for LOST figures.  Collecting McFarlane Toys had been one of my favorite hobbies back in high school and art college..  allow me to elaborate:</p><div class='title'><b>Back in the day...</b></div><p>I think i've always been a collector at heart.  I started off on baseball cards and garbage pal kids cards, like most kids growing up in the 80s.  I didn't really have a ton of money, so cards were really the perfect fit.  I could easily spare $1 or 2 after school to hit my local Ben Franklin (now turned into John's Variety and Pets).  Collecting cards really began the whole aspiration to completing something.  Acquiring an entire set of a specific item of this world.  Striving for completion.  Finishing what you started, and searching wide and far to accomplish your goal.  etc, etc, etc.</p><p>With collecting anything, you began to acquire a lot of excess that you don't really care about.  You usually become caught in the moment that you gloss over the fact that most things are a waste of money.  Oh well.. I'm American and this is how our country works.</p><p>Anyways, in high school i began working at Toys R Us, and lemme tell you.  Giving a kid an income at store that sells things intended for short-term entertainment value will start eating away at said income, unless they have a strong will, very good tastes, sensibility towards money or simply realize that toys are really a huge waste of money that companies make a huge premium because they are cheap pieces of crap.  Thankfully, at the time, i was in the mindset that toys are cheap pieces of crap.</p><p>However, that changed when i ran across my first glimpse of McFarlane figures.</p><div class='title'><b>Todd's Toys / McFarlane Toys</b></div><p>We had a few aisles of action figures at Toys R Us: mostly 7c and 8c though.  Most action figures are cheap pieces of crap.  They were army figures that stood straight and stoic, horribly painted, and solid colored accessories.  They were wrestling figures that all had the same body, slightly changed outfits by color or paint jobs only, and faces that looked nothing like the actual wrestler.  They were movie figures that also looked nothing like the actual actor, had no consistency of size between different movie franchises, and usually came with so many extra accessories that were never actually featured in the movie.</p><p>In a neatly straighten, plastic garden sea of mediocrity, McFarlane toys blew everything out of the water.  The first figures i laid eyes on were Spawn series 6 and 7.  These figures looked beautiful.  Faces actually had discernible features, clothing actually looked soft and flowing like real clothing, the color used represented earth tones normally found in actual human clothing.  It looked like someone ACTUALLY spent time and care making these figures, rather than just pumping out something for kids to buy.</p><p>The beauty of the figures were only matched by the medium.  You had Alien Spawn with a dark dimly painted body, wrapped in tentacles.  The Freak had actual hair, a famished physique, and baggy pants.  Each figure in this set looked drastically different than the next.  Each figure had a different posture, different build, different color, different head.</p><p>I fell in love ^_^</p><p>As new series came out, each figure became darker looking, darker colored, and more dramatic poses.  When the Spawn movie was released in the theaters, i caught the 'making of' special on the Sci Fi channel.  Todd talked about the movie, and in the last segment he talked about the figures.  During this time, he went through the process of creating his figures, and his vision of what his figures should be.</p><p>He said that he would tell his assistants that once they finished painting a figure and they think they had it just right, throw it on the ground.  "Kick it around in the dust and dirt and completely soil your paint job...  Then it'll look exactly how i want it."  He want on to explain, "These figures are representative of some happy love story environment..  These are characters in a dark, dirty world with corruption, sleaze, and villainy.  They should not only look the part, but feel it."  This is the love that goes into McFarlane Toys.</p><div class='title'><b>Coming of Age..</b></div><p>Todd really loves his toys.  He brought his comic book (Spawn) to life within his figures, and made them in his own vision.  In 1997 and 1998, He began to branch out and do this with other properties as well.  He branched to video games with his Metal Gear Solid figures, movies with Austin Powers and his Movie Maniacs series, and into music with The Beatles Yellow Submarine and Kiss.  He began making figures of his favorite franchises in the way he wanted them to look.</p><p>This move was business genius.  His figures know grabbed the attention of a much wider audience and was able to boost sales considerably.  Though, i like to think he was still making figures for himself.  This next move was proof of that.</p><p>In the year 2000, his figures branched into another one of his favorite hobbies: Baseball and other sports.  After buying Mark Mcguire's final homerun baseball of that season, he released his Baseball, Hockey and Football figures.  Again, he began making the figures he wanted, while making yet another genius business move.  Sales climbed exponentially, as he continued to release more figures.  I mean, who the hell wouldn't want a beautifully action posed 6 inch figure of their favorite sports star.</p><p>This was about the time i quit Toys R Us, i moved out of state to Wisconsin when i wanted a new start at college, rather than finishing art school.  Since i was no longer in direct contact with McFarlane figures, and didn't have that first contact with a new shipment of figures, I began to loose touch.  I checked spawn.com every now and then, but i really didn't have a community of spawn figure collectors to talk with or gain knowledge from..  so touch was lost.</p><div class='title'><b>Collecting the figures.</b></div><p>When it came to actually buying figures, a figure had to meet 1 of 2 criteria: rare or awesome.  I usually picked up the rare figure in each new series unless i just didn't like it, but whenever i came across a figure that looked awesome, i picked up that one as well, despite rarity...  hell, that's the reason you buy action figures in the first place.</p><p>McFarlane figures were always distributed to be collected.  Most figure series had 6 figures and came in a case of 12, which generally contained 2 or 3 of each common figure, and then one figure of the series intentionally distributed to be rare.  There will always be one figure that comes 1 per case, and usually it's the most scantly clad female figure of the group, or the most kickass figure of the group.</p><p>To further the collectability scheme, each series generally had 'first edition' figures.  These were figures first off the production line.  They were inspected and sometimes changed slightly, to fix errors or just improve upon.  Then the actual production of the figures commenced.  At Toys R Us we usually got a case or two of these first edition figures.  Months after the line had been in the market, McFarlane would go back and repaint this series in all new colors, and then release them again.  Generally, any given series of McFarlane figures had at least 3 separate versions of a single figure.</p><p>First editions usually don't go for too much more than regular editions.  Some of the time they are seriously flawed, which is why they were changed.  This is especially the case with one of my favorite figures: Manga Spawn from Spawn series 10.  Manga Spawn has a chain that goes from one hip bone to the other.  The first editions had a plastic chain, with huge chain links.  It looked gawd awful.  The regular version featured a metallic chain like a necklace, with tiny links and a gold shimmer.</p><p>The rare figures are always worth more, and can sometimes be next to impossible to find for an older series.  When McFarlane got the rights to the Matrix Reloaded/Revolution toys.  Each case of 20 figures, contained only one of 2 twins.  Prices for these figures immediately shut up to $35 each, and continued to climb.  They are pretty cheap these days, though.  $20 each on ebay, right now.</p><div class='title'><b>Through the dormant years</b></div><p>These past years, i've rarely glanced at spawn.com to see what has come out.  Honestly, my primary collecting efforts have turned to video games.  But whenever i find myself at a Toys R Us, i make sure to check out their figures.  Toys R Us has the best assortment of McFarlane Toys, and if you visit one less traveled, you can usually find the rare figures easily.</p><p>I have 4 personal favorites that i've collected over the years, in order of release: <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1802">Manga Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1793">Mandarin Spawn</a>, <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2138">Wings of Redemption Spawn</a>, and <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2519">Gunslinger Spawn</a>.  I would gladly take photos, if i actually had them here with me, but they are at home, displayed on my other shelves.</p><p>One of my favorite figures he has made that i do not own is <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=1844">Armchair Morpheus</a> from Matrix figure series 2.  Though, it looks pretty cheap on ebay. Also, i missed out on <a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/product.aspx?product=2658">Mandarin Spawn 2</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>Anyways, Back to Today, McFarlane has the rights to produce figures of LOST and they look amazing.  Series 1 of the LOST figures came out November 2006, and feature Charlie, Locke, Jack, Kate, Shannon, and Hurley as regular figures, plus the deluxe boxset of the Hatch.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=318</a></p><p>Like all McFarlane figures, they look simply amazing.  Of course, these photos are of the original sculpture by Todd McFarlane, and are then used to create the mold.  The final figures are based off this mold, so the most dynamic curves will smooth out a tad, and the paint job will be just a little more efficient too.</p><p>Out of series 1, the Locke figure is striking, but i think the best figure is definitely Charlie.  I would actually open that one in put it on my desk, window sill, or shelf.  I might open up the Locke figure, depending on how it actually looks.  They actually come in boxes, so the can be resealed rather easily without damaging the packaging.  huzzah.  I bet Shannon's figure is the rare one of the set.  Though, they should've made a figure of her getting shot.  I think that would've been more meaningful.</p><p>Upon further inspection, series 2 of LOST figures are released in July 2007.</p><p><a href="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346" title="http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346">http://www.spawn.com/toys/series.aspx?series=346</a></p><p>Jin's figure is pretty awesome, but overall rather bland.  The other figures are the same..  What's up with the Sun figure, though?  Is that really the most representative pose for her from LOST?  hmmm..  i suppose that was the episode where she was finally able to be free from Jin's suppression.</p><p>ahh... sweet sweet consumerism.  hmm.  After all this reminiscing i forgot all about those crappy LOST figures.</p><p><b>Edit:</b> Whooo.. i picked up The Hatch Playset at Toys R Us yesterday.  It was clearanced down to $15, so i could not say No.  I was rather surprised that $15 was the same price as the individual figures though.  Quite Pricey.  They were completely sold out of the Locke figure, had plenty of Charlie figures, and equal amounts of the other figures.  It would seem rarity is based on popularity this time, unless Locke is the intentionally rare figure of the set.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 29, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 26, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">DS - Contact</h3><p><p>Contact was released by Atlus in the states around the middle of september last year.  Sadly, I missed this release by a couple days when my plane left for planet japan.  I picked it up about a week before my next trip to japan, so I would have plenty of time to devote to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Contact follows the mis-adventure of the professor.  The professor ship had been shot by another spaceship knocking his energy crystals to the earth.  As he crashes to earth his path is crossed with our main character, Terry.  The professor plucks Terry from his daily life and pulls him into the conflict.  Now Terry will help reclaim these crystals as you guide him!</p><div class='title'><b>Art Style</b></div><p>What initially drew me to Contact was the art style.  The world of contact uses vibrant colors in fairly realistically concepted environments.  As a contrast, the world of the professor is a 16 bit throw back.  In essence Terry lives in the graphical age of today's sprite world; whereas, is stuck back on super nintendo.  When playing Contact, the professor's 16 bit world is always on top commenting on Terry's action while you guide Terry in the real world below.</p><div class='title'><b>Oh Comedy</b></div><p>The professor may seem stuck in the past, but he's pretty up on the internet.  The game manual is page after page of his live journal entries.  The real comedy gold are the references in his comments, though they do become quite short and repetitive.  Occasionally when you kill something easy, he'll say 'weaksauce.'  When you traverse the military compound, he'll make an 'all your base' reference.</p><p>The comedy is undoubtedly Contact's greatest appeal.  The story itself hasn't gone anywhere in the 5 hours i've played.  It seems to just fuel the game and push it along.  I mean, all you do is go around finding these crystals.  Then again, I had spent some time just leveling and killing townspeople.</p><div class='title'><b>Leveling</b></div><p>Anywho, Contact follows a very MMO style leveling system, as each individual skill is leveled and trained, rather than a set amount of experience.  You have all the normal rpg skills such as strength, stamina, wisdom, and defense, but weapon and magic skills are individual.  You have separate levels for swords, hand-to-hand, and blunt objects; likewise, earth, water, wind and fire elements are separate.  Leveling is pretty easy though..  You just need to use 'em.</p><p>There are other skills to level such as cooking and lock picking.  These skills are specific to the clothes that you wear, which replaces traditional style armor.  Each set of clothes have separate attributes, such as increased evade, increased strength.. But also associated abilities, like cooking and lock picking.  Clothes aren't usually found in chests or markets, though.  They generally require some sort of unlocked event or difficult optional battle.</p><p>Weapons and Clothes aren't the only stat increases.  Replacing a traditional accessory system, Contact has decals.  There are some key 'itemed' key decals, which are different, but you may equip 4 regular decals on Terry.  In the field you'll come across these decals as a '? Decal'.  In your menu, you use the stylus to peal off the decal to reveal it's true identity.  The usual ones i've run across have been stuff like Battle decal or Defense decal.  The stats they boost are drawn at random, so you can really buff up your character.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As for actual gameplay, Contact, once again, acts like an MMO.  You freely walk around, as do mobs.  Some mobs will attack you, while others will leave you alone or even run away.  Terry has a peace mode and a war mode.  While in war mode, you can point at which monsters Terry should vanquish.  You can also kill any npc you want, friend or foe.  One time I walked into a town.  The first guy said, 'hi. Welcome to our town.'  then I laid him to rest with my blade.</p><p>This is another whole aspect of Contact.  Terry can have a good alignment or an evil alignment depending on your decisions, much like Fable.  Killing baddies nets you brownie points, while the opposite does the opposite.  Luckily the game forgives one infraction each time.  It won't deduct negative alignment if your last kill was positive..  You have to do it twice in a row for that to happen.  Same with the other way..  It kinda works like tennis scoring.</p><p>Anyways, Terry also can come across spells and techniques to make life easier.  These use up EP (or whatever it's called) which is collected as you kill things.  Terry starts off with 5 max EP.  Most moves use up 1 or 2.</p><p>Running around killing monsters is pretty boring though.  You walk up to something, go into war mode, and let Terry attack away.  You can pull up the menu at any time and heal him though.  HOWEVER, this introduces another aspect.  You have a ba-zillion different things you can feed Terry to heal him, but some things will take longer to digest.  You can't feed a full stomach, so don't feed terry a bunch of 30HP hamburgers that'll take 5 minutes to get rid of.</p><p>Anywho, killing mobs may be monotanous, but at least boss battles feature some interactivity.  The first boss is some rock monster that throw punches and boulders at you..  Both of which are pretty easy to dodge.  Unlike regular enemies and if you time it right, you can defeat a boss without taking a hit.  Huzzah..</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict</b></div><p>Despite it's comedic appeal and depth of gameplay, it does get rather tedious.  Having 20 different adds a bit of depth to the game, but you have to spend some time leveling up all the stats.  It probably wouldn't be so bad, if the gameplay offered more than just going into killing mode to fight.  Some more action style moves would've broken this up..  9aybe they thought they added too much complexity already..  I haven't even touched the cooking part of the game.</p><p>At the moment I cannot definitely recommend this game one way or the other.  I'd need to spend more time to see where the story actually goes..  Though given, the current situations, you probably eventually fight the opposing forces and save the day and the comedy probably won't go any further than the comments the professor makes.</p><p>It's kind of a little gaming gem, but overall, you won't miss it.  Oh well....<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 26, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 20, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Amperos</h3><p><p>Fucking Amperos.. yet another late night venture ruined by insecurity</p><p>Amperos is an 8 story all-girls dormatory which lies at the bottom of the mountain that Gaidai sits atop of. Gaidai being short for Nagasaki Gaigokokugo Daigaku, which is japanese for Nagasaki Foreign Language University. Through some sorrid twist of fate, they put the girls dormatory right next to the school, but the guys dorm is a mile or two away.</p><p>One year, some guy started harassing some girls and tried to break in through the front. I mean, come on.. who wouldn't right? So, they erected a 7 foot fence circling the perimeter to keep the old perverts out of there.</p><p>That wasn't enough for another old guy, since he just went over the fence and then was free to harass. Steps had to be taken.. They lined their 1 foot thick concrete fences with 2 inter-weaving lines of barbed wire. But only along the landlocked portion of the perimeter.</p><p>Since Amperos is near the bottom of the mountain, its' north side hugs the road the continues up the mountain to gaidai. This has been easy to climb up and jump over before. The south face over looks the mountain as it continues down into a ravine. The drop is about 5 or 6 stories into the runoff river below. So, they must've figured that no one would get in that way.</p><p>This was still an invitation for some guys, who have tried to scale that muddy rock wall to reach the fence and climb right on in. I don't know if they put barbed wire along the south wall yet.</p><p>I think all this over security just breeds challenge for those uninvited. Its not possible to ever be 100% secure. The illusion of all this safety really just puts a big spotlight on yourself.</p><p>Anyways, needless to say, they are pretty strict about the 'girls only' rule. Each person entering the building is greeted by an orderly who stands watch during the hours when Amperos is open. Girls must return to Amperos by 10p or 11p depending on the night or else they are locked out for the evening. I guess they can't pay someone to be at the post 24 hours.</p><p>This whole thing really screws them over when they want to go out for the night to a bar and drink until whenever they've had enough. More over, it screws up a guys night when he wants his friends to join him at beardo. Much like last night.. Of course, the night probably would've been fine if i still had a room at the guy's dorm :/.. oh well</p><p>This is how last night ended.. Hoping a bus back downtown to five's place, getting some sleep and watching Fugitive 2 on the movie channel.</p><p>Overall yesterday was quite fun. I met up with mennat, natalie, miho and tina for dinner. 3 of which live in Amperos.</p><p>I ran into a couple random friends, too. A chinese guy from the forms and a chinese girl from the dance club. Both pretty surprised to see me. My chinese pal's first words to me, after asking why i was here was, "wahh, you're fat".. thank you.. at least someone said what had been on my mind for the past couple weeks. "Americans like to eat a lot of meat," he said, "its so cheap." I love non-westerner simplistic honesty..</p><p>"yeah.. that and i hardly get any exercise, eat fast-food a little too often, and have been developing a fatty recipe for about two months," i replied. Hmm... well there are 3 easy things i can change about my current lifestyle right off the bat.</p><p>Maybe i'll also try utilizing Madison's metro system as an excuse to use my legs for a change. Then again, i'll probably get back and just say fuck it. Its earie how easy it is to be lazy in America. If fast food was healthier, in general, the whole population would start to become just a little bit healthier, in general. It sucks, because all the healthy food in America either tastes bad, takes preparation, or too expensive. Blah blah blah..</p><p>Yesterday also marked plenty of video game shopping. Almost too much, actually..<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 20, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 18, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Back to Japan</h3><p><p>Flying to japan is a rather magical journey.  The flight itself is rather long and restless.  At one point you get bored looking at Canada, shut the window shade and fall into an oxygenated euphoric sleep..  Outside still stays brilliantly white.  The plane is practically staying still as the earth passes underneath.. floating in orbit.  Ascending away from the planet known as America.</p><p>The plane is bathed in white as you continue to dose.</p><p>The cabin lights awaken you as they are illuminated.  Yet another microwaved meal is served.  Outside is still white, but the ocean below has become visible.</p><p>As you stare at the open sea, the horizon begins to bend.  A dark strip of land begins to separate sky and sea.  The black mountainous terrain of japan pierces the ocean and reaches towards the sky.</p><p>A whole new planet.  Violent jagged volcanic rock fill the water..  A vast contrast to the peaceful flat surface of America.  Miles of urban terrain are hugged by the mountains.</p><p>The plane touches down and pulls into the terminal.  I pull out my alien cellphone and turn it on.  Beep beep bing!  It has reception!  The poor thing finally found its signal after being away for so long.</p><p>That is when I truly felt like i returned to this beautiful land.  It is one thing to look outside and see the wondrous differences...  The land, the people, the language.  Reconnecting into the Japanese network verifies everything that my eyes see.</p><p>I sent a bunch of messages out to people and started chatting.  Good times.</p><p>Currently, i'm sitting in the exact spot I did six months ago when i arrived the first time.  Back then all i was thinking was, "oh god, i hope i can find five without difficult." Now, i'm thinking about what i should do tonight: stay in Fukuoka or bus to Nagasaki. Spend the night at a cybac or an actual hotel..  Or bother five for a night.</p><p>My home away from home.  More exercise and better food..  though, more expensive with no income.</p><p>__</p><p>Also, my slick ass American phone doesn't catch reception over here.  Surprise, surprise.  I think i was supposed to sign up for some international service before i left, though.  Oh well..  It still works as a great text editor.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 18, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 17, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Vacation Time</h3><p><p>Whee..

I might actually be able to grab a bus to Nagasaki in Fukuoka right as i arrive.  I should probably arrive around 10pm, and those buses continue until Midnight.  That should probably work.  Then i could probably hit up cybac in Nagasaki, rather than fukuoka.  That would give me an extra day in Nagasaki.</p><p>of course, that would decrease the amount of time spent in Fukuoka.  I think i'd rather do that on the way out though.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 17, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 12, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Game Library</h3><p><p>I ran across a fun thread on the NeoGAF, where people would post all of the games they plan on purchases over the next month, though i think the intent was to post games that had purchased throughout the month..  I thought it was pretty neat.  You can see what people are actually buying, rather than look at sales numbers or just what people are complaining about, or simply what they are playing.</p><p>Concurrently to this, personally, i've been keeping track of all the games i own for well over a year.  I think i inventoried all my games around the Summer of 2004, or sometime in that Fall season.  Actually, maybe it was that christmas break.  Some people at SPAMM had their own game lists, and i knew my game library kicked the ass out of their game library.  So i cataloged.</p><p>Here's the old one: <a href="/pages/games/games2.html" title="/pages/games/games2.html" title="/pages/games/games2.html">http://www.theschlock.com/misc/games2.html</a>.  It worked out pretty well.  All the code is stuffed into one html file, which makes updating and upkeep rather easy.</p><p>Of course, no one really gave a shit..  None the less, i kept it updated and linked it from Cheap Ass Gamer like a bunch of other gaming nerds do.</p><p>In recently months, i had actually been doing something similar to what the NeoGAFers had been doing, but only in comment form..  If you view the source of that page, you'll notice after the more recently entries they have a '//added mm/dd/yyyy' after them.</p><p>I hadn't extended this idea to code or design, but that's what i did yesterday.  I think the NeoGAFers were onto something, so i took it and ran with it.</p><p>Here's the new games list: <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/games2.html</a>.</p><p>The games2.html page is pretty much the same.  The only thing i did was pull out most of the javascript and css into their own files for the other page to share..  <a href="/pages/games/lst/sales.html" title="/pages/games/lst/sales.html" title="/pages/games/lst/sales.html"> http://www.theschlock.com/pages/games/lst/sales.html</a> is the new file that extends my games list with all my recent purchases.  I also took the idea a little further by adding where i bought the game, and how much it cost.</p><p>Even though, i could probably go back a couple months and fill in information, i think i'm just going to pitch March 2007 as my starting point.  That way it'll be 100% correct, rather than missing a few pieces.</p><p>In the future, it might be fun to start adding in statistic gathering and create Trend graphs and the like.  Before that, i should probably update this with server-side scripting so it loads as fast as possible.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 12, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 11, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Backlog</h3><p><p>Now that things are starting to go well for my computer, i've begun to go through my old Japanese photos and write up posts describing my day, and all that fun stuff.

I'd never been a big fan of Digweed..  His Kiss 100 sets never really stuck with me, and i never really listened to his CDs at great length.  I finally just the chance to see him back in 2004 (<a href="/old/v6/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis">pics</a>), and it blew me away.  His progressive style is really brought out by the massive amounts of bass pumped into the atmosphere.  I was quite turned around after that point ^_^.</p><p>On the way up, i stopped off at Best Buy and as luck would have it, they had a copy of Digweed's new CD, Transitions vol. 2.  It's a great listen ^_^</p><p>I got to Myth around 10pm and crap!  This place is huge.  I thought it was pretty hilarious that they a built a club right next to Maplewood mall, but think of the convience!  Hardly any traffic and parking up to wazoo.  Now you'll actually get the people that care about being at that club..  Not just a bunch of drunks bar hopping around Minneapolis' warehouse district.  It's still kinda weird though..  Big fancy ass club nestled in between an Ashley's furniture and Toys R Us.  I probably should've taken a picture.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07527.webp" /></p><p>Anywho, as i got inside the air was filled with the incredible sounds of Eccentric Beats, Phil Martinez and his pal.  The air was also filled with smoke.  I walked past some staff saying that they couldn't stop it..  By it, they meant the smoke machines, not a fire.  I thought it was rather odd that there was this much smoke in the building..  I mean, you couldn't see but several feet in front of you.</p><p>15 minutes later, this bit the club in the ass as the fire alarm went off.  I thought it was pretty hilarious that some people were still dancing to the fire alarm before they realized it WAS a fire alarm.  Hell, i thought it was music too for a couple of moments.</p><p>The fire alarm went on for about another 15 minutes before they finally got their act together and fixed the problem..  How embarrassing..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07519.webp" /></p><p>Eventually eccentric beats finally got control of the sound system back and began to rip tracks and tear up the place, but not before Jack Trash came up with a little bit of an announcement.  Mstrkrft, the other main attraction, were apparently stuck in their hotel's elevator upon their embarkment to Myth.  So JT got Digweed to the club as fast as possible while Hotel security tried to free Mstrkrft from their cage.</p><p>It certainly seemed like it was the night of disasters.. jesus.  In fact, Mstrkrft ended up being stuck in that elevator all night and finally got to the club around 2am.. closing time.  But, this meant a full 2 hour long set by Digweed, so it worked out great for me.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07541.webp" /></p><p>Digweed came out on stage and began his set around Midnight.  Amazing.  Bass filled the air, and pounded my body.  I was bathed in rich creamy Sound.   Unfortunately, since i don't listen to Digweed all that often, i couldn't trainspot any of the tracks..  His Transitions CD is a good vantage point to reliving this music though...  you just need a wall of bass to actually experience it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07545.webp" /></p><p>Anywho, my pictures are rather few from this event since i was rocking out up front the entire time in anticipation of getting my Transitions CD signed.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070309_digweed/DSC07554.webp" /></p><p>Success!

I was pretty damn surprised to see them, as they were i, but after we thought about it.. duh.  It's Digweed in Minneapolis for godsake.  It was good to see them again ^_^.  I think the last time i ran into them was at Sasha last time he was in Minneapolis (<a href="/old/v6/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis">pics</a>).</p><p>Andy works for a cellphone company in the Minnetonka area developing those international chips for cell phones.  Which means he writes assembly all day long in the pursuit of happiness.  Since he works on international soft/hardware he gets to travel quite a bit..  His job has shipped him over to France and Austrailia.  Pretty soon, he's going over to Tokyo too.  All expenses paid, so it's not all bad ^_^.</p><p>So those little international chips that are in those new DoCoMo 'world' phones in Japan are developed back over here in Minneapolis ^_^.  That's pretty slick.</p><p>___</p><p>Anywho, the next huge event going on in Minneapolis looks to be Paul Van Dyk hitting Myth on May 10th.  I'd absolutely go to that, if it weren't on a Thursday..  But, going to Minneapolis affords many opportunities other than musical..  It might be worth a vacation day ^_^<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 10, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 9, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">300</h3><p><p>Yesterday, my roommates and i all had premiere tickets for the new action-packed Frank Miller comic-book adaptation, <em>300</em> in fitchburg's Imax theater.  300 is about 300 spartans against the invasion of the Persian empire.</p><p>Visually this movie is absolutely stunning.  Few movies have such a rich quality of picture that literally any screen shot is a vivid photo suitable for framing.  It does borrow some special effects from Sin City, where eyes and other light elements of silhouettes are illuminated..  Such as the Persian soldier's eyes as they crept over the hills.</p><p>300 is one of those movies where i have certain expectations coming into the film.  Ya know, i've seen trailers and heard about the story, and all this stuff.  I hype myself up, and when i exit the theaters.. i feel disappointed.  Like the movie totally missed the mark for me.  This is happened with a couple other movies, such as Matrix Reloaded and Scanner Darkly.</p><p>Afterwards, i get home... go to bed..  Throughout the night and the next day, i keep thinking about it more and more, and start appreciating the movie for what it is.. not what i thought or someone else thought it was supposed to be.  You can't judge some romance movie because it didn't have enough action, or comedy because it didn't have enough serious moments..  I don't really know what i was expecting 300 to be, but it stands on its own.</p><p>The movie is pretty much all action and sex and action.  Battles are waged constantly, and the battle scenes are brutally raw and bloody.  I don't think i've ever seen a movie with so much blood, yet not really consider it to be gore.  Blood flies everywhere during most scenes, but it is shed in such a violent and deliberate way..  The blood is almost a living form within the shots.</p><p>As a whole, much like the battle scenes, 300 is terrifically raw.  Half naked muscle man, stumping across the battle field, beating, and stabbing and thrusting spears into each other, yelling at the top of your lungs.  Not to mention other scenes, with naked women telling the future, and seducing the gimp, and being naked.</p><p>This movie screams Man.  It's almost as manly as ripping off your chest hair, or smashing your head into the hood of a car, or other manly feats as scene on that Snicker's superbowl commercial.  It makes you want to join in the action, and scream your head off..  "SPARTANS!" in all of your awesome glory.  Pick up a spear and join the fight.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 9, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 7, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Fried Spaghetti Recipe</h3><p class='img'><p>howdy all..  for the last month and half i decided to work on a recipe that came up while i was in Japan.  One day, when shopping at the dinner discount grocery store, i came across some spaghetti noodles.  Oh baby, i hadn't had spaghetti in such a long time.  That's what's for dinner tonight!  I picked up a couple boxes, some spices, and went on my merry way.</p><p>At home though, all i had was a frying pan.  I didn't have a strainer or a big 'ol or any of the usual instruments.  My frying pan was kinda deep, so i figured i could just use that and then drain out the water somehow.  I started frying up the noodles and something amazing happened.  All the water in teh pan either boiled off or was absorbed by the noodles..  All that was left in the pan were the noodles, and i used this opportunity to fry them a little bit for the ultimate taste.  I chucked some cheese on them at the same time, and it was the most delicious spaghetti i had ever tasted..</p><p>Once i got back and started cooking again, and sought to perfect this recipe..

I filled out all the fields with random characters to see if i could get with that, but no..  I went through the code to check out the validation and there are 3 things that must be true in order for a Credit Card to be valid before it even considers processing.  One of these things was just that it wasn't expired, but the other 2 dealt with the number itself.</p><p>Since i was inputting a VISA card, the number had to follow a few conventions.  It had to be either 13 or 16 digits long, and had to start with a 4.  Our processing software has a bunch of other card types as well, each with their own conventions specifying the length of the number, and the first couple digits prefixing the number.</p><p>The real interesting requirement was the number had to follow the Luhn Formula, which i later looked up on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">wikipedia</a>.  The Luhn Formula states that when you double every other number starting from the end up the digit sequence and then add all the digits together, their sum is divisible by 10.</p><p>So...</p><p>If you have a some random number sequence: a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6</p><p>Double every other digit starting from the back: 2(a1) a2 2(a3) a4 2(a5) a6</p><p>Add them all together:  2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6</p><p>They should be divisble by 10:  (2(a1) + a2 + 2(a3) + a4 + 2(a5) + a6) % 10 = 0 (formula 1)</p><p>Moving some things around we'd get this formula if the number of digits are even: ( 2(a(1..n odd)) + a(2..n even) ) % 10 = 0</p><p>So....  this is how i needed to derive my fake Visa number to continue along the ordering process.  I began using the conventions defined with the card type, so that gave me this template: 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.</p><p>Since we take every other digits, let's split up the variables a little bit: 4xyx yxyx yxyx yxyx.</p><p>Plugging this number into our formula, gives us ( 2(4 + 7y) + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 8 + 14y + 8x ) % 10 = 0 or ( 4 + 7y + 4x ) % 5 = 0 (formula 2)</p><p>That 7 is rather annoying, but we've already hit prime with the 5, so you can't really reduce it much further.  Luckily it's in a cute little formula that we could just plug in numbers to find something simple..  This is, of course, if we wanted all x to be the same and all y to be the same.  Otherwise formula 2 would be formula 1.</p><p>Anywho.. looking at formula 2 for a few seconds may give you an answer.  if y = 1 and x = 1, it succeeds.  I've got my fake Visa number 4111 1111 1111 1111, but you could go the easy route and have y = 0 and find x = 4, or x = 0 and find y = 3.</p><p>I suppose it would've been easily if i kept my number as 4xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.  Then i would've found ( 4 + 11x ) % 5 = 0, and found x = 1 very quickly..  or that i could use x = 6 too.</p><p>After looking into this stuff, i've realized just how insecure this whole system is. It's pretty easy to make up a fake Visa number, but taking a look at that wikipedia article, the Luhn Formula is not meant for encryption, just validation.  Just a little housekeeping, so someone doesn't screw up and type a 5 rather than a 6 and still get a valid number.  This is used for all credit card numbers too, so if you're bored why not double check your Visa number to see if its valid.</p><p>Math is everywhere ^_^<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 6, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 4, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (3)</h3><p><p><b>Java 6 Features</b> w/ Venkat Subranium</p><p>On this third day of christmas I started of in Venkat's Java 6 features talk, which was rather enlightening.  He talked about how Java 6 has integrated the use of scripting languages into the java language and how scripting languages can use the java libraries on their own.  You can also pull in script files into your java code, run them, and play around with the results of the run code.</p><p>Something that peeked my curiosity a little more was the next feature he talked about: instantiated an instance of the compiler and being able to compile and run new code at runtime.  That's freakin' awesome.  You could do some pretty fun AI functionality by setting up some program that would write, compile and run code all on its own.  I think about having just a simple Body class sitting on a server somewhere.  It doesn't have much... just one method that takes in a filepath.  I'll send that sucker an Arm class..  The body reads and runs that Arm class and instantly makes it its own.  Pretty handy.</p><p>Eventually if you quite giving more intelligent body parts it might be able to start writing up code for making its own limbs and the code monster keeps growing...  Then the terminator would come back through time to kill me.</p><p><b>Advanced Selenium</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>Anywho...  the next panel I went to was Selenium which was also pretty slick.  Even though we use Selenium at work, i never really knew what it was about.  I thought it was just some JavaScript testing tool...  but i guess i got that backwards.  Selenium is a testing tool written in JavaScript.  You can, or write Java code to, fill out table information representing actions taken to traverse your website.  Stuff like..  fill in User text field with 'NameString', click on login, click on this and that, buy this, logout, all the while sticking in several asserts to make sure your system is doing what you want.</p><p>This is a fantastic way to test your webframe work.  Just input all your Use cases into Selenium, hit play, and it'll return all the infractions of your Use cases for you.  Huzzah..  No need to run through everything on your own.</p><p>You could also setup Selenium to run a bunch of macros that will get your within your system quicker..</p><p><b>Expert Panel</b> @ Lunch</p><p>After lunch was the expert panel discussion, which had 8 or 9 speakers take questions from the crowd.  The question of 'how should students be taught programming basics and lore when there are so many modern day languages and tools that remove the need to explicitly know about them?' was posed.  Problems are posed when teaching students only Java as language, because then they know nothing of garbage collection and memory leaks.  Problems are posed when teaching students a loosely typed language, because then type know nothing of type casting and such.  Where do teachers begin the learning process, yet still get them up to speed with the technologies of today.</p><p>Everyone on the panel said their peace about their thoughts..  Certainly, the consensus was don't tie them down to one language and CERTAINLY don't tie them down to one platform.  No one language is infinite.  One quote from the weekend was, "Don't think of software as gold bars sitting in a vault..  Software is more like lettuce.  If you let it sit, it will degrade and rot away.. "  This is true with all technologies in this field.  You have to keep current to be a valued member of this industry or else you'll be structurally unemployed sooner than you think.</p><p>This really extends further to almost all industries..  All industries evolve..</p><p>As an addendum, they added, that that's not to say forget about the past..  You don't need to know how to write code at the byte code level, but you should definitely know how that byte level code is used.  You should know the inner workings of the constructs you are building on.  Computers aren't MAGIC..  they are technological devices built on technologies built on technologies..  If you don't know how the technologies you are using as a foundation, then you have no business building on them.</p><p>Another topic brought up during this time was open source technologies with the slogan, "get your ass out there and help out"  Open source communities are the main driver's for developing these technologies, not just creators of the technologies..  The communities are the ones that pick up the left over parts, fix bugs and clean up the code which shapes and completes the projects..  Even if you needed a selfish reason to work on something, think of the scenario of coming into a job interview and being able to say that you worked on that open source technology that that company is currently using.  Dump that on your resume.</p><p><b>Reflection</b> w/ Ted</p><p>After such stirring lunch conversation, the sessions started up again.  I attended Ted ___'s guide to reflection.  Reflection is basically making an object that is the representation of a class.  This object has all the methods and fields, but this is not an instantiation of the class itself.  With reflection you can actual get to private data and methods..  Which is handy in some instances..</p><p>This is also how annotations are utilized.  When you grab the class, you can get the annotations from that class and process that information.  huzzah.  This was a repeat of Venkat's annotation talk the previous morning.</p><p><b>10 Ways to Improve your code</b> w/ Neil Ford</p><p>stuff to come...<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 4, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 3, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">No Fluff Just Stuff @ Milwaukee (2)</h3><p><p>The sessions I attended today were rather amazing.</p><p><b>Annotation Hammer</b> w/ Venkat Subramaniam</p><p>The first session I attended was venkat talking about using annotations in java.

This whole conference seems to be very Jave development oriented and  showcases several brilliant developers of Java and Java-like technologies.  There is also a huge focus on thw web services side of Java development,  which makes this conference right up my own alley, as well as, Widen's alley.</p><p>It's pretty much like any convention except the people speaking are actual experts rather than amatuer fans of the product.  Case in point, the three speakers I attended today were actually developers of the framework they showcased.  David Gaery showcased JSF, Venkat Subramaniam showcased Grails, and Scott Davis showcased Atom, though Davis isn't really responsible for Atom.  It is really amazing to listen to these heavyweights of the Java community talk about their passion.</p><p>Atom certainly caught my eye today, but what i'm really shopping around for is a web framework I can use and implement for theschlock.com.</p><p>JSF was kinda fun, but it felt rather heavy duty for what I wish to accomplish.  Grails is simply amazing, but it seemed difficult to customize.</p><p>What I want to do with theschlock.com is quite simply.  I want to make it a navigatable portfolio of all my old art and other random crations i've had over the years.  An end all resource of all the crap I've done.</p><p>I want to use one of these crazy new technologies because it'll give me the experience of playing around with something new and cool, as well as demonstrate my proficency of applying said technology.</p><p>After thinking about a few things though: what I want to do is quite simply.  A ton of entries sorted by date and possibly by category.  This is easily accomplished using technologies i've been using for the past couple of years.  Hell, just build a javascript 'database' type file and have page javascript load and render all those elements and huzzah..  i've got my website.  :shrugs: I guess I could do it that way.  why make things more complicated then they have to be.</p><p>Maybe i'll just search for a technology to develop a beautiful photo navigator for all the 15,000 pictures i've taken over these last four years.</p><p>Anyways, Grails is pretty amazing.  I wouldn't mind playing around with that.  Much like its' initial model: rails, it utilizes Convention over Configuration, which means you do everything a specific way rather than write up a bunch of config files to tell he framework what the hell you are doing.  This type of framework lends itself extremely well to Agile development, since you can write code fast, rather than spending time configuring everything.</p><p>The highlight of the evening was Scott Davis' keynote speach, which confronted the question of choice...  basically.</p><p>ugh...  I'm typing this up on my phone and getting rather bored.  i'll finish this up later.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 2, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 1, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Vista work around</h3><p><p>I finally got my computer working the other day. Tony fixed it for me, and, being the gentleman he is, he installed Windows Vista on there for me. Finally, I am a part of the modern age! However, i couldn't find the product key for Vista, so after a day or two, Vista started complaining that my copy wasn't Genuine. How dare they insult my intentions!</p><p>When such things occur, they give you 3 options. You could quit and go back to the login screen, buy a product key from Microsoft directly, or you can operate in a reduced functionality mode of Windows. If you click on the reduced functionality option, it'll open up IE 7.0, and allow you to browse the web to buy a key online, or something like that.</p><p>Well, Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer are pretty much the same piece of bread, I figured.  I typed in 'c:/' as my URL, and what d'ya know! It opened up Windows Explorer. That's pretty funny. Now, I was able to watch movies and stuff while waiting for a product key.</p><p>Hey wait a minute... If i can still open up programs in reduced functionality mode, I should also be able to... I browsed to my c:/windows/ directory, and clicked on explorer.exe.  Sure enough, it opened up a fully functions windows. Interesting.</p><p>So, if Vista complains about your copy not being genuine, just file browse to Windows and open up Windows manually.</p><p>Of course, you still have that non-minimizable and non-closable window complaining about your disingenuous copy of Windows. That scoundrel! But, you can just move that to a corner of your desktop.</p><p>I wonder how long it'll be before Microsoft patches this up.</p><p>PS: I'm sure this has already been posted somewheres on the internet a thousand times by now.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 1, 2007<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">March 2007</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/vista-work-around">1</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee">2</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-2">3</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/no-fluff-just-stuff-milwaukee-3">4</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/luhn-formula">6</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/fried-spaghetti-recipe">7</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/300">9</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/digweed-myth-minneapolis">10</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/backlog">11</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/game-library">12</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/vacation-time">17</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/back-to-japan">18</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/amperos">20</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/ds-contact">26</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/mcfarlane-lost-toys">29</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
