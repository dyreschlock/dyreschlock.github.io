Oni are physical strong Japanese demons who ravage and destory small villages in ancient Japanese folklore. Only brave warriors can face and defeat them.</p><p>The hill itself was formed from rocks pushed up out of the ground from earthquakes and then tempered by the waves and weather. During the sengoku period, a small castle was built on the top of the hill to easily spot armies using the coastline to travel south.</p><p>With the image of Oni carved into these cliffs, the castle became known as Onigajo <span class='ja'>鬼ヶ城</span> or Oni Castle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6797_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Visiting the cliffs is free, and it has plenty of parking. There's a visitor center at the parking lot, which directs people to the path leading to the cliffs.</p><p>The stone from above is pretty clean, like any exposed mountain surface. The stone closer to the sea water is much more fitting of rock eroded by salt and water.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6860_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's amazing how soft and brittle the stone looks on its own. But it is literally rock hard, and any sharp peaks of the rock, could easily cut or puncture skin.</p><p>Railings were planted into the rocks to keep people from falling or slipping into the ocean. The path leads through the giant Oni face and further past the other side. Unfortunately, the rest of the 1km path along the coast was closed due to erosion.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_6890_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The original path leading all the way around the cliffs was ruined and too dangerous to travel. The path was meant to circumnavigate the whole hill. But, I had to turn back.</p><p>Coming back to the visitor center, there was a short hiking path that lead to the top of the hill where the castle once stood. Now, it's an open park with a great view of the surrounding area. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7050_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The hill is aligned with many cherry blossom trees. I think I was about a week late to see them in full bloom, though. From the top, I had a clear view of the town below, Kumano-Odomari Town. I also had a clear view of a very distinct Island off the coast.</p><div class='title'><b>Mamiruga Island <span class='ja'>魔見ヶ島</span></b></div><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7043.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7043_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7043_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7043_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Mamirugashima is a small uninhabited island about 1.5km away from the coast of Onigajo. The local people call it Maburika for some reason, and old folks usually row to it as a good fishing spot.</p><p>The plaque near the visitor center explains the legend of this island. In the late 700s, during the reign of Emperor Kanmu, Shogun Sakaue Tamuramaru was ordered to defeat the demon leader who held Oni Castle at that time. It was a fierce battle. During the battle a small boy on Mamiruga Island was seen dancing and singing songs. This made the demon open the castle door to get a better look. This given the Shogun the opportunity to fire a single arrow at the demon, and kill it instantly.</p><p>The Kanji <span class='ja'>魔見</span> means Demon Looks. <span class='ja'>魔</span> or ma is the kanji for demon, and <span class='ja'>見る</span> is the kanji for look.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160330_oni_coast/IMG_7127_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Before leaving the area and heading home, I stopped at an overlook on the other side of door given a view of the cliffs, the hill, and the park on top of the hill.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Mar 2025 and back-dated to the time of my visit.</i><br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 30, 2016<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 30, 2016</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Myohozan Amida Temple 阿彌陀寺</h3><p>While visiting Taiji, and exploring all the locations I researched prior about their whaling and The Cove, I noticed a very prominent Buddhist Manji symbol on the side of a mountain.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5718.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5718_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5718_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5718_t.webp" /></a></p><p>What was up there? How could I get there? After finishing everything related to Taiji for the day, I looked up the location at night, and planned on going there on my way home the next day.

In 2011, when my brother and I came to Japan, we did sight-seeing around the Kansai region of Japan.  I looked into the logistics of being able to visit Taiji, but it was just too far out of the way, and quite expensive by train.  Driving was really the only sensible option.</p><p>Now that I live in Japan, and drive in Japan, I finally took the opportunity to go there.  Taiji is located on the southern end of the Kii peninsula, so the most sensible route will always enter the town from the north.  That's where I found that dolphin bridge from <a href="/old/v6/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama" title="/the-cove-and-taiji-wakayama">the previous post</a>.  On the hill past the dolphin bridge are two large whale statues welcoming you to town.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5687.webp" /></a></p><p>Continuing along, the road curves around the coastline.  There's a shabby-looking, rundown hotel just before the road straightens out, and shoots straight forward to the whale museum and other attractions.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5704_stitch.webp" /></a></p><p>The road is lined with palm trees, and a cement barricade blocking the crashing waves onto the land.  Some townspeople sat along the ends of the piers and cement walls trying to catch some fish.</p><p>At the end of the straight road was the Kyo Maru No. 1, a research and whaling vessel.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_taiji/IMG_5732_stitch.webp" /></a></p><p>Nearby were large clamps.  After the "research" vessel fires enough harpoons into the whale to tire it down, and keep it from fighting, the metal contraption clamps into the whale's tail, and hauls it back from the ocean to land for their meat.</p><p>From here, I started roaming around town a little bit to figure out some locations.  I went passed the whaling museum, and saw the cove.  I continued on and went to the downtown area, found the city hall, and took photos overlooking the area.  I went back to the cove, and took those photos.  Then hiked up the northern surrounding mountain, which gave a nice view of the area.

They did their tricks and got their small treats as rewards.</p><p>After watching <a href="/old/v6/the-cove" title="/the-cove">The Cove</a> all those years ago, I can't stop thinking about the well-being of these dolphins, or really any animal in captivity.  The Cove made mention that dolphins communicate and hear through echo-location and sound.  The subtle reverberations of their pings bouncing off walls and objects in the open water to give them a sense of location.</p><p>In a tank, they're obviously trapped and surrounded by sound.  What's worse is the sound of the announcer from the speakers blaring overhead.  And the crowd clapping and cheering them on.  It can be sensory overload for a dolphin or   a porpoise.  Many captive dolphins commit suicide, or damage themselves by ramming into the sides of their tank to try and make the pain go away.  At least, for ones caught in the wild.</p><p>I think there's some law enacted that states dolphins, orca, and other porpoises can no longer be caught in the wild for the porpoises of captivity because it's so damaging and harmful to them.  Only sea-mammals born and raised in captivity are allowed to be kept in captivity.  </p><p>This is probably directly because of their echo-location senses.  Being born and raised in captivity allows them to live with the noise their entire life, and adapt from the very beginning.  Though, this means they could never be released in the wild.  We've basically split their species on a different evolutionary path, much like dogs and wolves.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_5993_t.webp" /></a></p><p>But, they flip around and jump around, and everyone claps.  I wonder what actually compels these dolphins to obey.  They are just animals, but they're smarter than most.  Smarter than dogs.  I wonder if they have some kind of loyalty gene as well, and since we've had them in captivity long enough, those loyalty genes have been passed on to their offspring, continuing the cycle, breeding a more loyal dolphin.</p><p>At some point, this gets just as perverse as dog breeding.  Though, the real perversion of this place is to come.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6005_t.webp" /></a></p><div class='title'><b>Enclosed Bay</b></div><p>Passed the dolphin tanks is an enclosed bay connected to the ocean.

Successfully capturing and killing one of these massive creatures could easily feed the town for months.  Back in the day, whales used to come quite close the coast.  Hundreds of years ago, there were very few large ships patrolling the oceans, and there were all made of wood.  They were no mechanical noises to ward away the creatures of the sea.</p><p>The hunters of the village, would get into smaller boats (models shown above), and extend very large nets between multiple ships.  Once a whale was captured in the nets, and they could get close, the hunters repeatedly stabbed and skewered the beast with their spears.  Eventually wounding it enough, to be pulled onto the beach, and killed.</p><p>Such effort must have taken almost an entire day.  Even when killer whales kill a seal in the open ocean, it takes about 8 hours before they've beaten it enough for it to quit fighting back.  Only once the hunters have destroyed the whales will to live, could they drag it close enough to the beach to finish the job.</p><p>Extended in the middle of the building was a 1:1 scale of the hunters preparing to attack their prey.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6198_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The area showed some of the more modern equipment used to kill whales, but it was small in comparison to their traditional hunting methods.</p><div class='title'><b>Biology</b></div><p>The middle floor focused on the biology of the sea mammals.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160329_whale_museum/IMG_6215_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The first corner had several internal organs of whales.

This philosophy is evident in Japanese arts such as poetry, singing, calligraphy, tea ceremony, and flower arrangement, where the names of the art includes the suffix <i>dou</i>.  Budo is another example.  Budo is a system of armed and unarmed fighting techniques, but martial arts and skills alone do not constitute budo in the philosophical sense.  Actual fighting techniques were called <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> and were considered distinct from budo.</p><p>The goal of <i>bugei</i> or <i>bujutsu</i> is to defeat an opponent but this is not necessarily the case in budo.  Naturally, budo practitioners also train to defeat an opponent, however that is just one part of the process of achieving the larger goal of self-development.  Put simply, in budo, as with training in other <i>dou</i> arts, perfection of one's character is the ultimate objective.</p><p>An individual who has achieved excellence in a particular field may be called a <i>meijin</i> (master) or <i>tatsujin</i> (expert).  While the terms <i>meijin</i> and <i>tatsujin</i> refer to the technical proficiency of the individual, the terms may also be used to refer to an individual who possesses unique traits and is recognized as being wise or holy, such as Confucius or Buddha.  Budo as a form of <i>dou</i>, provides the practitioner with a 'path' or means to achieve the enlightened awareness of a wise or holy person.  If, through achieving a high degree of self-development, a person has attained some desirable attribute, then we call this personality trait their 'virtue' (<i>toku</i>).  There are many difference kinds of virtues that people try to develop in themselves and these values are generally universal.  However ethnic, cultural, and religious groups often differ in their opinions on which virtues are the most important.</p><p>Fundamental virtues of particular importance are called 'cardinal virtues' (<i>gentoku</i>).  In Christianity, faith, hope, and love are espoused as the three cardinal values (Corinthians 13).  In ancient Greek philosophy, wisdom, courage, restraint, and justice, formed the four cardinal virtues.  In Confucianism, the five values were benevolence, justice, courtesy, wisdom, and sincerity, and the the three virtues were wisdom, benevolence, and courage.  In this lecture I will discuss some of the important virtues associated with Japanese budo taking into account Buddhist and Shinto thought.</p><div class='title'><b>Unpacking the abstract, and defining terms</b></div><p>First, a virtue or <i>toku</i> <span class='ja'>徳</span> is a positive personality trait.  It's something that contributes to the dignity of one's life.  <i>Gentoku</i> <span class='ja'>元徳</span> is a fundamental virtue of importance, or <b>cardinal virtue</b>.  These are the basic building blocks of what makes a desirable personality.  As mentioned above in the abstract, wisdom, benevolence, courage as examples of cardinal virtues.</p><p><i>Budo</i> <span class='ja'>武道</span> is field of martial arts, but it doesn't cover all martial arts.  According to The Budo Charter, budo are Japanese martial ways that have been transformed and evolved from combat techniques (<i>jutsu</i>) into ways of self-development (<i>dou</i>).  There are only nine such martial arts: judo <span class='ja'>柔道</span>, kendo <span class='ja'>剣道</span>, kyudo (archery) <span class='ja'>弓道</span>, sumo <span class='ja'>相撲</span>, karatedo <span class='ja'>空手道</span>, aikido <span class='ja'>合気道</span>, shorinji kempo <span class='ja'>少林寺拳法</span>, naginata <span class='ja'>なぎなた</span>, and jukendo <span class='ja'>銃剣道</span>.  </p><p>As mentioned in the abstract, most of these martial arts carry the kanji suffix <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>, which identifies them as a path to self-improvement.  Many other arts in Japan also carry this suffix, such as tea ceremony or <i>sado</i> <span class='ja'>茶道</span>, calligraphy or <i>shodo</i> <span class='ja'>書道</span>, and flower arrangement, or <i>kado</i> <span class='ja'>華道</span>/<span class='ja'>花道</span>.  I don't really understand why iaido <span class='ja'>居合道</span> isn't a budo art, but I guess that's because it's not meant as a means for combat?  Or perhaps it doesn't stem from a former form of combat?</p><p>Despite being different forms of combat, training, and practice, budo martial arts are all connected by the same virtues of self-development and self-improvement.  If a martial art does not follow these virtues, and doesn't set one on the path to self-improvement, it is not considered <i>dou</i> <span class='ja'>道</span>.  In that case, they are pure fighting techniques, or <i>jutsu</i> <span class='ja'>術</span>.  The virtues of those martial arts and sports are different.</p><p>Because all forms of <i>dou</i> carry the same virtues and basic fundamentals, scholars consider this the reason why so many military commanders and famous swordsman of the past were also great poets, musicians, and writers.  They had some deep connections with themselves and could easily express it.</p><p>This is also why many budo practitioners these days have ranks in multiple branches of budo or other Japanese arts, rather than only one course of study.</p><div class='title'><b>3 important Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>After reading that description and beginning the lecture, I really wanted a straight list of virtues.  I wanted something like, "The cardinal virtues of Japan are…"  But that's not how it went.  Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> mentioned that there would not be enough time to mention all the virtues of Japan, and explain why they were so revered.</p><p>Looking through my notes of the lecture, and from what I remember, he focused on 3 particular virtues he found as important.</p><p>- <span class='ja'>礼</span> <i>rei</i> - respect and gratitude<br/>- <span class='ja'>文武両道</span> <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> - the balance between strength and wisdom<br/>- <span class='ja'>無</span> <i>mu</i> - nothingness</p><div class='title'><b>Rei <span class='ja'>礼</span></b></div><p>Physically, <i>rei</i> is the act of bowing.  It's an expression of the importance of order, and an outward expression of our inner <b>respect</b>.  It's a sign that we should love and respect other people, rather than hate.  All human relations are founded on the two principles of <i>shinrai</i>, people trusting and being friendly to each other, and <i>sonkei</i>, acknowledging and respecting those different from you.  And physically bowing to someone is an expression of both.</p><p>As an example, it is respectful for hosts to please their guests.  It's their duty to go above and beyond the capabilities of their guest and impress them.  And it's respectful for guests to acknowledge and show gratitude for everything the host has done for them.  Even if they disappoint, it is always the guest's duty to return the same magnitude of respect to the host.  In that same vain, bowing is also a show of <b>gratitude</b> and thanks.</p><p>In his lecture, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> brought to the topic to respect on the battlefield, or <i>gunjin no rei</i> <span class='ja'>軍陣の礼</span>.  Though, battlefields and war refer more to the fighting done in the warring states period of Japan, not necessarily modern warfare.  Before a battle or fight, bowing to your opponents shows mutual respect for each other as warriors.  Bowing at the end, signifies a return to the state outside on conflict.  It was a way to preserve our humanity even in the face of conflict, and separates us from animals.</p><p>Without bowing on the battlefield, we're nothing but blood-thirsty war-mongering people.  Winning a battle or war at all costs, and dehumanizing and humiliating the enemy is a sign of cowardice and disrespect.  These kind of people are not human, and should be dealt with like animals.</p><div class='title'><b>The Balance between Strength and Wisdom</b></div><p>There's a Japanese term called <i>bunbu ryoudou</i> <span class='ja'>文武両道</span>.  As long time ago, it meant being accomplished in both literary and military arts, or, that all military training should be correctly balanced with scholarship.</p><p>Today, the meaning has changed a little.  Now the translation means having both <b>strength</b> and <b>wisdom</b>.  It basically means the same thing, but the military and fighting connotation has been removed.  This change was influenced by western thought thanks to terms like "the pen is mightier than the sword."</p><p>The forces of strength and wisdom are often depicted with red and blue colors.  In popular culture, these colors often depict characters that represent strength or wisdom, such as the power rangers.  If you remember the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the red ranger was the leader of the group, and always the strongest.  He is usually not smart, but feels passion and emotion which often leads him into combat.  The blue ranger, while not necessarily the weakest of the rangers, was certainly the smartest.</p><p>But, strength doesn't mean to simply have physical strength.  Strength also refers to their strength of ones heart and will.  It's the ability to love and compassion.  Without this kind of strength, a person is just blood thirsty.  True warriors fight with compassion.</p><p>You can see this ALL the time in Shonen Jump series such as Dragonball and One Piece.  Goku and Luffy often lack the wisdom side of the coin, but their strength always comes their compassion for their friends, or what is just or right.  They never enter into a fight for no reason.</p><div class='title'><b>Nothingness <span class='ja'>無</span></b></div><p>The goal for any budo practitioner is to be able to perform moves and actions naturally and without thinking.  This is known as a state of <i>jizai</i> <span class='ja'>自在</span>, or naturality.  How is this done?  One way is to achieve this state of nothingness.</p><p>By nothingness I mean that the practitioner wishes to have a simple state of being.  This can be done through the unification of the following 3 states of consciousness:  <b>sincerity</b>, <b>selflessness</b>, and being able to <b>free the mind of thoughts</b>.</p><p>Following these states, the practitioner is able to free themselves of themselves.  Their own ego, wants, and desires are no longer in their way, and everything becomes instinct, and natural.</p><p>True masters and experts strive for this ideal state of character, and can achieve these states at will.</p><p>This aligns with true virtues:  the virtue of <b>honesty</b> or <i>shoujiki</i> <span class='ja'>正直</span>, and the virtue of <b>purity of spirit</b>, or <i>seijou</i> <span class='ja'>清浄</span>.  The lecturer make a point by saying, "I believe these are the most important of the virtues."</p><div class='title'><b>The Book of Japanese Cardinal Virtues</b></div><p>Not quite being satisfied from my notes of the lecture, I wanted to know all of the cardinal virtues of Japan.  I wanted the finish this sentence: "The cardinal virtues of Japan are …"  Fortunately, Kanno<span class='ja'>先生</span> literally wrote the book on the subject.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1963_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The lecture was actually just a small snippet of what he wrote about.  Though, the book isn't just an answer to "What are the Cardinal Virtues of Japan?"  It's a published account of all personality traits found good and desirable in Japan in different circumstances and situations, how they've been developed, and how they relate to budo culture in most cases.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/160305_budo/IMG_1965_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I can't actually read it.  But, I can translate the table of contents and form a decent list of what's inside.  The contents are split into 4 sections: order and harmony, world citizenship, self-development, and objects of self-improvement.</p><div class='title'><b>Order <i>chitsujo</i> <span class='ja'>秩序</span> and Harmony <i>wagou</i> <span class='ja'>和合</span></b></div><p>These virtues mostly deal with the inner expression of yourself.  These are your thoughts and feelings about the world around you, and how you conduct your life.  Some of these are also outward expressions that demonstrate or convey your inner thoughts and ideals.</p><p><span class='ja'>側隠の心</span> <i>sokuin no kokoro</i><br/><b>Compassion of the Heart</b> or "showing sympathy or pity."  Apparently <i>sokuin</i> has more of a negative connotation, so I think "pity" is better.  But, that doesn't really make sense.  Wouldn't the ideal be showing compassion and sympathy for others by not looking down on them?  Being one with them, and looking past any ego driven or vain thoughts about yourself?</p><p><span class='ja'>敬</span> - <span class='ja'>「うやまう」「つつしむ」</span> <i>kei</i> - <i>uyamau tsutsushimu</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b>.  Being able to show respect <i>uyamau</i> to other people, and being modest <i>tsutsushimu</i> about your own achievements.  This is the same kanji used in <i>keigo</i> <span class='ja'>敬語</span>, which is the honorific / respectful words and language used in Japanese.</p><p><span class='ja'>清浄</span> <i>seijou</i> <br/> <b>Purity</b> - pure of heart / innocence (like a baby)</p><p><span class='ja'>礼</span> - <span class='ja'>天地の序</span> <i>rei</i> - <i>techi no ji</i> <br/> <b>Respect</b> and <b>Gratitude</b>.  This was already mentioned above, but it's the idea of performing things in a set order.  The act of bowing preludes heaven and earth.</p><p><span class='ja'>倹約</span> - <span class='ja'>均衡</span> - <span class='ja'>調和の知恵</span> <i>kenyaku</i> - <i>kinkou</i> - <i>chouwa no chie</i> <br/> <b>Frugality - Balance - Harmony of Wisdom</b>.  This is the idea that simplicity is best.  You should rid yourself of unnecessary things in your daily life, and only live with what is needed.  You must manage overindulgence.</p><div class='title'><b>World Citizenship <span class='ja'>世の中の一員</span></b></div><p>These virtues are about yourself outward expression to the world.  This is how someone should conduct themselves as a member of their community, society, and the world.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> - <span class='ja'>百行の本</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>hyakkou no moto</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> - the foundation of all actions.  Filial Piety means your undying loyalty to your parents and family, and essentially having the capacity to support them as they have supported you.  Apparently, this is foundations of all of our actions in our lives.</p><p><span class='ja'>孝</span> (<span class='ja'>続</span>) - <span class='ja'>親子の真実</span> <i>koi</i> - <i>oyako no shinjitsu</i> <br/> <b>Filial Piety</b> (continued) - the nature of the relationship between parent and child.</p><p><span class='ja'>勤勉</span> - <span class='ja'>世のため人のための徳</span> <i>kinben</i> - <i>yo no tame hito no tame no toku</i> <br/> <b>Diligence</b>.  This is the virtue of people who do things for the greater good of the world.  Those that work hard everyday at what they do.</p><p><span class='ja'>義</span> - <span class='ja'>人間の条件</span> <i>gi</i> - <i>ningen no jouken</i> <br/> <b>Morality</b> or <b>Justice</b> - the human condition.  Members of yakuza gangs use the term <i>gi</i> to describe the rules they enforce in the public and among themselves.</p><p><span class='ja'>信義</span> - <span class='ja'>公共の精神</span> <i>shingi</i> - <i>koukyou no seishin</i> <br/> <b>Trust</b> / <b>Faith</b> / <b>Loyalty</b> - the spirit of common sense.  This means having faith in society that they'll do the right things, and by being a member of society that you uphold that faith of common sense.</p><p><span class='ja'>分別</span> - <span class='ja'>大人の道徳</span> <i>bunbetsu</i> - <i>otona no doutoku</i> <br/> <b>Judgement</b> (or <b>Discrimination</b>) - the morals and ethics of adults.</p><div class='title'><b>Self-development <span class='ja'>自己を育てる</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>誠</span> - <span class='ja'>修行の思想</span> <i>makoto</i> - <i>shugyou no shisou</i> <br/><b>Honesty</b> or <b>Integrity</b> - the ideals of <i>shugyou</i> training.  Translating <i>shugyou</i> only as 'training' loses a lot of its meaning.  <i>Shugyou</i> training is strict self-disciplined mental and physical training like a samurai.  Examples would be doing the same disciplined training everyday exactly the same to achieve perfection.  Or, there's the example of a samurai sitting and meditating under a waterfall.  The purpose is to try and attain a state of zen or a state of <i>mu</i>.  It's these ideals that establish integrity.</p><p><span class='ja'>忠</span> - <span class='ja'>普遍的価値への奉仕</span> <i>chuu</i> - <i>fuhen-teki-kachi e no houshi</i> <br/><b>Loyalty</b> - devoting oneself to the universal values of loyalty.</p><p><span class='ja'>和</span> - <span class='ja'>『憲法十七条』の精神</span> <i>wa</i> - <i>[kenpou 17 jou] no seshin</i><br/> <b>Harmony</b> - the spirit of the Seventeen-article constitution.  The Seventeen-article constitution is a document written by Prince Shoutoku Taishi in 604.  It was a highly Buddhist and Confucian inspired set of morals and virtues that were to be expected of government officials and the emperor's subjects.  An excerpt from Wikipedia states, "Harmony is to be valued, and the avoidance of wanton opposition to be honored."</p><p><span class='ja'>克己</span> - <span class='ja'>忍耐</span> - <span class='ja'>現代に最もっとも必要な徳</span> <i>kokki</i> - <i>nintai</i> - <i>gendai ni sai motto mo hitsuyou na toku</i> <br/><b>Self-Control</b> - <b>Patience</b> - the most necessary trait in our modern age.</p><p><span class='ja'>定心</span> - <span class='ja'>存心</span> - <span class='ja'>正念</span> - <span class='ja'>正気に返れ</span> <i>joushin</i> - <i>zonshin</i> - <i>shounen</i> - <i>shouki ni kaere</i><br/><b>Meditation</b>, <b>Feelings from the heart</b>, and <b>True Faith</b>.  Meditation is the spirit of Buddhism.  You rid yourself of all distractions and focus your mind on a single thought.  You keep yourself in a free state, void of feeling, or a level feelings.  It's like a state of nothingness.  You try to achieve a state of zen.  True Faith is being able to control or correct your bad feelings, and bring in good feelings.</p><p><span class='ja'>怨望</span> - <span class='ja'>日本人の弱点</span> <i>enpou</i> - <i>nihonjin no jakuten</i><br/> <b>Envy</b> - a Japanese weakness.  The first kanji is also used for the verb <i>uramu</i> <span class='ja'>怨む</span>, which means to have a grudge against someone.  But, this boils down to resentment, jealousy.  There's a really common utterance in Japanese: <span class='ja'>いいな</span>.  Directly, it's translates as "that's good," or "that's awesome," but it carries a sense of wanting with it, like, "I want that to," or "I wish I had that, too."  I'm not sure if including this virtue is an example of something bad, or if it's just part of being Japanese, good or bad.</p><p><span class='ja'>勇</span> - <span class='ja'>肉体に根ざす徳</span> <i>yuu</i> - <i>nikutai ni nezasu toku</i><br/> <b>Bravery</b> or <b>Courage</b> - the fundamental trait that makes up the human body.</p><p><span class='ja'>仁</span> - <span class='ja'>生命のものの徳</span> <i>jin</i> - <i>seimei no mono mo toku</i><br/> <b>Benevolence</b> or consideration and compassion for other people.  Humanity.  This is the virtue of all existence and life in general.</p><p><span class='ja'>志</span> - <span class='ja'>人生の司令塔</span> <i>kokorozashi</i> - <i>jinsei no shireitou</i><br/> <b>Intention</b> or <b>Motive</b> - the central drive or direction that controls our lives, or your reason for doing the things you do.</p><p><span class='ja'>『教育勅語』の徳目</span> <i>[kyouiku chokugo] no tokume</i><br/><b>Types of virtues taken from the "Imperial Rescript of Education"</b>.  The Imperial Rescript was kind of like the Pledge of a Allegiance in the US.  It was something that all school children (prior to World War II) would read and say in school.  It requested that people advance public good and promote common interests, always respect the constitution and observe the laws, and should emergency arise, offer yourself to defend and maintain the prosperity of the Imperial Throne.  These days, Japanese people consider this nationalist train of thought dangerous as it lead to the mistakes of war.</p><div class='title'><b>The Objective of Self-improvement <span class='ja'>修養の目標</span></b></div><p><span class='ja'>男一匹</span> - <span class='ja'>新渡戸稲造の修養論</span> <i>otoko ippiki</i> - <i>Nitobe Inazou no shouyou ron</i><br/><b>The perfection of masculinity</b> - Nitobe Inazou's idea of self-improvement.  This is the ideal that every Japanese man wants to be.</p><p><span class='ja'>すてきなひと</span> - <span class='ja'>女性らしさの徳</span> <i>suteki na hito</i> - <i>josei rashisa no toku</i><br/><b>"Beautiful" Person</b> - feminine virtues.</p><p><span class='ja'>三種の神器</span> - <span class='ja'>政治家の徳</span> <i>sanshu no jingo</i> - <i>seijika no toku</i><br/><b>Three Sacred Treasures</b> - the virtues required of politicians.  These are honesty <span class='ja'>正直</span> <i>shoujiki</i>, compassion <span class='ja'>慈悲</span> <i>jihi</i>, and wisdom <span class='ja'>知恵</span> <i>chie</i>.</p><p><span class='ja'>老木の花</span> - <span class='ja'>亀の甲より年の功</span> <i>rouboku no hana</i> - <i>kame no koi yori toshi no koi</i><br/>(<b>Idioms</b>) The Flower of an Old Tree - wise old man wisdom from a turtle shell.  These are virtues found from idioms, or wise old sayings passed down by generations.  Heeding this wisdom shows respect to the elderly.</p><p><span class='ja'>無私</span> - <span class='ja'>徳の大きさ</span> <i>mushi</i> - <i>toku no okisa</i><br/><b>Nothingness</b> - the size of a virtue.</p><p><span class='ja'>中庸</span> -<span class='ja'>「普通」</span>- <span class='ja'>こそが究極の徳</span> <i>chuuyou</i> - <i>[futsuu]</i> - <i>koso ga kyuukyoku no toku</i><br/><b>The Golden Mean</b> - <b>Normality</b> or being average - virtues of the ultimate goal.  This is about sticking to the group, and not being extreme.  But, it can also mean being fair, and not taking sides.  Ultimately, this idea came from China.</p><div class='title'><b>Translation</b></div><p>The book is quite dense.  It'd be like a Japanese person trying to translate a bible into their language.  Some of these virtues deal with the roots of modern day Japanese culture stemming from China.  Others are wholly formed Japanese ideals.  One easy way to identify traits stemming directly from Japanese ideals are the words that use a single kanji.  Usually words with two or three kanji stem directly from Chinese kanji.</p><div class='title'><b>Balance</b></div><p>Out of everything, I found the topic of balancing strength and wisdom particularly important to me.  Not being able to fully understand Japanese (and perhaps the way they train junior high students) has made me miss a lot of the theory and thought process behind the moves and training I've done thus far.  Even the written test makes the test-takers only memorize the words written, but not actually think of their own answers.</p><p>The lecture on the following day mentioned that one cannot learn a budo art by training alone.  Someone who only trains technique and only builds physical strength and speed will never be on the same level as someone who balances training both their body and mind.</p><p>This conference was immensely valuable to me because of this.  It identified my largest weakness in learning kendo so far.  The idea of always training in kendo doesn't necessarily make you better at kendo.  Improving aspects of your life, and bringing balance to everything will improve your skills as well.</p><p>Good habits in your life are brought into your budo, just as the bad habits, too.  If you're a well-organized person, those ideals are brought into your performance.  If you're a slouch or a sloppy person, those ideals are also brought in, too.  Kendo and other budo arts are an expression of your inner self, and your moves and techniques mirror those ideals.  This is what your opponent sees when faced against you.  </p><p>And things I improve in kendo translate back in my life.  Kendo is no longer just something that I do.  Kendo is who am I.  It's a part of me.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 4, 2016<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">March 2016</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan">4</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/animation-cels-from-the-legend-of-crystania">15</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/other-locations-in-taiji">29</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/onigajo-cliff">30</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
