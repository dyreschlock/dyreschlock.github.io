Today, Kiyomi has 1 junior high school, and 1 elementary, but it used to have a whole lot more.</p><p>Last year, Kiyomi Junior High School celebrated its 50th year.  And this year, Kiyomi Elementary celebrates its 40th.  When both schools were opened, it was the consolidation of all the education in Kiyomi into a single building.</p><p>Back when I first started at Kiyomi, I spent a few days in the Library, and looked through books in their "local" section.  I found a book published by the City Council of Kiyomi that was basically the almanac of the village.  It details Kiyomi's agriculture, industry, demographics, and history.  There was a section of the book titled <span class='ja'>わたしの学校</span> (or "My School") which I found quite fascinated.  It had a timeline of all the schools that ever existed in Kiyomi village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, I present to you: The History of Kiyomi Schools.</p><p><i>Much of the general historical information was taken from Wikipedia.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Meiji Period</b></div><p>The earliest schools in Kiyomi date all the way back near the beginning of the Meiji period.  <span class='ja'>明治</span>6, 7, and 8 marked the beginning of Kiyomi's 6 major schools.  That's 1873, 1874, and 1875.</p><p>The Meiji period marked the beginning of Japan's restoration to bring themselves out of their feudal society and into the modern world that was way more advanced than they were.  Education was one of the biggest concerns in the country.  In 1871, the Ministry of Education was established with a school system closely based on the United States.  They created elementary, middle, normal, and university school systems.</p><p>Elementary schools taught primary education are were meant to create loyal subjects to the Emperor of Japan.  Middle schools were secondary education, and were basically the equivalent of a High School.  They were to prepare students to enter Universities, and the Universities were to create students into leaders and modernize Japan.  Normal schools were training schools for graduates of middle schools who wanted to become teachers. </p><p>By 1900, Enrollment in public schools was 90%, whereas the start of the Meiji era only had 50%.<br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>At this time, the 6 schools in Kiyomi were:</p><p><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>まきがほら</span> / Makigahora<br/><span class='ja'>福奇尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>ふくより</span> / Fukuyori<br/><span class='ja'>巣野俣尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>すのまた</span> / Sunomata<br/><span class='ja'>夏厩尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>なつうまや</span> / Natsuumaya<br/><span class='ja'>池本尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>いけもと</span> / Ikemoto<br/><span class='ja'>大原尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>おっぱら</span> / Oppara</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>Kiyomi had 2 branch schools, too:</p><p><span class='ja'>森茂分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>もりも</span> / Morimo<br/><span class='ja'>楢谷分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>ならだに</span> / Naradani</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Each school (and branch school) is named after the neighborhood it resides it.</p><p>The official declaration of a school was <span class='ja'>尋常小学校</span>.  <span class='ja'>尋常</span> or <span class='ja'>じんじょう</span> translates as public, or common.  <span class='ja'>小学校</span> (<span class='ja'>しょうがっこ</span>) is elementary school.  Branch schools were <span class='ja'>分教場</span> (<span class='ja'>ぶんきょうじょう</span>).</p><p>Higher education became increasingly important as Japan continued to industrialize.  In 1904, in Kiyomi, Makigahora, Fukuyori, and Natsuumaya all changed their designation to <span class='ja'>尋常高等小学校</span> adding the <span class='ja'>高等</span> into their names.  <span class='ja'>高等</span>, or <span class='ja'>こうとう</span>, stands for "high class."  It's also the same word used for Senior High School <span class='ja'>高等学校</span>.</p><p>In 1907, elementary school attendance was made mandatory.  From now on, all children in Japan were required to have 6 years of primary education.  Middle schools were only required for students who wanted to go to a university, or normal school.</p><div class='title'><b>Taisho Period</b></div><p>In 1912, Emperor Meiji passed away, and Taisho became the new emperor.  The educational system became even more centralized, but there were plenty of good things that happened.  The Extraordinary Council on Education was created in 1917 and set forth many reforms.  Many more private colleges were now officially recognized.  Subsidies were introduced for poor families so their children could attend schools.</p><p>Education started to become much more militaristic, too.  And Japan started using a lot of educational ideas from Germany to instill the ideas of nationalism, patriotism, and militarization.</p><div class='title'><b>Showa Period</b></div><p>Nationalism and Militarization continued as Japan entered World War II.  In 1941, the educational system renamed all of its schools to <span class='ja'>国民学校</span> (<span class='ja'>こくみんがっこ</span>), which means National People's Schools.  This is taken from the German language.  Nation People's School translates as Volksschule, which is interesting, too.  Schule is School in German.  Volks stands for "people of", "national", etc.  The name Volkswagen makes a lot of sense now.</p><p>The elementary schools now required mandatory military training.  The principles of education now taught traditional, political, religious, and moral values.  Every day was to serve the Empire of Japan.  Every school in Japan turned into a cult of worship building loyal soldiers to die for their country.</p><div class='title'><b>Post-War</b></div><p>In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, and the educational system of Japan had collapsed.  As the United States occupied Japan and rebuilt it, there were several specific missions sent to rebuild the educational system.</p><p>One of these new reforms was to recreate the division between the levels of schooling to resemble the US.</p><p>Before now, elementary education was 6 years, secondary education was 3 years, and higher education (university) was 4 years.  Only elementary schools were mandatory.  The reforms now created two tiers of secondary education: lower and upper, and made lower secondary education mandatory for all students.</p><p>This created the following:</p><p><span class='ja'>小学校</span> - Elementary Schools - Elementary education for 6 years.  (required)<br/><span class='ja'>中学校</span> - Junior High Schools - Lower Secondary education for 3 years. (required)<br/><span class='ja'>高等学校</span> - Senior High Schools - Upper Secondary education for 3 years.<br/><span class='ja'>大学校</span> - University - Higher education for 4 years</p><p>The year <span class='ja'>昭和</span>22, or 1947, was the first year to follow the new law.  This is the system that Japan follows today.  Even though Senior High Schools are not required, 94% of junior high school graduates apply and enter high school.  And more than 95% of students graduate.  (As of 2005)</p><p><div class="title">Kiyomi Village</div><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>In 1947, the 6 major schools turned into the following:</p><p><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞中小学校</span> / Makigahora JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>福奇中小学校</span> / Fukuyori JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>巣野俣中小学校</span> / Sunomata JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>夏厩中小学校</span> / Natsuumaya JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>池本中小学校</span> / Ikemoto JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>大原中小学校</span> / Oppara JHS+ES</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>And there were now 4 branch schools</p><p> <span class='ja'>池本中小森茂分校</span> / Ikemoto JHS+ES (Morimo Branch)<br/><span class='ja'>上小島分校</span> / Kami Odori Branch School<br/><span class='ja'>小島山分校</span> / Odori Mountain Branch School<br/><span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span> / Naradani Branch School</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Even though, the grades were separated, the Junior High and elementary schools still operated in the same building.</p><p>I found a book in my local library that listed the attendance for each of these schools starting in <span class='ja'>昭和</span>30, or 1955.  Combining the attendance at each school, there were 373 junior high school students, and 750 elementary students in that year.</p><p>The population of Kiyomi was decreasing, and the world was getting smaller with advancements in automobiles, and other forms of travel.</p><p>With the junior high school system in place, all schools across Japan began making separate buildings for junior high students only.  In 1962, construction began for a single building in all of Kiyomi that would unite the junior high students under one roof.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> / Kiyomi Junior High School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" /></p><p>In <span class='ja'>昭和</span>38, or 1963, Kiyomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> opened for its first school year, and all the junior high school students in Kiyomi village now attended this school.  Both Morimo Branch School <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>, and Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> still served some junior high students, but only in the winter when traveling to Kiyomi JHS was too difficult.  For Junior High, both schools operat as branch schools of Kiyomi JHS, whereas for elementary, they operated as branch schools of the nearby elementaries.</p><p>Also, Kiyomi JHS had an attached dormitory.  During the winter months, and throughout the year, students would be able to live at the school rather than make the journey home.</p><p>In its first year, the graduating class of Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> was 126 students, which were split between 3 classes at school.  The Junior High had an attached dormitory, so students from the distant areas of Kiyomi lived at school for the whole week before returning home for the weekend.</p><p>I think it became a real point of pride for Kiyomi when the junior high school opened.  For the first time in its history, all the village's students attended the same school, and had classes together.  It really brought everyone together, and became a symbol for the community of Kiyomi.</p><div class='title'><b>Consolidation</b></div><p>A few years after Kiyomi JHS opened, the lingering branch schools began closing and filtering their students into the junior high school, and existing official nearby elementary schools.  Though, this was also more likely because the more remote regions of Kiyomi were no longer self-sustaining, and people were moving into the more populated areas.</p><p>The Sunomata ES <span class='ja'>巣野俣小</span> building closed in 1965, and all their students now went to Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span>.  And with the closure of Sunomata, the Naradani Branch School <span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span> closed, too.  Any students in Naradani probably just went to Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span>.</p><p>The Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> changed it's name to Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>冬期分校</span> in 1965.  <span class='ja'>冬期</span> or <span class='ja'>とうき</span> is Japanese for Winter Term, so I'm guessing this school was only used in the winter to relieve the students of the dangerous daily journey to school.  It stayed open for another 3 years, and closed for good in 1968.</p><p>Also, in 1968, the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span> of Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span> closed.</p><p>Kiyomi now had 5 operating elementary schools, and one distant branch school (Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>).  Until…</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> / Kiyomi Elementary School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" /></p><p>In 1974, or <span class='ja'>昭和</span>49, as the population of Kiyomi continued to decrease by the younger generation moving away to more prosperous areas of Takayama, construction of Kiyomi Elementary School <span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> was complete.  Makigahora ES <span class='ja'>牧ケ洞小</span>, Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span> both closed and their students now attended Kiyomi ES.  Natsuumaya ES <span class='ja'>夏厩小</span> closed as well, and those students filtered into Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>.</p><p>The two most distant schools, Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span> and Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>, continued to operate after Kiyomi ES was open.</p><p>The Morimo Branch <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span> finally closed, too, on the eve of Kiyomi ES's opening.  I think the final remaining residents of that neighborhood finally moved closer in Kiyomi, or another neighboring area.  Which left Morimo completely uninhabited.</p><p>10 years later, in 1984, Ikemoto ES closed its doors, and its students went to Kiyomi ES.  And then, finally, in 2003, Opara ES closed, too.  </p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>And that brings us to today.  Since then, Kiyomi village has only two schools, Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> and Kiyomi ES <span class='ja'>清見小</span>.  Both of which all students in Kiyomi attend.</p><p>It's really hard to believe that Kiyomi JHS could actually hold 126 students in each class.  Today, each class has 23 to 27 students.  The population decline in Japan is very real, and it's very apparent when you start viewing the historical records in the schools.  Each year, graduating classes get a little bit smaller, and a little bit smaller.
