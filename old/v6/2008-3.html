To date, there has only been one ocassion where I left the establishment satisfied, which was around two years ago when Richard Divine tore up the place (<a href="/old/v6/richard-divine-inferno" title="/richard-divine-inferno">here what i wrote</a>).  The other two times at Inferno had been a stark disappointment.  Extremely low turn-outs..</p><p>When arriving at Inferno around 9:45pm, it seemed like I was being setup for disappointment again.  There were maybe a dozen or two people there, most of which were sipping drinks at the bar.  There was one group that was quite into the scene and were on the dance floor.</p><p>Brett and I found a table off to the side and perched ourselves for the night.  Despite having few people around, the track selection was absolutely amazing.  80s dance hit after 80s dance hit.  Amazing song I never remember this well, to several great songs I had never heard before.</p><p>DJ Smitty was the resident all night long and he kep the hits coming along.  His track selection was top notch.  Unfortunately though, he didn't mix any tracks together at all.  When one song ended, it was a quick to the next.  It was like getting punched in the side or pushed into a wall at the end of every song.  ughh..</p><p>I never got used to his hard cuts, but what can you do really?  The genre is 'retro' which covers ALL genres of dance from the 80s and other eras.  Track mixing really didn't become all that prevalent until the 90s..  I would've liked some effort but towards mixing, but all these songs are so radically different, it would probably be disastrous if you weren't already a mixing god.  Oh well...</p><p>The track selection made the night perfect, and as the night went on..  more and more people did begin to show up and started flocking to the dance floor.  The power of delicious 80s tracks truly did bring people into the venue despite Spring Break and a Snow Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080321_inferno/IMG_0048.webp" /></p><p>This event was the highest viewed for the month of March on Inferno's website, so I really wonder what kind of crowds this'll draw when it's not Spring Break and the weather is fine.  80s Night at Inferno is the 3rd Friday of each month, so I guess we'll see next time on April 18th.</p><p>April 18th also happens to be No Brand Con, so I won't be able to get any SPAMM friends to go, but if you aren't going up to Eau Claire that weekend, feel free to stop by Madison, ^_^</p><p>Favorite Track of the Night: Ghostbusters Theme ^_^.  Unfortunately, we didn't stay long enough for Smitty to play my request of the Beverly Hills Cop Theme.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 23, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 19, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Mass Effect - Bring down the Sky</h3><p>Last week, Bioware released the first in a series of downloadable episodes for Mass Effect on the Xbox 360.  Being an adoring fan of Mass Effect I quickly purchased this new $5 episode and finally finished the 3 hour episode a week and a half later.</p><p>Bring down the Sky is a pluggable episode that squeezes itself into the middle of Mass Effect.  It takes place on Asteroid X57 near Terra Nova in the something cluster, which you can reach once you get free rein to explore the Milky Way Galaxy.  You can not access this once you've completed the game, which could be considered a pain in the ass to some players.  It took me about 3 or 4 hours to run through Eden Prime and all the required crap on the Citadel to finally start flying around.</p><p>That's the main reason why I didn't finish Bring down the Sky in one sitting.  All my free time that night was spent getting to the point where I could start it.  Also, I was playing on the insane difficulty, so some things took a little longer than usual.</p><p>In Bring down the Sky, you are faced with a Batarian regime who have taken over the science facilities on Asteroid X57 and have changed the trajectory to collide with Terra Nova, whose colonies consist of some 6 million inhabitants.  Once landed on the asteroid, you can see the brilliant Terra Nova as you loom closer to doom.  It reminds me a lot of Armageddon, actually.  Luckily, you don't need to drill through the surface and destroy the asteroid.  You just need to shut of the thrusters and regain control of the science facilities to fix everything.</p><p>This expansion does feature a couple new Assets to Mass Effect.  The large thrusters bored into the asteroid are new from the download, as well as the Batarians themselves.  We never did get to see the Batarians in the main game, but this expansion does offer reasons why they were left out.</p><p>Overall, Bring down the sky is more robust than the other side quests already in the game.  The experience is tighter and self-contained with actual cutscenes throughout the experience leading you on to the next station.  It has a more theatrical introduction and conclusion, but still keeps a sandbox approach to how you handle the outcome.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>The only complaint I have about Bring down the Sky is the ending.  It really annoys me that you are given 2 choices at the end and you can only do one or the other.  You cannot defeat the extremist leader AND save the hostages he's acquired.  You can do this in all other scenarios throughout the game, but you cannot in this one.  AND, to make matters worse, during the epilogue to the episode, everyone keeps second guessing your choices.</p><p>So, not only can't you do both, but the game judges either decision you make as the wrong one.  I even went back and saved the hostages the second time rather than killing the leader and they STILL are ungrateful.  ARHghaghghgh</p><p>You pay $5 for a few hours of entertainment and there's no scenario where the game won't complain about what you've done.  Maybe I'll go back and kill the hostages again just to shut them up.  At least I get Renegade points for that.. I don't get Paragon points for saving the hostages.<br/>/Spoilers</p><p>Anyways, I'd definitely recommend this if you like Mass Effect and have already completed one play through.  You don't need to beat the game to play this, but if you haven't finished Mass Effect, you should probably do that before you add more content to extend the game.</p><p>Also, Bring down the sky gives you another 50 achievement points ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Coming back to Mass Effect</b></div><p>Coming back into Mass Effect from playing World of Warcraft these past few months was a much needed breath of fresh air.  WOW is so completed void of emotion, it almost completely numbs me to play.  It has tremendous back story and all that, but that's not the point of WOW at all.  WOW is all about the end game level of play, reaching 70 and then actually building your character.  and continuing to build your character.</p><p>There's really no aspect of playing the game how you want because the point is to "be good" at it, and if you don't do little things how you're supposed, everyone starts complaining to you about it.  "You're in the wrong zone", "You're doing worthless quests", "Abandon all those crappy quests", "Put out your buffs", "Why do you have one point in another skill tree".</p><p>I feel no freedom in the game.  I'm really just a slave to how the game is played well.  Which is absolutely the opposite of what I want from an MMO.</p><p>Maybe it's just because I hang out with people who've played the game for the past 4 years its been in the market though, but I constantly miss the type of freedom I felt when playing Ultima Online.  I felt no pressure to do anything in Ultima Online.  I could just run off into the woods and be a hermit if I wanted.  I could build a shack in the woods, outfit it with fencer training stuff and buff my character that way.  I could actually explore the world where no one had ever been, and monsters were very sparse.</p><p>I really can't play World of Warcraft that much anymore..  It's too annoying and gives me a headache whenever I think about it.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, about Mass Effect</b></div><p>Anywho, I started a new game in Mass Effect to be able to play Bring down the Sky.  This is my third play through and I started off on my level 59 character, which was still 100,000 experience away from the game's level cap.  Through the first areas of the game I got up to 792,000, still 68,000 short of the cap.  After finishing the new episode I'm at 820,000, still 40,000 from the cap.  Sigh...</p><p>Also, my game is now on the Insane difficulty which is actually challenging!  It's actually pretty fun to actual use parts of the environment for cover and not being able to run in the middle of battle and kill everyone.  Each skirmish takes a little tact to fish out the enemies into the open to beat them down.  Moving around your party members is actually helpful!  Sweet.  Too bad is takes 50 hours into the game to unlock it.</p><p>I don't see why you have to unlock the more difficult difficulties when the options you have are pretty easy in the first place.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 19, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 9, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Gyakuten Saiban / Ace Attorney Timeline</h3><p>If you've played through any Phoenix Wright game, you may notice that Date and Time stamped onto the beginning of every scene in the game.  When playing through these games.. I wonder..  is it really consistent?</p><p>In the 2nd one, Wright says he's been a lawyer for one year.  In the third one, he's says he's been a lawyer for two years.  So the first 3 games take place a year apart.  And Apollo Justice comes into the scene seven years later.  The third games deals a lot with events both past and present for the whole series.  Apollo Justice does a fair amount of flash-backing too, but it sticks to that 7 year period after the first three games.</p><p>They never really say what year it is though..  but there is one piece of evidence in the entire franchise that places a year on one event, which in turn places a year on all events.  That's the good 'ol DL-6 Incident file from the fourth case of the first game.  The DL-6 Incident took place on December 28th, 2001, 15 years prior to the fourth case.  So Phoenix Wright 1 begins in 2016, Phoenix Wright 2 in 2017, Phoenix Wright 3 in 2018 and 2019, with Apollo Justice in the year 2026.  Weird..  but it makes sense with all the futuristic crap that is subtley put into some cases..  like Godot's visor.</p><p>Anyways, I made a list of events in Gyakuten Saiban series with when they took place and with whom.</p><p><b>UPDATE (9/28/2010)</b>: I'm playing through Ace Attorney Edgeworth or Gyakuten Kenji at the moment, so I'm updating this time line as I go.<br/>_______</p><p>December 28th, 2001<br/><b>DL-6 Incident</b> -

thought dump</h3><p>Last Night, I completed Apollo Justice, the fourth game in the Ace Attorney / Phoenix Wright / Gyakuten Saiban game series.  I have some disappointments, but overall I'm quite pleased with the game.</p><p><b>Timeshift</b> (spoiler-heavy)</p><p>The riskiest thing about the game is playing as Apollo Justice, 7 years past the previous game.  This offers a very healthy restart to the franchise and takes the series in a new direction.  Honestly, I think they had exhausted all their options with Edgeworth and the Fey family.  It was time for the series to move forward, rather than backward.  But I think they put a little too much behind them when making this transition.</p><p>Phoenix Wright is in Apollo Justice and is the center of attention, but many of the other characters are gone.  Not a single mention of Edgeworth or the Fey Family.  No Franziska, No Gumshoe.  The only other 'blast from the past' is Ema Skye who was introduced in the DS only chapter of Phoenix Wright 1.  She has taken Gumshoe's place as lead detective.</p><p>I guess it's assumed that Edgeworth and Maya went their merry way elsewhere.  Pearl, too.  I'd like to know what happened.  Maybe that will be the focus of Gyakuten Saiban 5?</p><p><b>New Main Character</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>The thing reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid 2.  Phoenix Wright is still in the game, but he's like a mentor / background character for the better part of the game.  It's not until the final chapter, when you play as him, that his whole story takes center stage and shows exactly how Apollo Justice is caught up in it.  Kinda like MGS2.  You start off as Snake, but his story is cut short.  Then all of sudden, you're playing as Raiden and have no idea why until it all becomes clear in the final act.</p><p>I have a feeling Gyakuten Saiban 5 is going to be a lot like MGS4 or perhaps Halo 3, where you have the main characters of the franchise side-by-side using their detective and analytic techniques together.</p><p><b>Perceiving</b> (some spoilers)</p><p>Speaking of which.. Phoenix Wright's detection vice was using the Magatama and discovering Psyche-Locks in people.  Locks that locked memories from the people view that you can unlock by shoving truth into their faces.  Unlocking those memories helped you dig deeper into the truth.</p><p>Apollo Justice has a vice of his own, Perceiving, which, just like the Magatama, is integral to his character's story.  To perceive, Apollo will feel tension in his bracelet which gives him the idea that this person is lying to him.  When perceiving, you look VERY closely at your subject.  You search them for a 'tell' or 'habit' they might do when they're lying.  Once you know exactly what they're lying about, you can use evidence or coercion to force the truth out of them.</p><p>In this game, the only time you perceive is in court.  There is never an instance outside of court that the game allows you to perceive.  But that's where the Magatama comes into play in the final act when uncovering all the mysteries of the past 7 years.</p><p><b>In the series..</b> (no real spoilers)</p><p>Overall, I was quite pleased with the game.  Even though, it missed the mark of the previous characters in the series, it did a great job pulling Apollo Justice and other new characters into the series.  I'm still somewhat annoyed at those chapters that aren't relevant to the overall story, though.  In this case, the second chapter really had nothing to do with the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  Though, I guess it did bring back Ema Skye and plenty of forensic investigation.</p><p>Placing it into the series, though.  I would say Apollo Justice is on par with the first Phoenix Wright game.  Phoenix Wright 3 is my favorite, whereas Phoenix Wright 2 is my least favorite.  Don't get me wrong, Phoenix Wright 2 is essential for the overall story of Gyakuten Saiban, but the music really pulls down the game.  You need to play Phoenix Wright 2 to appreciate all the story in Phoenix Wright 3.</p><p>Apollo Justice is kind of on its own plane though.  You don't really need to play the previous games to appreciate the story.  You could start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice and not be lost or miss anything.  All you'd really need to know is that Phoenix Wright is a good, clever lawyer.</p><p>Though, if you did start Gyakuten Saiban at Apollo Justice, you'd totally be spoiled by the 3D aspects.  I would rather hold Apollo Justice as a treat for playing through the first 3 games, than go start for the desert.</p><p><b>Gyakuten Saiban</b> (no spoilers)</p><p>After completing Apollo Justice, I still want more.  I love the characters, the story, the humor, the music.  The whole domestic version of the Gyakuten Saiban series is fantastic.  If you haven't played through them, I ask that you give it another try. ^_^  These 4 games are some of the best the DS has the offer.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 5 is at the top of my hype-wagon ^_^.</p><div class='title'><b><em>Update</em></b></div><p>After peering around, I found some news on Gyakuten Saiban 5.</p><p><em>When Shu Takumi was exclusively interviewed, he said that GS5 will still be on DS and it will be the last one for the series. However, it doesn't mean that there will be no new GS games, but rather the end of stories about Phoenix. After that, GS will become a totally new game and have nothing to do with the old series.</em></p><p><em>He also stated that GS4 was a "test" game. Thanks to the high sale record of GS4, the staff aren't worried about introducing a new story.</em></p><p><em>However, before the new game series can start, the current GS series must come to an end and GS5 will be the farewell show. GS5 will break the record of GS1's DS remake and become the longest one of the whole series. Almost all the old characters will turn up and some hidden clues in GS1234 will be looked on. Some of the cases which seem to have nothing to do with each other will show a connection. In a word, everything will become clear in GS5. What made the players even more excited, Shu Takumi revealed that the final boss of the all darkness is not a fresh face but someone we are quite familiar with! This person control all in the dark, who can he/she be?</em></p><p><em>Shu Takumi also said the most of the script has been finished and the game producing is on its way. There is also a piece of news which may let the players down: it's probably the last time that Shu Takumi will take part in writing the script for GS. From now on, other people will take over his work.</em></p><p>It seems like suspicions are correct.  Number 5 will tie everything together, but it seems it will also end it all.  Oh well.  Rather put a definite end to a story rather than dragging it out forever.  I can't wait ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 9, 2008<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">March 2008</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/gyakuten-saiban-ace-attorney-timeline">9</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/mass-effect-bring-down-the-sky">19</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/80s-prom-porn-inferno">23</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
