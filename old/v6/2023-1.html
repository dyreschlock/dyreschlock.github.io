I started playing Pokemon Go in the beginning in 2016, but I didn’t really seriously start playing it until 2018, and I started a second account and played them both at the same time. My primary account was ahead of my secondary, but it didn’t take long for it to catch up and have pokemon teams just as powerful. After a few months, both accounts were essentially mirrors of each other.</p><p>By the end of 2020, my primary account was able to hit level 40, but my secondary account still lagged behind.  In order to reach level 40, you need a total of 20 million XP in the game. I think my primary was at 25 million at that point? And my secondary may have been at 18 million.</p><p>With the increased level caps set, you’ll now need a total of 176 million XP to reach level 50. In fact, the gap between level 49 and level 50 alone with 30 million XP. With these requirements and my current progress, I resigned myself that it would take years upon years to actually get there.</p><p>In the end, it only took 2 years and a month.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">DyreSchlock - Jan 29th<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_50_230129.webp" /></div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - Jan 31st<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_50_230131.webp" /></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>Both of my accounts hit level 50 last week after a long 7 months of being stuck on level 49.  In addition to needed XP to gain a level, you also have unique level requirements, like hatching some amount of eggs, or defeating some amount of rocket members. Level 49 requires you land 1000 excellent throws on Pokemon, which is very time consuming and annoying if you don’t manually play so often. I was able to grind them out with the most recent Electric event, though.</p><p>So, if it took me more than two years prior to 2021 to gain 20 million XP, how was I able to get more than 150 million in just two years? Overall, 3 main factors contributed to my XP, but a few other things also changed how I played.</p><div class='title'><b>XP Gains</b></div><p>First, as the level cap was raised, so was the XP you gain for doing various things in the game. Catching Pokemon gave you a little more. Spinning stops gave you a little bit. Defeating Raid bosses gave you a little more. And, most notably, excellent throws now gave you 1000xp.  Before, I think it was 200xp.</p><p>Second, additionally, evolving Pokemon now gave you 1000xp, too. Throughout the weeks, as I caught a lot of Pokemon, if I could evolve them, I would put them into their own group. There are many Pokemon in the game, and many of these Pokemon are not useful in battles. Because of this, I’d just throw them away to make room to catch more. But, if I have a lot of candy for those Pokemon, may as well make them useful by evolving them for the XP. When you use a Lucky Egg, you’ll get double XP for the next 30 minutes. AND! I logged into a single account using both of my phones. I could evolve double the amount of Pokemon and get double the amount of XP. <b>In 30 minutes, I could get about 750 thousand XP</b>. I caught enough Pokemon that I could do this every 2 or 3 weeks.</p><p>Thirdly, the absolute best way to get XP in the game is through friendships. After 7 days, 30 days, and 90 days, you’ll increase your friendship level for 10 thousand, 50 thousand, and 100 thousand XP. Use a Lucky Egg to double it. Making friends in Pokemon go wasn’t easy to begin with, but it became very easy when they introduced Remote Raids. Other people built match making apps where you friend each other to do raids. After hosting MANY MANY raids, I continue to send gifts to people and increase friendships. Every 2 or 3 weeks when I did evolves, I would get the XP from friendships, too. After one of these sessions, I would routinely make around 1.5 million. One night, I made more than 5 million.</p><div class='title'><b>Play Style</b></div><p>Those were specific things I did to significantly increase my level, but overall, my play style is much different than it was prior to 2021 and the game has changed a lot, too.</p><p>The main way my play style changed was using these two things:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/IMG_0237_t.webp" /></p><p>The Pokeball Plus was released in 2018 with the release of Let's Go Pikachu / Eevee, and meant to be used as a controller, but you could also connect it to Pokemon Go. When connected it will automatically spin stops for you. Also, when you're near a Pokemon you can click the button to try to catch it. Well, if you buy those rubber protectors above and shove a coin or two over the button, the button will automatically be pressed down and it will automatically catch a Pokemon.</p><p>With these two Pokeballs, I can turn on Pokemon Go, turn on the Pokeballs, and it will automatically capture Pokemon as I drive around town. This is an amazing efficient way of getting a lot of Pokemon very quickly and catching a lot of Pokemon that I wouldn't have caught otherwise. It's not a 100% catch rate, but it's still doing a lot more work than I would have to do manually, and it frees me up to focus on driving and moving around.</p><p>As time goes on, the radius that allows you to spin stops was increased and the overall number of pokemon that spawn has increased, too. I'm catching far more Pokemon than I ever had before.</p><div class='title'><b>Level History</b></div><p>It didn't take too long for both of my accounts to go through level 41, 42, 43, etc. Once I hit the mid-40s, I would take about a month or two or three to make it to the next level before I finally hit level 49. Each time you gain a level past 40, you have the option of saving your stat sheet, so I saved all of these images when I could.  Here are my past few levels as a comparison.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column">DyreSchlock - June 12th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_49_220612.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - June 16th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_49_220616.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column">DyreSchlock - March 29th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_48_220329.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - May 7th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_48_220507.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column">DyreSchlock - Dec 25th 2021<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock_47_211225.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div><div class="column twoColumnLast" >DyreSchlock2 - Feb 26th 2022<br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230131_pokemon/dyreschlock2_47_220226.webp" /><br class=“clr” />&nbsp;</div></div><br class="clr" /></p><div class='title'><b>End Game</b></div><p>Maybe they'll increase the level cap again in the future, but I doubt it. There's no real benefit of having your character reach level 50 compared with level 40. Once you hit level 35, you can boost your individual Pokemon to level 50, so it doesn't matter what level you are.</p><p>Lately, I've been playing Pokemon Go more casually and only focusing on certain events. Part of the reason it took me 7 months to gain a level was because I was barely playing the game. It's always fun to explore around town playing Pokemon Go, but with one less goal overall, it is one less reason to play, and that's a good thing. I can focus on other stuff instead.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 31, 2023<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">January 26, 2023</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Car Mileage</h3><p>Every 2 years in Japan, cars must go through a vehicle inspection called <I>Shaken</I>. This is to ensure that the cars are still safe to drive and that they haven't been illegally modified. It's usually costs at least $1000, which is annoying, but it's even more annoying when you have a bunch of repair costs tacked on top of it.</p><p>When I arrived in Japan, I had to buy a car because public transportation up in the mountains was not feasible. The car mechanic in town had a pretty good deal on a 2004 <b>Subaru R2</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0017_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The Subaru R2 is a Kei car, denoted by its yellow plate. Kei cars are smaller and have smaller engines. This also means they get some pretty great gas mileage.  I bought the car in 2013, but as <I>Shaken</I> loomed in 2021, the bottom plating had begun to erode away and it was no longer road-worthy. My mechanic information me that the repairs would be too much, and I should buy a new car. I had a bunch of money saved up from stimulus checks and not traveling due to lockdown, so it wasn't too bad.</p><p>My mechanic and I went through a bunch of cars on the open market, and I finally settled on a 2017 <b>Daihatsu Mira ES</b>. I wanted to continue owning a Subaru, but they discontinued their line of Kei cars, and Daihatsu has purchased their designs. The Mira is a slight evolution of the R2 mixed with Daihatsu designs.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230126_car/IMG_0415_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I went with Red to try and set myself apart from the conformity of all the White, Off-White, and Grey cars of Japan. Nobody likes colors in their cars over here. It's still not completely unique, though, as the Mira ES is one of the most popular Kei cars on the road. I think that's good because it'll be easy to find replacement parts in the future if stuff breaks.

Many times I drove to Tokyo, too. Throughout its life, it had an average of 32.93 or 33.67 mpg, after conversions from liters and km. Towards the end, it started losing some of its mpg, and after Covid started, I was really only driving around town.</p><p>Here are the full stats on my <b>Subaru R2</b>:<br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEUeqESvioxxYmGwsYPkDsx453hCRjZDRJQlesGGBvI" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEUeqESvioxxYmGwsYPkDsx453hCRjZDRJQlesGGBvI">Google Sheets</a></p><p>I have continued to do gas accounting with my <b>Daihatsu Mira ES</b>.

Judgment is a new game from Ryu Ga Gotoku studios (makers of the Yakuza game series). It was a bit long, but follows the adventures of Yagami, a former Lawyer, now private detective. You go around real-Tokyo-location Kabukicho trying to uncover a conspiracy of murders and their connections to the Yakuza and Police. It was a pretty great experience with a few unexpected twists. The story is completely standalone and concludes in the end.</p><p>The sequel is a new adventure and new case that Yagami follows. You also go to a new location in Yokohama. The story is about a murder involving a high school. While the story isn't as important as the first game, visiting the school and talking with students and teachers is pretty fun. Ultimately, I did not finish it.</p><div class='title'><b>Nintendo</b></div><p>I played through the Judgment games at the beginning of the year, but once Pokemon Legends was released in February, it was the only thing I played for months, and I never really returned to Playstation after that.</p><p>The reason <b>Pokemon Legends Arceus</b> is one of the best Pokemon games of all time is the freedom of movement, the fast paced method of catching and collecting Pokemon, and the sense of exploration through the uncharted world. One of my favorite things about Pokemon is completing the Pokedex, and the main story goal of Legends is to do just that. It's so fun.</p><p>After playing the game for month, I went back to <b>Let's Go Eevee</b> to clean up more shiny Pokemon I had yet to capture. I bought a turbo controller to automate trading for shiny Alolan pokemon.</p><p>And, in November, <b>Pokemon Scarlet / Violet</b> were released.  Again, I played the game from nearly sun up to sun down. It was a much more expansive experience than Sword and Shield, but unfortunately took none of the lessons from Pokemon Legends. In fact, it's a far worse experience in almost every way. The performance is terrible where it can take up to 4 seconds for some pokemon to spawn in. There's only a visual indication on whether or not a pokemon is shiny, so you really have to pay attention when shiny hunting. Movement is a bit slower compared with Legends, too.</p><p>But, Scarlet and Violet are still quite excellent. I would put them in the upper tier of Pokemon games.</p><p>Anyways, here are my stats for the year:</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/top_2022/nintendo_switch_2022_most_played_numbers.webp" /></a></p><p>The individual stats above I thought were the most informative and interesting.
