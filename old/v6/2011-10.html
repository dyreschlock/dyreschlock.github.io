I'm definitely a fan of the first game, Arkham Aslyum.  It was surprising, and fantastic, and felt like it came out of no where.  Again...  expectations.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham Asylum</b></div><p>I'm not sure if anyone was expecting something great when they first tried out Arkham Asylum, but I always kept reality in check.  There had never really been a <i>Good</i> game made from a comic book IP.  At least, not a mainstream game.  These type of games are usually just IP fodder.  Some random company is contracted for a Batman game, or a Superman game, or a Spiderman game.  They shit it out, and make money on the name recognition.  Kids buy these games in droves!</p><p>But Arkham Asylum was totally different.  It was a true to form modern Metroidvania style game.  The world you explored was small, tight, and as you progressed through the game, the new abilities and techniques you acquired help you access areas you hadn't previously had access to.  Though, power ups were unlocked through story progression, instead of exploration.  There were many secrets that required some backtracking and using your new gadgets.</p><p>All the gadgets and weapons made sense for the character of Batman, and in the context of exploring and getting to new areas.  It worked perfectly.</p><p>The story was kinda kooky, but made sense given the ridiculous nature of most comic book stories.  It wasn't necessarily trying to be realistic.  </p><p>The villains and their motivations were what brought everything together.  What happens when you get all of your enemies together in one place?  Some form an alliance, some are enemies to each other, some you stay away from, and some just pop when it's the most convenient for them.  Arkham Asylum was incredibly consistent with how the villains would react to each other, and to Batman as he infiltrated the compound.</p><p>There were plenty of interesting set pieces as well.  Like Scarecrow warping Batman's mind, or Joker capturing Batman is recreating the opening credits, but with the roles reversed.</p><p>My expectations were always reserved though, so whenever something amazing happened, I was surprised and delighted.</p><div class='title'><b>Arkham City</b></div><p>I think for Arkham City, I was waiting for something interesting to happen, and then nothing really did.  It really is just more of the same.</p><p>The story is still okay.  The gadgets are pretty much the same.  Combat is more fluid and fun.  There are 400 Riddler trophies now, instead of 100 in the first game.</p><p>The overworld is about 4 times the size of Arkham Asylum, but it feels really small.  You can only enter just a hand full of buildings.  And when you're in the city, you're usually just gliding from one building to the next.  You aren't really doing anything interesting expect looking for Riddler trophies, or hunting down some random thing for a side quest.  This basically makes Arkham City more like a GTA or Infamous, rather than Arkham Asylum which felt more like Metroid or Zelda.</p><p>There are more villains this time, but it follows the same scheme as the first game.  The heavy hitters are vie for territory in the city, and act appropriately to each other.  Sometimes you are randomly ambushed by those villains who prefer to work alone.  And others form alliances, and blackmail each other.  Not every villain is an actual villain though, which was a nice touch.</p><p>Overall, Arkham City is pretty good and it's fun, but...  it's not really doing anything new.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 31, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 31, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Beer Label Magnets</h3><p>Now that I'm living in a larger space, I actually have room to do some random arts &amp; crafts.</p><p>I adopted an idea that my little brother has been doing for a while.  We're both pretty big fans of beer, and he collects a lot of beer related things, such as bottle caps and labels.  He takes these things and makes magnets out of them, which completely coats his fridge.</p><div class='title'><b>Collect Beer!</b></div><p>It's a neat idea, and with the Oktoberfest season looming, I decided to gather up as many local Oktoberfest brews as I could.  I started doing the second week in September.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8203.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8203.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8203.webp"  /></p><p>This is about half of all the bottles I collected over the course of the two months.  The Choose-your-own Six pack worked fantastically for collecting as many varieties as possible in the short time frame.  Overall, I found 25 different Oktoberfests.</p><p>This was a slightly dangerous idea though, as it combined 2 of my addictions together: Drinking Beer and Collecting Things.</p><div class='title'><b>Remove Labels</b></div><p>To remove the labels, I used a Wine Label Remover Kit found on Amazon, though, it's a little more expensive than what it is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3" title="http://www.amazon.com/Wine-Label-Remover-Kit-REMOVERS/dp/B000UVJP6O/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1320069294&amp;sr=8-3">Link</a></p><p>Each wine label remover is basically a thin sheet of laminate.  You wrap the laminate around the bottle, completely covering the label.  Then you peel the laminate off the bottle, taking the label with it.Â   And cut off all the extra laminate around the label.</p><p>The labels can be subborn sometimes, so I used a box cutter to help it along in most cases.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8205.webp"  /></p><p>While it's just as easy (sometimes) to remove the label without the lamanent, i think the labels look much better with the lamanent.</p><div class='title'><b>Attach to Magnets</b></div><p>The last part is affixing them to magnets.  Easy enough.  My little brother recommended using magnets sheets, and Super 77 adhesive spray.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8473.webp"  /></p><p>And it worked quite well.  I sprayed the whole sheet with a layer of glue, and arranged as many labels as I could.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8472.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8472.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8472.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8496.webp"  /></p><p>Then cut the labels out.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8474.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8474.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8474.webp"  /></p><p>and Hurrah.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111030_beer/IMG_8561.webp"  /></p><p>These aren't arranged in any particular order.  Also, the Dogtoberfest labels are very stubborn to remove, so that one isn't pictured here.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 31, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 26, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Phantogram @ High Noon, Madison</h3><p>Phantogram is an American indie band with members Josh Carter and Sarah Barthel.  According to wikipedia, they formed in 2007, but I don't think anyone really heard of them until 2009.  And 2010 is really when they got their "big break", so to speak.</p><div class='title'><b>Eyelid Movies Tour</b></div><p>I was introduced to them last year, right as they started their first national tour for the release of their upcoming debut album, <b>Eyelid Movies</b>.  I saw them on the upcoming board for High Noon Saloon, and my brother, Bill, had mentioned that they were pretty good, and that I'd probably like them.  I listened to some of their songs, and definitely liked them indeed.</p><p>On my birthday last year was when they came into Madison, and my local record store, Strictly Discs, had them put on an intimate in-store performance limited to 50 people.  I got down there the moment they opened up, and made sure to secure my place in line.  Well, it turned out that not a lot of people had heard of this.  Or they weren't interested.  I came back around 3pm when they were actually performing, and was 1 out about 30 people who listened to their short 30 minute set.</p><p>It was pretty fantastic.  They have a very melodic tone that builds a very ambient atmosphere, followed with a drum beat that guides the melodic and chorus of songs.  It's relaxing, but still energetic.  It paints a picture in my mind, every time I hear their songs.</p><p>I recorded the whole performance, last year: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4" title="http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4">http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=DF2AF2B5B6F7CEC4</a></p><p>After they finished, everyone met upstairs for a quick meet-and-greet.  They brought along Vinyl copies of their yet unreleased album.  So I bought one of those, and got it signed by Josh and Sarah.  Unfortunately, I missed their performance at The High Noon later on due to birthday drinking.</p><p>Birthday Drinking wasn't a problem this year, because they came into town one day after.Â  And the concert was on a Monday night, so I wasn't about to get shit-faced on a work night.</p><div class='title'><b>Nightlife Tour</b></div><p>It had been a while since I heard anything about Phantogram.  I saw them on High Noon's upcoming list, and had wondered if they were going to perform anything new since last year.  All of the concerts I had heard leading up to last year, were the same 11 tracks from their album.</p><p>Once again, my brother Bill sent me a link for an upcoming mini-album titled <b>Nightlife</b>.  It had 6 songs, but it still gave me the same feelings I had when I first heard them.  Some songs were rather similar to their earlier stuff.  But others actually iterated on their style, went in a few different directions, but kept their sound in tact.  I really like <b>Turning into Stone</b>, which seems to channel Moby but keeps it in their own voice.</p><p>Last night, they performed at The High Noon Saloon to a sold out crowd.  Sold out! on a Monday night, even.  Phantogram's popularity is exploding right now.  Many critics have very high praise for <b>Nightlife</b>, and even publications such as Wired are even commenting on them.  It's kind of crazy.  I doubt it would be possible to do an intimate in-store performance with them as the place would be overrun.</p><p>Along with greater popularity and a greater crowd, their stage performance has expanded.  They hired a drummer, rather than using a drum looping kit, or whatever.  Using a live drummer really makes their sound POP even more than before.  <b>They are much better live now.</b> Before it just sounded the same.</p><p>They brought along a bunch of lazers and lights too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8387.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8390.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8392.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8420.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111024_phantogram/IMG_8449.webp"  /></p><p>The crowd at the High Noon was interesting.  There were plenty of girls, hipsters, and kids totally into the indie scene.  They probably follow pitchfork, who have been talking this band up.  Right in the front were a bunch of bros whom I wouldn't think would attend such a show.  In fact, they were the most into Phantogram out of the whole audience.  They were probably drunk, but their hands were in the air the whole time, and they were rockin' out.  They bought me beer, too. :)</p><p>I recorded some video, but I mostly took a bunch of pictures.

From the youtube clips I've seen of the show, it looked pretty neat.</p><p>Here is the trailer for his tour: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWai4UZ0OqI</a></p><p>While the trailer represents what you see on the stage, it has a bunch of audience reactions, which leads me to believe their intended audience is the older, married, family crowd.  These are the types of trailers you'd see for the Blue Man Group, or magicians, or some stupid movie.  The type of trailer that's designed to get those boring people out of their houses and day-to-day lives, and experience something different for a change.</p><p>I'm not sure if they aired that trailer on TV, but the crowd in the Congress Theater was a bit different than the usual EDM crowd I'd expect in Chicago.  Sure, there were plenty of kids who most likely listen to dubstep and electro on the weekends.  As well as the crowd you'd find in clubs on the weekends.  But, there were also those couples who might have seen a commercial, such as the trailer, and figured they could use a night out for a change.  While the normal crowd was pushing and shoving their way around, the married crowd were respectful and nice about how packed the place was.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8259_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Opening for Amon Tobin was <b>Emika</b>, who was the official tour opener.  I really don't remember much of her set at all.  We got there about 10 minutes before she finished.  But before Amon Tobin took the stage, they sandwiched in a local opener, <b>Lorn</b>.  Lorn is one half of local electronica group <b>Omega Clash</b>, whose other half is <b>adoptahighway</b>.  I've seen adoptahighway before, and he's pretty slick.  Lorn wasn't too bad either.  He performed a somewhat downtempo, slightly experimental, yet banging set.  It was perfect for keeping the mood solid, while keeping the energy low in anticipation for Amon.</p><p>Lorn finished close to 11pm, and it took a little while for Amon to get everything setup.  I think he finally started around 11:30pm.  The curtains pulled up, and revealed the gigantic geometry stage thingy.  For the most part, it served as a canvas for the visualizations being blasted onto it from the projector right behind Five and I.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8286.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8307.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8317.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8319.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8322.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8334.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8339.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8342.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8344.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8345.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8357.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8376.webp"  /></p><p>The stage presence was huge, and reflected and reacted to the music. Amon Tobin's set was basically playing his new album ISAM from start to finish, with a little improvisation between tracks, but it didn't seem like much.  I hadn't listened to the album ahead of time, but I dunno...  It didn't really speak to me at all.  It was experimental in nature, and didn't really have any groove to it.  Without a constant beat to frame the sounds, it didn't capture my interest.</p><p>After Amon finished ISAM, he exited his contraption, got up a stage, and took a bow.  And went back inside for an encore.  After his encore, he did the same thing, and came back for a second encore.  The style of his first encore was much more drum 'n bass than experimental, and his second encore was kinda in the middle of his two styles.  I'm guessing that his started off as drum 'n bass, and eventually moved into experimental later.</p><div class='title'><b>ISAM v. Shpongletron</b></div><p>Earlier in year, Fishy, Chaos and I saw Shpongle as he rolled in Madison on tour with his own crazy stage contraption known as the Shpongletron.  It has wings on the side, and an eye on the top that were made out of LEDs and had several visualizations programmed into them.  In the center sat the Shpongle head.  It would illuminate itself, and the colors would change.  The light source on the head would change as well, which was somewhat trippy to think of how it was doing that.  But then it moved!  The head twisted and contorted.  It would stick its tongue out at you.  It was really interesting to see, mainly because I wasn't expecting that at all.  And there wasn't a projector around either, so I really wasn't sure how that was happening.</p><p>Here's video I took from that show: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWg&amp;t=17m55s">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBm7osMGLWf</a> at the 18 minute mark.</p><p>With Amon Tobin's ISAM stage setup, that suspension of disbelief was never there.  The huge projectors in the middle of the floor shone like a spotlight on the stage, and you could clearly see the geometry of the stage setup for what it was.  Plus, there were few times when the visualizations actually took advantage of the cubed nature of the structure.  And even then, you could clearly tell it was being painted on by the projector.</p><p>It really wasn't until Amon's second encore when the visualization reached the level I had experienced with the Shpongletron.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111021_amon/IMG_8373.webp"  /></p><p>It painted a bunch of stacked cubes on the structure, and they twisted, and collapsed several times.  It was subtle and fit with the design, so it looked believable (at least until they fell over).  The whole rest of the show was way too deliberate.  Some of it would have been better off using a giant LED display instead.</p><p>Overall, it was alright.  Amon Tobin is part of the Ninja Tune record label.  And while I'm a big fan of that label, I think I need to remind myself that their music is very hit-or-miss with me.  Some experimental really grooves and speaks to me, but I think I need to be in a certain mood to receive it properly.  Otherwise, it falls flat :/</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 26, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 14, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">DJ Promos</h3><p>I've been a fan of the music for over a decade.  And I continue to listen to the music, both new and old, almost all day long.  I'm always finding some new tracks, or great new artists I hadn't heard of before.  The Internet continues to bring the world of music together, and people can easily display their works, get feedback, and evolve fast.</p><p>I go out to local clubs fairly regularly, and watch how the local talent evolves.  As well as make the trek to Minneapolis or Chicago to see some of the best DJs in the world evolve and shape the industry.</p><p>I have always had the fascination of DJing myself.  Back in the day, this was impossible for me.  At $10 a pop, records are not cheap.  Plus, I needed to buy all the equipment, and there was no guarantee I'd be any good at it.  Before DJs went digital, most local DJs either worked at, or spent all their free time in record stores.  They'd be exposed to all the new tracks, and have the equipment available to them on a daily basis.  I didn't have the knowledge, the skills, or the money to invest in doing any of that.</p><p>But in modern times all of that has changed.  All the record stores are online, and you can fit DAYS worth of music in your pocket.  Songs are a mere $1 or $2.  And the only equipment you need to start off with is a laptop with the correct software.  As time goes on, you'll probably pick up equipment to make it easier and more diverse.Â  The best local DJs end up spending all their time on the computer, whether it be on the Internet, or playing around with tracks.</p><p>With that in mind, my friends finally convinced me to give it a go.  I already had collected a bunch of my favorite tracks I've heard over the years, and a whole bunch of new ones.  I downloaded Traktor, and started mixing them together.</p><div class='title'><b>Summertime!</b></div><p>One of my friends throws his annual bonfire party towards the end of summer, and he let me in charge of the music.Â  Leading up to the party, I would collect a bunch of music during the day while listening at work.  When I got home, I'd download them, and mix them all together for the rest of the night.  Things sounded pretty decent.</p><p>I made a promo mix leading up to his party, so people would have an idea of the sound I was bringing.  Or after the party, people could have something to listen to.</p><p>So that's this mix...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/001.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MWkRCSWIyYi13TjA/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 001.mp3</a><br/><br/>It includes many favorites that I can't get enough of. :)</p><p>1.

Orbital - Halcyon + On + On is one of my favorite songs, and Aaron Static's bootleg is an amazing cut of it.</p><p>Overall the party was quite a success.  Gage lent me his mixing board and speakers, so things sounded excellent.  I mixed tracks together for about 8 hours from mid-afternoon into the night.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/110806_caleb/IMG_5937.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>End of Summertime!</b></div><p>After the party, I was busy with a bunch of other things and didn't really get back to mixing more tracks.  I had another DJ mix lined up to record after the party, and I've heard some amazing music since then.  I wanted to make another one before I got the Internet restored in my apartment, and start downloading a whole lot of new tracks.  I wanted to capture some of arrangements I found while mixing stuff together for 8 hours.</p><p>After listening to what I had, a lot of it didn't really fit in a one hour time slot.  There really wasn't a good starting point and ending point to include what I wanted.  So, I basically cut it in half, and built up the first chunk with the following mix.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/music/002.webp"  /></p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B09hIdYBQ74MaTQ2bVJWZTVFdVE/edit?usp=sharing">gdocs / Dyreschlock 002.mp3</a><br/><br/>1.

So it's possible I'll end up with something completely different than I intended, much like this last mix.</p><p>Good Times :)</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 14, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 5, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Ladytron @ Fine Line Music Cafe, Minneapolis</h3><p>I listen to a lot of music.  While almost all of this music falls into electronica, and mostly dance and DJ music from there, I try to branch out a bit and find artists that sound different than the rest, or ones that sound totally amazing to me.  This is probably how most DJs cultivate and shape their careers.  At least the ones that actually grow and continue to be relevant, while others drown in the minutia of popular tracks from others.</p><p>I find some pretty amazing music, but end up moving on to the next thing after a while.  As such, I lose track of the artist.  And tend to forget about them, and not really notice if they create anything new, or how their career changes and sound evolves over time.  I never really understand them anymore than a single or few tracks from a particular moment in time.</p><div class='title'><b>Ladytron</b></div><p>But there are a few musicians that I've kept track of over multiple years, and tend to shape my own opinion and taste in music.  One of these bands is <b>Ladytron</b>.  Ladytron has four members, Mira and Helen trade off singing vocals, while Daniel and Reuben are always on synths in the background.   I started listening to these guys towards the end of college in 2005 and 2006.</p><p>They've been around since 1999, and if I heard some of their tracks from the beginning, I probably would have shrugged them off and went on to something else.  In fact, who knows...  I probably did back in the day, and don't remember.  Most of their original songs were kinda emo and seemed to speak to teenage girls.  Their first two albums consisted of several songs dealing with boyfriends and modeling.</p><div class='title'><b>Witching Hour + Velocifero</b></div><p>Around the time I started listening to them, their sound had evolved.  Their third album, Witching Hour (2005), focused much more on the beat and progression of the songs, rather than the lyrics.  The lyrics served as flavor text to captivate the audience, while the beat hooks them in.  "High Rise", "Destroy Everything You Touch", "International Dateline", and "Fight in Built up areas" are all pretty bad ass.  I think <b>High Rise</b> might be my favorite song.</p><p>Velocifero (2008), their fourth album, continued with their more layered rocking atmosphere, but seemed to dial a little bit back, rather than push forward.  Ladytron went on tour in early 2009, which is when I saw them for the first time.</p><p><a href="/old/v6/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago" title="/ladytron-the-faint-metro-chicago">Ladytron @ Metro, Chicago // April 4th, 2009</a></p><p>After they finished up the tour, it seemed like they disappeared.  They didn't produce any new music.  They didn't go on tour.  They hardly did anything at all.  Apparently, there was rumor of them breaking up circulating last year.  I think Helen and Mira went off and worked on some new things of their own, while Daniel and Reuben worked on some new songs.</p><div class='title'><b>Gravity the Seducer</b></div><p>And then, early this year, it seemed like a flood of Ladytron news hit the Internet.  They had a brand new single, and an upcoming compilation album focusing on their first ten years, as well as a remix album.  In the middle of the year, they announced their fifth album, Gravity the Seducer, along with a tour promoting the CD!</p><p>While some of the songs on their new CD follow the same vein as Velocifero, Gravity the Seducer has several tracks that are much more ambient than anything they've done before.  It's somewhat odd because the two sounds don't really compliment each other.  <em>White Elephant</em>, <em>Ace of Hz</em>, and <em>Mirage</em> build up the album with their classic sound,  while <em>White Gold</em>, <em>Moon Palace</em>, <em>Altitude Blues</em> etc bring it to a different place.</p><p>I wonder if this inconsistency was born from their unofficial hiatus and rumored breakup.  Maybe Reuben and Daniel were working on this direction when Mira and Helen came back.</p><div class='title'><b>Tour in Minneapolis!</b></div><p>Anyway, last night!, their North American tour came through Minneapolis.  I rented a car, and met up with my little sister to see them live.  The Fine Line Music Cafe is a fantastic venue where I've seen some of my favorite concerts of all time, including Hybrid on <a href="/old/v6/hybrid" title="/hybrid">November 14th, 2003</a> and Moby on <a href="/old/v6/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis" title="/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">October 5th, 2009</a>.</p><p>The place slowly filled up with fans, and the crowd was rather diverse and odd.  You had your typical hipster-like youth, and the slightly older alternative crowd.  There were also a couple of punkers there.  And the typical concert going music lovers, like myself.  In addition, there were several older patrons who I would not expect to find at the place.  One of these guys even talked with me at length at how he's such a fan of Ladytron, and how no one he knows has even heard of them before.  I wonder if this is how it'll be for me in 15 years.</p><p>Musician Sonoio was on opening duties, and he warmed up the crowd with his eclectic music.  I'm not really sure how to describe his music.  It was definitely experimental, but felt like it had a tinge of Japanoise thrown on top.  Not like over the top Japanoise, but a more mellow ambient rendition.  I dunno...

The levels never matched the album versions of their songs.  The drums were either too loud, or not enough.  Some of the synths weren't harmonizing together.  It was a muted experience.  And that was reflected when I saw them in 2009.  It was the exact same sound as their live stuff.</p><p>But that wasn't the case this time.  Not only were all the levels at the perfect balance, and everything harmonized together, it was amplified ten fold and actually engulfed the audience in the atmosphere present from their fantastic songs of Witching Hour.  Also, I was right up from next to the speaker, so that helped too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_7989.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8019.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8076.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8057.webp"  /></p><p>With the exception of Gravity the Seducer, I've listening to their other songs over and over again, so there weren't many surprises that came out of the night.  The whole audience kept in a constant groove as Ladytron went down their set list.  I kind of wish I hadn't seen that ahead of time.  &lt;_&lt;</p><p>Things did change when they hit "Fighting in Built up Areas."  That song really popped, and threw down a dancey beat.  Everyone was hopping around.  My little sister wasn't too impressed with the evening until they hit this beat.</p><p>Overall, I thought the concert was pretty fantastic.  These songs have never sounded as great as they did in The Fine Line.  Listening to their album version doesn't do the night justice.  I recorded a couple moments from the night, but I think "Fighting in Built up Areas", "High Rise", and "Little Black Angel" were the highlights for me.</p><p>Also!  My little sister and I got a poster of "White Elephants" signed by Mira, Helen, Reuben and Daniel.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111003_ladytron/IMG_8108.webp"  /></p><p>Score!</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 5, 2011<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">October 2011</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/ladytron-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">5</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/dj-promos">14</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/phantogram-high-noon-madison">26</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/batman-arkham-city-thoughts">31</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
