This was his second stop on his two or three week tour around the US, which came just one day after his new novel, Snuff, was released to the public.  I've been to a few book signings before, but this one was a completely different experience despite, fundamentally, being the same thing.</p><p>The Triple Rock's venue is clearly a music venue.  The elevated stage overlooks a sizable dancing pit-like area with a lounge area surrounding it and there's a bar in the back to pick up drinks.  Unlike the book signings I've been to before, it was standing room only, minus a couple of tables of chairs here and there.  The place was setup as if some band was about the crash the stage and everyone would rock along and, quite honestly, that's pretty much what happened.</p><p>After Chuck signed a bunch of books at the front, the moderator of the venue got up on stage and introduced him.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0961.webp" /></p><p>He greeted the crowd and laid out the events for the rest of the evening.  Chuck introduced Don Pollack to the stage and Don began to read from his book, Knockemstiff.  The vibe of the audience was quite the same of any book reading.  Everyone was quite polite and gave Don their ears.  However, the tone and content of the book sent the audience into a joyous hysteria.  The book was pretty funny, and no one held back any laughter.</p><p>Afterwards, Chuck took the stage again and began to read a short story he'd written, Loser, which he has no plans to publish.  The atmosphere erupted again with laughter, hanging off of each word Chuck spoke.  The excitement and joy of the crowd really elevated the story and brought it to life.</p><p>That atmospheric involvement worked incredibly well with Chuck's writing style.  Chuck's writing is always in first person and illustrates the characters thoughts and emotions thoroughly and comically.  I really feel like I'm inside the character's head and can understand his motives and reasons for doing what they do.  And experiencing it within the same bubble as everyone else, and being on the same page is a very collective feeling.</p><p>The variety of poeple that came to this event was far from homogeneous, yet through the brunt dark reality of Loser we're all connected.  I think it takes a certain personality to really thoroughly enjoy Chuck's writing, a dark honest side we can relate to but never live..  and it's interesting seeing all the people that probably feel the same way and how they look just like anyone you'd ever meet.</p><div class='title'><b>Aside from the readings...</b></div><p>Anyways, aside from the readings, Chuck interspersed a few games between the night's events.  The game, which we played twice, we see how fast you could inflate blow-up dolls that he through into the audience.  Winner's of the game would receive a copy of Don's book, Knockemstiff.  I have some pretty decent lungs, but the people in the front row were just a little bit quicker.</p><p>After the games, Chuck held a Q&A session, where most of the questions came from the moderator :rolls eyes:.  Thankfully, the questions weren't really all that bad.  For each little question she asked, Chuck really owned the answer and brought it back to something that was probably rehearsed.</p><p>He said that he really isn't that big a talker, but he loves to listen to people.  He listens on how they talk about others.. and how they're really talking about themselves.  When you're talking about another person, you're really describing yourself through them.  You elevate and highlight what emotions you feel when you think of them, whether it's good or bad, and paint a separate picture of them that's distinct from who they actually are.</p><p>I found this interesting because that's exactly how his recent novels are written, contrary to his early novels which were the opposite.  All of his first novels centered on a single character and you read from their point of view the entire book.  Everything was first-person and about you.  Actually, Diary was the first one that really changed this pattern where he tried to write in third-person, but from the first-person perspective of some one else.</p><p>In my opinion, Rant was his first success in writing this way.  Rant had the first-person perspective of many people focusing on the third-person view of a single character.  Snuff is laid out the same way, but I haven't read it yet to fully comment on it.</p><div class='title'><b>Free Stuff</b></div><p>He also spoke about using props within the context of the book to keep the characters centered, and always bring the reader back to a point or theme.  Themes are pretty good for describing and flushing out characters, but I think using props to enforce those themes is a little too obvious.  Like having flowers for a symbol of love..</p><p>Chuck said that Snuff has several props throughout the book, two of which were a blow-up doll and an autograph hound.  He had already thrown a bunch of blow-up dolls into the audience for the games, but he had several garbage bags full of autograph hounds he gave to the crowd as another thank you for coming. ^_^</p><p>Luckily, I'm tall, so catching all this stuff above the crowd is pretty easy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080521_snuff/IMG_0982.webp" /></p><p>Also, every participant of the reading got a pre-signed copy of the Snuff novel with a Choke bookmark.  The bookmark has a rather symbolic prop from Choke attached to it.</p><div class='title'><b>Choke</b></div><p>Speaking of Choke, we were also treated to the Trailer for the Choke movie which comes out in theaters this coming September.  Choke is Chuck's third novel, and the movie has been "in the works" for the past 8 years.  The initial movie rights were sold a year after Fight Club came out in theaters.</p><p>The Trailer is online today, and you can find it <a href="http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=235956" title="http://www.mtv.com/overdrive/?vid=235956">HERE</a>, at MTV's website.  It'd probably be the first movie I've ever seen where I've actually read the book FAR in advance of the movie's release.  I should probably read it again before September.<br/>____</p><p>Anywho, I had a great time ^_^ and hopefully next time I'll hear about tickets far in advance, so I can get some more of my books signed by him.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 27, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 24, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Relax</h3><p>The soft touch of light slowly warming my hair, a cool breeze tickling the hairs on my arm, and the distant laughter of children playing and screaming.  Their endless amount of energy sending them up and down all over the playground I noticed earlier.  A dog's joyous bark echoes through the trees and over the grass.  Cheerful chirping from the green above eases the tense nature of the week.  I sink slowly, further and further into the soft shards of grass underneath that thin layer of cotton of my white shirt.  The sun fills it with warmth and the shirt embraces me to return the favor.</p><p>Every day, in and out, I come across a problem and I attempt to solve it in the best way I can.  I obsess over the nature of the error and try to understand the fundamental cause.  Examine each little piece of data and search bit-by-bit for commonality, relevance, and origin.  I study and study and eventually find what I'm looking for.  A tiny hint of wrong, a small burst of error, a shred of relevance to the true nature of the crime.  It's the little piece of the puzzle that blows the case wide open and with the error in sight the extermination begins.</p><p>A puff of liquid erupts into the air.  This poisonous noxious chemical stings my nose at the very sound of it.  Tiny little droplets of this crap disperse and coat the back of this freckled little brat.  The skin twitches with the slight temperature change, but he still continues ruining my day.  His obnoxious screams tear through the warmth and breeze.  The chirping ceases and vacates the area.  The little fucker burst my bubble.</p><p>Usually when you find the root of the problem, the solution is easy.  Syntaxual errors are typical.  Usage errors are also common, but aren't as easy to fix.  Fundamental errors, though, are the most devastating with anything.  Faulty assumptions and brittle architecture will bring down anything.  The foundation must be sound and flexible and must be left open.  Hide nothing and expose everything so fault can be easily found.</p><p>The truth hurts like a constant ringing of the ears.  A stain on the scene of the portrait I've painted for myself.  A perfect little world can fall apart so easily with just one fundamental problem.  Of course, we always learn from our mistakes and we take that knowledge as part of the solution.  To build a better tomorrow away from the mistakes we've made.  To start again and rebuild to perfection.</p><p>Wrong.  You fix mistakes.  You don't start over.  You mend the little world you have regardless of the distress you must endure.  Large mistakes or small, they're still mistakes that exist and must be fixed.  Understanding the mistake will always lead to the solution, but the path is not always obvious.</p><p>That stupid kid keeps crying his head off while the mom puts her around him and consoles him.  It doesn't quite quell the noise, but he seems like he's on the road to recovery.  It doesn't really matter, though.  Their presence is a wall blocking that area of my little sunny world.  Every motion, every breath.. I can hear everything they do, what they're touching, what they're thinking.  They've infected my senses and ruined everything.  ugh.. I'm outta here.</p><p>The problem was that some part of the program was doing something it wasn't supposed to.  This particular class assumed that whoever used it, did so in a specific order.  The class didn't really give any clues about the correct order.  Apparently whoever uses this class is supposed to look into the class and study it completely first.  Ya know, really get to know who you're dealing with.  Only when you knew everything there it to know about the class, could you use it with the at-most efficiency.  Fixing the error is easy, but that doesn't solve the problem.  This class needs a little redirection on what it means to be "user-friendly".</p><p>Out of one world and into another.  The park was pretty nice, but overall a waste of time.  There are a thousand other things I could be doing rather than laying in the sun.  Stuff is backing up at work, I could probably do some of that.  I have two discs from Netflix I haven't watched either, I could probably do those both at once.  I just hooked up my PS2, though, so I could start playing some of those games.  So many things to do.</p><p>A little bit of refactoring brings the class back into society a new and better person.  The error is fixed and shouldn't return in the future.  A perfect little cog in the machine...<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 24, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 11, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Grand Theft Auto IV</h3><p>I decided to pick up Grand Theft Auto IV today.  One of my local Shopkos had a couple Special Editions left and after thinking about how well its being received, huge future add-ons rumored, and a large chunk of my friend's list playing it...  I thought it'd be a good idea to go with the flow.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0949.webp" /></p><p>Though, upon picking it up this afternoon, I noticed that all other copies of GTA IV were sold out.  Sooo.. I guess it wasn't just a shot in the dark that Shopko had some special editions left.  They weren't purchased because it's ridiculously expensive.  The Special Edition is $30 more expensive than the already expensive price of next-gen games.</p><div class='title'><b>Special Edition Swag</b></div><p>Here's what $30 buys you:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080511_gta/IMG_0952.webp" /></p><p>There's the lock-box with two keys, a Rockstar keychain, an artbook for GTAIV, an OST sampler, a Rockstar dufflebag, and the game.  The lock-box is pretty cool and it's somewhat sturdy, but if it were locked, I could easily rip the thing open.  It's not that sturdy, unfortunately.  The artbook doesn't provide a whole lot of insight.  The dufflebag is kinda cheap, but it's not bad.  It'll work great as a travel laundry bag or a gym bag.  Also, the keychain is pretty slick.</p><p>The special edition may be expensive but comes with a bunch of things.  If that CD isn't too bad, with the keychain and dufflebag, I'd say the $30 isn't that wasteful.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>I've only played about 3 or 4 hours so far, but I needed to take a break.  The controls make me feel like it's work to do anything in the game.  I don't want to drive anywhere because I feel like I'm driving through sand the entire time, which hinders everything I do in the game.  I can't chase people because they get away too fast and can't evade cops fast enough.  I feel like I'm dragging my feet the entire time.</p><p>That's the only thing problem I have with the game, thus far.  Unfortunately, it keeps me from having tons of fun, but I'm still having fun.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 11, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 10, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Speed Racer is Amazing</h3><p>I went down to Freeport this weekend to see Speed Racer with Erika and Stephen and was blown away.  I think the Wachowski brother nailed the intensity of racing with the fast paced cuts and transitions of Anime and lit everything together with THE most brilliant and vibrant colors I've ever seen it a movie.</p><p>I think it's one of the few movies to actually bring live action elements into the cartoon world, rather bringing its characters into the real world.  I reminds me a lot of Dick Tracy and The Flintstones, rather than Batman or Spiderman.  The characters and their environment are completely in sync, rather than some goofy cartoon logic in our own world.</p><p>Critics seem to be pissed about this though saying the movie is sensory overload disconnected from reality.  That's exactly what it is.  What did you think it was going to be?  How is that fact a downfall?  Critics are killing this movie in the same way they did with Matrix Reloaded.  They expect one thing... and get something else.</p><p>Honestly, I think when the Wachowskis ground themselves in reality, the results are horrible.. like V for Vendetta.</p><p>Unfortunately, the critics get their way since Speed Racer flopped taking in only $20.2 million this weekend, a percentage compared to Iron Man's opening $100 million weekend and another $50 million this weekend.</p><p>I loved every minute of this minute and can't wait to see it again.  Next time, it'll be at the Imax.  If you hate the movie because its crazy, then you're too old.</p><p>Also, I'm disapointed in Mathew Fox.

It's not completely smashed and the wheels are still in perfect shape, but the tank itself is slightly dented like you were squeezing a pop can.  It's been destroyed with such gentle force compared to the other one.  Like an elephant or a giant brushed up beside it.</p><p>Anyways, this whole scene would've been more surreal if this security guard wasn't watching me the whole time as I crossed over the police "Do Not Cross This Line" yellow banner and walked around for 10 minutes.  And then all these police sirens went off and I took off running.  I like that last photo, but I probably could've taken some better ones.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 4, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 4, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Musical Weekend</h3><p>Musical Weekend</p><p>This weekend, I happened to do a lot of music related activities.</p><div class='title'><b>Jonathan Coulton @ Majestic</b></div><p>On Friday, Jonathan Coulton was in town and brought his pals Paul and Storm.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0864.webp" /></p><p>Paul and Storm were a decent opening act, but a lot of their humor feel short with me.  I thought the bulk out their comedy was a little too obvious and wasn't really as clever as Coulton's songwriting.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080501_coulton/IMG_0865.webp" /></p><p>Coulton was absolutely hilarious though. ^_^  My favorite part of the night was totally his live rendition of Mr. Fancy Pants with his Midi Controller in which he rick roll'd several times.  I tried to find a YouTube of him doing it, but it appears he does that song differently each time.</p><p>Coulton was great, but the best part of the night was running into plenty of friends whom I thought would show up and some I didn't expect ^_^.  I went with Tony and Erika, and met up with Dan & Becky.  Stacie was there too; I hadn't seen her in a while.  One of my co-workers, Chris, got in at the last minute.  And Kyle Heins, too!  If this was slightly coordinated better, we could've hung out for a while, but oh well.  Tony, Erika, Dan & Becky and I went to a bar downtown for a while before heading home for the evening and that worked out great ^_^</p><p>Also, I probably could've taken better pictures, but I decided to hang out and listen to the music and my top priority of the evening instead.  Plus, the whole place was decked out with chairs.. how the hell are you supposed to get into the music when you're sitting on your ass!?  Oh well, these songs weren't really the dancing or rocking out variety.</p><div class='title'><b>Eccentric Beats 5 Year Anniversary</b></div><p>The next day, I took a greyhound up to Minneapolis to catch Eccentric Beats 5 year anniversary in 1st Ave's VIP room.

Leon J tore the tracks up and down and all over the place.  His energy kept the beat very strong and very hard minute after minute after minute.

As his music filled the entire room, more and more people began to show up and the people began to fill in all the space the music occupied.

He started with some smooth sounds and it felt pretty standard the whole night.  Maybe I don't have the ear I thought I did for his music, but Leon J stole the show, in my opinion.  Phil K's could not reach the energy level Leon already hit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0889.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0899.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080502_philk/IMG_0916.webp" /></p><p>Overall, it was a fantastic night ^_^.  It was the first time I had ever been to 1st Ave, despite it being the oldest running venue in Minneapolis.  It was also the first time I got to bring my little sister along, so that was fun too.
