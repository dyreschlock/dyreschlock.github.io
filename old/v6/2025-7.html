Since childhood (but really since college), I wanted to build a library of games. I wanted to have shelves of all the best games for each of my favorite platforms and prominently face my favorites. I even had dreams of opening my own game store at one point.</p><p>A lot of folks of my generation had the same feelings and you can see images of their libraries show up on all kinds of social media. However, these days, building such a collection seems totally unnecessary. One of my original goals for building a collection was access. </p><p>I wanted to always be able to play these games in the future. But games preservation is incredible these days. All consoles from the mid 90s and before can be replicated with near perfect accuracy using FPGA software. For consoles of the Playstation 2 era, mods exist to give you immediate access to hundreds of games from the greats to the goofy. I don't need the originals anymore.</p><p>Additionally, I moved overseas over 12 years ago now. Even though I own the original games, I don't have access to them as they're back in the US, half a world away. Also, even if I was able to bring all those games here, I don't have room for them. All of my stuff has been burning space away in my mother's basement, and each time I go home, I am reminded of it (not be her).</p><p>So, with far greater access to these games through FPGA and modded consoles, I decided to go deep on getting rid of them. It was time to make some heavy cuts. And ultimately I would sell HALF of my physical collection. I sold a total of <b>264 games</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Deep Cuts</b></div><p>The main cuts of my collection came from Playstation and Sega Saturn.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_3282_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I bought so many Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games while I was in college and the years after. I often went on raids to rural department stores and used stores. I would mark all these places on maps and hit every single one on weekends driving out of town. </p><p>Then I did the same when I studied abroad in Japan and the subsequent trips after. In 2006, I was coming back from Book Off and Geo with bags full of Saturn games and accessories, and other unique Playstation games that never came to the US.</p><p>I had a pretty amazing collection, but it all sat dormant in my Mom's basement. If I wanted to play any of these games, I already had access to them in my home in Japan. Holding on to all these games really served no purpose other than nostalgia. And I had so many games that I bought and never played that my nostalgia wasn't really all that strong for the majority of them. (That being said, there were several games I did not sell because of nostalgia.)</p><div class='title'><b>Quick Save Games</b></div><p>While I always try to sell things on eBay, it's fucking terrible now. eBays takes about 40% of the money you make for all sales. Plus, if you sell more than $600, you need to claim it as income unless you prove you aren't making a profit by submitting receipts. The alternative is Facebook Marketplace, but I have never used it before and had no luck with my meager postings.</p><p>One of my friends mentioned a used games store in Madison WI that had knowledgable staff and offered fair current prices for games. I had always balked at the idea of selling to a store because you will never get a fair price. They are buying your inventory to sell and they must make a profit. But, my friend vouched for them. This was <b>Quick Save Games</b>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4399_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I made a detailed list of the games I wanted to get rid of, and I sent them an email asking what they thought. They replied and after going through each individual game, they sent me a quote. Ultimately, this was far easier and faster than creating individual entries on eBay. Plus, I didn't have to mess with shipping and all that. Obviously, I wasn't getting 100% of the current price, but I was never going to get that through eBay.</p><p>After the first quote, I created a second list with further cuts into my collection, and (as mentioned above) my eventual total was <b>264 games</b>. Also, I was able to get rid of all my extra Amiibos, game soundtracks, and artbooks.</p><div class='title'><b>Road Trip</b></div><p>I collected all of my games into six bins, packed the bins into my Mom's car, and drove the 5 hours from Minneapolis down to Madison. They opened at Noon, so I stopped at a few places along the way.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4149_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I thought it would be a pretty quick drop off and I'd have time to go to the bank, but it took them 5 hours to verify and price everything. That's not really a slight, though. They had to go through around 350 pieces of merchandise nonstop over 5 hours on their work day, all with me waiting on him so I could go back to Minneapolis. Even with prep work from the list I gave, they still had to do inventory, verification, and I also added some more stuff that I shoved in there at the last minute.</p><p>It was a signficant amount of work, and they went through things far more meticulously than any part-time folk at a lesser reselling store. I'm not sure what site they were using for prices (I think it could've been PriceCharting?), but it was very thorough and I was able to get an excellent return on all my games immediately.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/IMG_4770_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Quick Save Games is a pretty amazing store. They have a signficant amount variety from all eras of gaming. They had Atari games, Genesis games, Nintendo, Playstation, Sega CD, Saturn, Xbox 360, and several Japanese games, too. They had some esoteric US releases, but nothing crazy esoteric, like a PC FX or an arcade board. It reminded me a lot of the stores I would visit 20 years ago. :)</p><p>One thing they really complained about was their space. I was really surprised at how little space they had. Some of my items were refused because they "didn't have space," but that was not just an excuse to refuse buying my Kickstarter copy of Wasteland on PC. Where would they put it here?</p><p>Also, despite being on the edge of town in Fitchburg, they got a lot of traffic. I haven't lived in Madison for over a decade, but there's not really much down there, right? I dunno. I must be wrong because they had a bunch of folks come through while I was there.</p><p>If you're down in Madison, I would absolutely recommend taking a look. It only opened in the last 2 years, and it seems like they often get new inventory.</p><div class='title'><b>Collection Halved</b></div><p>So, I went from <b>503</b> physical games down to <b>277</b>. That math doesn't work out. Even though I sold 264 games, there were many games that were in my collection, but not on my <a href="/apps/games" title="/apps/games">Video Game Collection</a> page. Also, I bought a couple more games since then.</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><div class="column"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_early2025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_early2025.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_early2025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_early2025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_early2025_t.webp" /></a></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_late2025.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_late2025.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_late2025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_late2025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250723_selling/games_collection_late2025_t.webp" /></a></div></div><br class="clr" /></p><p>There were some games that I could not part with just yet. Some of these were from a nostalgia point of view, like all of my <b>Dance Dance Revolution</b> games on Playstation. I don't have a complete collection, but I have all the best ones and my favorites, even though I also have them all on my modded PS2. I couldn't get rid of any <b>Zelda</b> games or mainline <b>Final Fantasy</b> games, either.</p><p>Also, I kept my most expensive games, too. <b>Panzer Dragoon Saga</b> for the American Saturn remains as my most expensive game. I also have <b>The Misadventures of Tron Bonne</b> complete with the Megaman 2 demo disk, all in excellent condition. And, I have my childhood <b>Zelda Ocarina of Time</b> gold cart. Plus all of the Zelda releases for Gamecube, many of which are sealed. My collection still has quite a bit of value. :)</p><p>While it does hurt to get rid of so much of what I built for myself, it felt really good to take a chunk out of my mountain of stuff that had been weighing me down for so long. And I still have so many books, magazines, movies, CD, action figures, and other crap. The schlock store shall open again whenever I get back to the states. I will really feel good when I get rid of the magazines and actions figures.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 31, 2025<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 31, 2025</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Wisconsin Veterans Museum</h3><p>Next to the state capitol in Madison, Wisconsin is a museum devoted to Wisconsin citizens were who veterans of American wars.

I visited State St and the Square and was shocked at how much the place had fallen apart, due to a combination of Covid and people working from home. Stores were boarded up and gone. They were in the process of tearing down some buildings. And homeless folks were everywhere.</p><p>There were always homeless people in Madison, but they were among the many other people walking around, working, and living in the area. Now, it felt empty and ravaged. I don't think the downtown area of Madison was the only place in America that has fallen apart in recent years. (Visiting the city during a rainstorm probably also contributed to the gloomy atmosphere.)</p><p>Anyways, one of my destinations in Madison was to visit where I used to work, Widen Enterprises. After graduating university, I worked for Widen Enterprises as a Software Developer for over 7 years and then worked abroad for them a litlte bit after coming to Japan.</p><p>Widen Enterprises had a history of print which began in the 40s. They first began detailing and manufacturing plates for newsprint and then broke into catalog printing in the 60s. In the 90s, they invested in developing a user interface and backend that would aid their customers and building these catalogs. This move was perfect syngery with their printing service.</p><p>However, with the Internet becoming more and more ubiquitous, print died and their software division grew considerably. During my years of working there, the printing division became smaller and smaller. The basement used to have huge printers for all their costumer's catalogs. As company's workflows moved online, less and less were printing and these printers just took up space. Just after I left, I think the entire print division was disbanded.</p><p>Widen's Digital Asset Management system grew to become their main focus and now it had become their only focus. When I began work there, we occupied half of the top floor. After I left, the building was remodeled and development took over the entire ground floor.</p><p>Even before the Covid years, I think many developers and staff worked from home at least one day a week. And then during Covid, I think everyone switched to remote working. Not uncommon for companies in the US.</p><p>According to Wikipedia, in September 2021, they sold the company to Acquia. Acquia's main product is a line of content management software for your enterprise website. Having a digital asset management system is powerful tool to allow your costumers to host all their product images and use their software to build their corporate website or commerical website around it.</p><p>Over the 4 years of ownership and looking at some staff listsing at Acquia, it looks like much of the brilliant excellent folks at Widen have been moved into more senior roles within Acquia.

It is no longer used by any developers or staff still working on DAM, wherever they may be. I think Widen had been at this location since the late 60s or 70s? Some of the other print buildings in the area still look like they're in business. It seems like a blight to have one of the major businesses in the area gone.</p><p>Someone had recently mowed the lawn, so it doesn't look too bad. But there are still some overgrown plants around the parking lot. Nobody comes here. (The overgrowth is much more present on Google Street View.) I'm not sure when they sold the building.

I learned about how the Japanese people threw themselves into nationalism and made the war more about an attack on their nation's pride rather than about human rights. And I learned about how they suffered as a result. I've seen and learned a lot from the Japanese point of view having visited war sites and museums in Nagasaki, Hiroshima, and Okinawa. </p><p>I've never been to any war sites in America. Honestly, we really don't have many at all because we never had any part of our homeland touched by war. Our military bases are still in use, and if they are decommissioned, they are demolished. Our experience in war has almost always been foreign.</p><p>When I was back in the states over summer, I wanted to visit a location I had heard about while living in Madison. The Badger Munitions Factory was a plant near Baraboo to the north that developed and manufactured bullets for our soldiers in World War II.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4168_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The actual full title was The Badger Army Ammunition Plant, and they did not directly manufacture bullets. Scientists and workers in the plant devleloped and synthesized Nitric Acid and Sulfric Acid combined with other agents to create rocket propellant, smokeless powder used in rifle bullets and tank shells, and explosion powder used in hand grenades and tear gas canisters.</p><p>The plant itself only developed and shipped the powder. Other plants and factors in the midwest received the powder and used them in ammunition.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4165_t.webp" /></a></p><p>These days, there's not much to see. Full demolition of all buildings was completed in 2013. The security gate entrance was still standing, and seemed like the only remaining original building in the lot. Outside of the entrance, to the left, was a memorial stone showing the families that "gave up" their land for the plant to be built. To the right was a modern building that served as the museum to the plant and a headquarters for the Badger History Group.</p><p>The grounds inside the fence were open to explore, but there were many No Trespassing signs indicating that lands were owned by the Ho-Chunk Nation. Later, I noticed that not all of the lands were in possession of the Ho-Chunk, and it was okay to drive around most of the area.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4340_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I did drive around the area anyways and found a pair of storage shelters. Looking online through old photos, these appear to be a few more original buildings. These days, some local farmers were using them to store hay bails.</p><p>The museum was pretty fascinating. There were tons of photos taken during its operation, many relics from the buildings, and several displays showing the temperature of the times. While the plant's main use was for World War II, it was put into operation again from 1951 to 1957 for the Korean War, and from 1965 to 1975 for Vietnam. Protesters from UofM came up to the plant to protest in the late 60s.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4273_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The plant really only had those three major periods of operation. In 1977, the army put the plant on hiatus. In 1997, the plant was deemed unnecessary. A series of corporations exchanged control of the environmental cleanup and eventually demolition, which completed in 2013. The land was divided up mainly between the US Department of Agriculture, the Ho-Chunk Nation, and the National Park Service.</p><p>If I get a chance, it would be nice to return on a sunny day. I didn't explore too much because of the rain, and photos looked terrible. Although, I guess I'm not really sure what else I'll see. Search for cement foundations of buildings and take photos? It would be more interesting to take aerial photos.</p><p>The badger museum and the entrance gateway had maps that I didn't fully study at the time. I think <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSY9ZAxLWxwuj23HGyucOjYYmrqSwzvy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSY9ZAxLWxwuj23HGyucOjYYmrqSwzvy/view?usp=drive_link">this map was an early version</a>.

Also, there was so much much more to this area than I original thought. Those storage shelters were still only near the entrance. I didn't travel anywhere near any of the other points of interest listed here. I am too used to living in Japan where everything is so dense, so I did not imagine this area to be miles!</p><p>I think I will try to return next time I'm back in the states.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_01_ammunitions/IMG_4214_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The museum was an excellent resource of the history of the plant and it was completely free. They sold some books and asked for donations, but it was not required. An old man was stationed there and talked a lot about the working conditions in the plant and safety. (I wasn't really paying attention, though, sorry.)</p><p>I grabbed some flyers on my way out, and scanned them when I got back home.</p><p>Badger Army Ammunition Museum flyer: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOr7c7QuLElsN15224dVh3CfREuRr1Ki/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jOr7c7QuLElsN15224dVh3CfREuRr1Ki/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_museum_flyer.pdf</a><br/>Badger History Group flyer: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRhghSeTETvOp46ETeJIbAkERAgQGyjy/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRhghSeTETvOp46ETeJIbAkERAgQGyjy/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_history_flyer.pdf</a><br/>Badger Ammo Plant - A Different View: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvxlEx6n_NK1LJlyGZq9YyTMDorA0KLI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EvxlEx6n_NK1LJlyGZq9YyTMDorA0KLI/view?usp=drive_link">gdocs/ badger_plant_flyer.pdf</a></p><p>I'm not sure if I was supposed to take that last one. It seems like an original flyer from the 90s before the plant was decommissioned.</p><p>Overall, the museum had a far different vibe than any war museum I've visited in Japan (except for <a href="/old/v6/historical-records" title="/historical-records">the Historical Records Office</a> in Takayama). There was an overall underlying sense of pride of what was created here that never hinted at any guilt or responsibility of what would become of their product. All of the information seemed to focus on facts and presented the information like you could gleefully put yourself in the shoes of the workers.</p><p>I suppose when you "win" the war, you can gloss over the gravity of events that got you to the finish line.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 31, 2025<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 28, 2025</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">St Croix River Riverboat</h3><p>Stillwater is a classic midwestern city that tries its best to embrace its Minnesotan and Wisconsin history.

The event was produced by Sound in Motion, the same folks who have been doing the majority of clubbing events in Minneapolis for around 25 years and have brought incredible talent through our town.</p><p>The event was held at Crave, a two-story restaurant downtown. The event was going to be held on the exposed roof of the restaurant, but because of thunderous rains, it was relocated to the main floor. We had to go through metal detectors and security to get into the restaurant as they finished moving a bunch of tables out of the way, and set up the decks.</p><p>There was an opener for the first hour who I thought was pretty good. He built a progressive house opening set. Not super high energy, but a very solid set that moved from track to track. I asked some folks for his name, but no one seemed to know.</p><p>The second opener, Leo Himself, took over the decks around 11pm. I figured he would have transitioned his set from the opener's final track, but he did not. He killed the set, and started up his first track. His first track had promise. It definitely sounded something like Anjuna. The he transitioned into another familiar track, a recent remix of an old Sasha set track.</p><p>But as his set continued to move from song to song, it became more and more standard house and EDM. Very low layering from track to track. One pop to the next. Too much candy. No real message. I typed in my phone, "I'm not sure why you would tear down your vibe to transition to the next track :/"</p><p>It was a fun distraction before midnight when Spencer Brown arrived and began his set. I didn't take many notes because I was really enjoying the vibe. It was nice to be able to be in the moment and enjoy myself instead of thinking about everything wrong with the world and the future. Unfortunately, like all moments, it didn't last. Dread, jet lag, low energy. Gotta get the old man home.

Or, if someone bought the building to live in, maybe they bought the building with everything in it?</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2479_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Upstairs, there were four rooms, but only two of them had chalkboards. In my experience, remote elementary schools tend to combine 1st and 2nd grade, 3rd and 4th, and 5th and 6th together as three homerooms total. I only count 3 chalkboards in the building. Maybe that downstairs science room was converted later. Or maybe, when they built this school building, they only needed to teach 5 or fewer children, so the school split them into two homerooms.</p><p>There weren't many remnants of a school on the top floor, though. The room to the right was completely open and lined with tatami mats. The middle room had an old wooden desk with some Japanese kanji drill books. And the store room in the middle room had cases of beer and sake. The open tatami room was mostly liked used as a banquet drinking room for the remaining adults in the village.</p><p>The other room on the left had a table and some comfortable seeting. It was probably last used as a meeting room.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2518_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Much of the paint looked like it was rotting away and peeling on the wall. The curtains were tattered and thin, weakened from being baked in the years of hot sunlight. Floor tiles no longer adhered to the ground. Ceiling tiles also showed spots of water damage, and some hung a bit low.</p><p>Everywhere was covered in dust, dirt, and animal droppings in some spaces. But, there weren't any smells. And it wasn't overly dusty in the air. However, even though I was wearing a mask, about a week later I had a terrible cough and lost my voice for a day. Another nearby branch school was demolished due to asbestos detected throughout the building, so maybe I got poisoned? It took me nearly a month to recover. I thought I was already careful with my mask, gloves, and washing up after getting home, but maybe it wasn't enough.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_07_takanuma/IMG_2569_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Takanuma Branch School lies on Hwy 471 connecting all the neighborhoods of Toga Valley from the main village down to Tonami and Nanto.

Every city, town, and village had their centralized schools, but in the mountains and valleys, daily travel was nowhere near as easy as it is today.</p><p>In the 5 valleys of southwestern Toyama, known as Gokayama <span class='ja'>五箇山</span>, the area was split into 3 villages. The central-most village, Taira village, had two elementary schools, Shimonashi ES and Higashi Nakae ES. Higashi Nakae Elementary School was first established back in 1873 during the Meiji restoration. </p><p>I'm not really sure what the people in these mountain valleys did for education before then. Probably nothing. Probably no need as the children would grow up into farmers like everyone else in their home and village. And even with this elementary school established, there were other more rural pocket settlements further up and down the mountain and river who couldn't attend the school, especially in winter.</p><p>After World War II, with more money given to education, the government began building many many branch schools for the centralized schools. The Sugio Branch School was one such school. The full title of the school was <span class='ja'>平村立東中江小学校杉尾分校</span> or Tiara Village Higashi Nakae Elementary School - Sugio Branch School. </p><p>The Sugio neighborhood was only 5 kilometers north up the river, but it was on the other side of that river and there were no bridges. If students were to join school, they would have to travel by boat. So, the government built a branch school for the few students living in Sugio.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2086_t.webp" /></a></p><p>I'm not exactly sure when the school opened, but Sugio Branch school had its own branch school, <a href="/old/v6/donohara-winter-branch-school" title="/donohara-winter-branch-school">the Donohara Winter Branch School</a>. That school was completed in 1957, so the main branch must've been completed before. Both schools operated for less than 20 years before they were closed in March 1972. The reasons for closure were a combination of further rural depopulation in Japan and advances in transportation. Paved roads, bridges, tunnels, and snow sheds now connected most areas of Gokayama allowing for smooth daily travel. Schools had busses that could pick up the dozen or so students remaining in these pocketed areas.</p><p>After its closure as a school, the Sugio Branch School continued to operate as a nature experience center. During summer, it seems like nearly all the older elementary students in the village visited the school to learn about woodworking and craftsmanship.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2117_t.webp" /></a></p><p>It's crazy how many children are in this photo compared to the population of the area today. This photo doesn't have a date, but I would guess it was the late 70s or early 80s. Since then, all the branch schools in Taira had closed, and Shimonashi ES and Higashi Nakae ES combined in 1999 to form Taira ES. 5 years later, municipal mergers were enacted across Japan and all areas of Gokayama merged with Nanto City. Taira ES was combined in Kamitaira ES in 2004.</p><p>Today, I would guess that the entire student population of Kamitaira ES is about the same or less than the number of students (maybe only sixth graders?) in the above photo.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2271_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After a while, the building was designated as a community center.

The eldery members of this now small neighborhood probably used the building to get together every year, talk about happenings, and then have a party afterward. (All organizations and communities do this in Japan.)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2186_t.webp" /></a></p><p>There were glasses in the drying rack, which seemed like people were still probably using the kitchen. There was a lot of firefighting equipment near the entrance, so maybe the volunteer firefighters used the sink for water after doing drills.</p><p>The kitchen is one of the oldest parts of the building. While all schools have their own kitchens, branch schools were unique in that homeroom teachers would live in the buildings. Just as weather would make it dangerous for students to travel to the main school, it would be dangerous for teachers to make the trek to the branch school each day. So, while the branch school was in use, the teacher would live there.</p><p>There was a 5-point scale used to determine the remoteness of a branch school. This grading was determined by how difficult travel would be to a grocery store, post office, and other social facilities. Each full point on the scale added a bonus factor to the teacher's salary for the time they had to live in the school.</p><p>Sugio wasn't too far away from the main village, so it was probably rated as a 2 or 3 at best.</p><p>Next to the kitchen were the bathrooms. They seemed slightly newer than the kitchen, so I think they were converted at one point. This is probably where a bath was for the teacher living here.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_03_sugio/IMG_2189_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Going down the hall there was a really clean room. It was probably used recently for a community meeting and drinking party. There were tables and cusions.

I think that small party room was a new addition, so maybe the gym area was much more open taking up the entire ground floor? The living or sleeping room for that teacher must've been so so small. </p><p>I'm not sure how someone could stand living here. You would almost never have any privacy.
