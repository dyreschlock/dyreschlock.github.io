Is there some Roberta Williams rival going on that I don't know about?  I guess with the release of Manhunt 2, they're trying to pull in similarities since Phantasmagoria is one of the goriest games to ever be released.</p><p>What better day than Halloween for me to write about it as well. ^_^</p><p>Here are the two articles, complete with youtube videos..<br/><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/phantasmagoria-makes-murder-look-as-sexy-as-it-was-in-the-old-days-49210.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/phantasmagoria-makes-murder-look-as-sexy-as-it-was-in-the-old-days-49210.phtml">Article #1: Phantasmagoria makes murder sexy</a><br/><a href="http://www.destructoid.com/why-phantasmagoria-is-awesome-and-why-it-could-never-be-released-today--52024.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/why-phantasmagoria-is-awesome-and-why-it-could-never-be-released-today--52024.phtml">Article #2: Why phantasmagoria would never be released today</a></p><p>Looking at the "gore" and murder today is far more comical than horrific, like it was supposed to be back in the day.  A lot of these murders are more submissive and sexual given a man overpowering a woman and killing her in bizarre methods..</p><div class='title'><b>Nostalgia</b></div><p>My first brush with Phantasmagoria was at a relative's house.  They had it on their computer along with Sim City 2000 and a couple other games.  I was playing Sim City for a little while and noticed Phantasmagoria and wanted to play it.  They gave me the 'ol.. "No no.. this game is for adults" speech.  O_o..  I really wasn't THAT young at this point in time..  I guess they didn't want to get in trouble with my parents or something..</p><p>Later on in the week, I asked my Dad if he'd buy me the game and a day or two later, huzzah!  Phantasmagoria for the Macintosh Power PC was mine!  Next time I'm home, I really need to search around for that game..  It's gotta be somewhere..  even though, it wouldn't be able to run on anything these days.  (at least, nothing i own)</p><p>The game was 7 discs: one for each chapter.  It reminded me a lot of my Sega CD games, like Sewer Shark and Texas Ground Zero.  Nothing but Full Motion Video mixed in with gameplay elements..</p><div class='title'><b>Playing the game</b></div><p>Unfortunately, I didn't get very far in the game.  I completed disc 1, but nothing interesting really happened..  I got a little bit into disc 2, but got stuck and didn't know what to do..  It seemed kinda boring..  I popped in the other discs to see if I could watch the FMV or something, but I actually found something much more useful..  You could begin any chapter you wanted with finishing those before it.  Keen!</p><p>I immediately went to disc 7 to try and beat the game.  Disc 7 really had no exploring at all.  You husband, Don, was completely possessed by the ghost in the mansion, and you're running for you life.  You find a couple items while trying to escape but eventually get caught.</p><p>You wake up from unconsciousness to find Don strapping you into a killing machine.  With the items you have on you, you must escape his clutches.  Apparently, you're supposed to distract him, escape from the chair, and seal the evil vortex in the basement.  I could never do it correctly..  whatever item combination I was supposed to use, I either didn't have or it was not obvious.</p><p>I found a hammer earlier, so I beat Don over the head with it. That certainly distracted him long enough for me to escape the chair before it sliced my head in two..  but then I run down to the basement and I'm giving one chance to do something about this vortex.  All I have is a fricken hammer..  I must've missed something on the way..  Oh well, too late.. the demon came out of the vortex and tore my face off.</p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>I'd love to go back and play through the whole game, even though it is horribly dated.  I never played any of the Kings Quest or Police Quest games, so this is really my only connection to Roberta Williams..</p><p>These games had really died off thanks to the advancement of modern gaming.  Between gameplay and graphics, story telling on par with motion pictures never really came into the picture.  These days, every single game involves some type of story presented in a very cinematic way.  If your game doesn't have a story, then it's crap.</p><p>The only adventure games you can find these days are on platforms that haven't become graphically intense enough to match modern console gaming..  like the Flash Player and Nintendo DS.  Phoenix Wright and Touch Detective are king on the DS for this reason, but are still over looked because "it's like reading a book."  Their console counterparts are much more alluring.  You want to play the story, not Choose-your-own-adventure.</p><p>After Phantasmagoria, Williams made one more King's Quest game and then effectively retired from gaming in 1998.  Nearly a decade has past, but her games still live on in gamers.  Especially Destructoid writers ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 31, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 30, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Heroes Speculation</h3><p>At the end of last night's episode Hero, the plot for the whole season seemed to emerge.  Especially with the trailer for the next episode.  Peter makes his way to Canada, finds stuff in the helix marked apartment and moves into the future with the irish girl.  They find themselves in downtown New York (against a green screen), where the streets are deserted and full of trash..  A slightly different apocolyptic vision than Hiro saw last season..</p><p>Hiro went into the future twice in season 1.  The first time was a glimpse of New York right before "the bomb" went off.  The second time was a few years after that with New York in ruins and the public going ape-shit after mutants.</p><p>The future that Peter has traveled to shows that by stopping "the bomb" last season, they did INDEED change the future.  I guess we already knew that, though..  The date and time of "the bomb's" explosion had already passed from what it should have been.</p><p>Peter picks up a piece of paper that reads "Evacution, June 2008", which puts them near the date of the final episode of Season 2.  The trailer goes on to say that 93% of the population was killed by a virus.. Most likely, the very virus Mohinder and Bob were talking about earlier to reverse mutants back into normal humans.  Looks like, in the future, Mohinder has failed in suspressing the company from making a virus/vacine..</p><p>It seems like they're following the same pattern from last season.  Catching a glimspe into the future reveals a catastrophic event only they can stop.  Save the cheerleader, Save the world..  what's the tagline going to be this time?  Stop the company, Save the world?  Stop parker's father, save the world?</p><p>I wonder when the first hiatus is....<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 30, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 28, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Freaks and Geeks further thoughts</h3><p>After purchasing the Freaks and Geeks box set on Friday, I've really binged on the show.  Between Friday and Saturday morning, I watched the first 3 of the DVDs, totaling 9 episodes, an hour each.  Saturday night, I watched the next 2 DVDs by myself, and now I'm down to one remaining.</p><p>The more you get into this show, the formula really begins to set in.  I think the best way to describe this show is a mix between an after-school special, That 70s Show, and the Wonder years.  Most of the geeky jokes in the movie are really time centric with taking place in 1980.  A star wars reference here..  a star trek reference there..  Dallas, Welcome back Cotter..  It's the same formula that That 70s Show did until it began focusing on the characters.</p><p>This show has really begun to depress me, so I'm not really sure why I decided to binge on another six episodes..  I guess I couldn't stay away..  I think I'm going to lock up those final 3 episodes to watch them later on in the future.  How fitting that these final 3 episodes were never aired until ABC family picked up the syndication rights..</p><p>My old Madison roommates are somewhat on the same mind, but with Knocked Up, inside of Freaks and Geeks.  One of them relates to that movie with the same disdain because that was a life he almost lead.  The same feelings of entrapment and solid future were those he couldn't handle.</p><div class='title'><b>Suburbia</b></div><p>Freaks and Geeks really reminds me of the first Richard Linklater movie I saw..  Suburbia.  The first time I saw this movie, I was in awe with its realism.  Much like Freaks and Geeks, It really stuck with me for the next couple of days.</p><p>I've only seen it once, so I'm somewhat hazy on what point in time it takes place.  It was the last night in early September before all these high school friends went to college, the army, and another had a record deal.  This was the last day of their lives as citizen of their suburban town before they ventured into the world.  I think the year was 1985, or something like that.</p><p>Since it was their last night, they went through a wide range of emotions..  celebration, excitement, fear, loss..  pre-mature homesickness..  Their venture into the unknown..  A world outside theiir own.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>I saw this movie when I was a sophomore or junior in high school, so I viewed it as the same sort of fears I was supposed to have once I finished high school..  except I had no clue what the hell I was going to do at the time.</p><p>I was somewhat excited for this moment to happen for me..  To be at that point of no return with my high school friends, say goodbye for the final time and really feel for each other..  That never came for me..  Really, It was only until the end of last year and leaving Japan that I had that moment..  A conversation that ended on the tone that I would never see you again and I'm glad I met you...</p><p>That moment was real..  The moment was heartfelt..  With all my other friends in Japan..  I just turn on my computer and they're all on Instant Messenger..  but with that one person and that one moment.  It was the edge of the universe..</p><div class='title'><b>Scanner Darkly</b></div><p>Out of all other Linklater's movies, Scanner Darkly is the only other one that scratches at my emotions on some level.  There's only a few scenes that convey that slice of life feel, but I see myself in them none-the-less.  I think I'll leave it at that though...</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Now that I've seen Freaks and Geeks, I must see Undeclared.  I must see Judd Apatow's second building block of his cast of social rejects..  but, I really don't want to buy it.  I love Freaks and Geeks, but I probably could have gotten away with just borrowing it from someone..  I'll probably watch it again with someone who hasn't seen it, but never on my own.</p><p>There are a bunch of other TV shows I'd like to see too, like My So Called Life (as recommended by Erika), Californication, Weeds, Carnivale...  I'd also like to pick up where I left off with Six Feet Under (even though, Matt says the rest is dull).</p><p>Soooo....  maybe I'll start up a netflix account.  After comparing Blockbuster online versus Netflix, I think I'll definitely go with Netflix.  If Blockbuster had a video game service mixed in with DVDs, then there'd be no contest, but they don't.  And with their prices exactly the same, It really comes down to selection and with more Television shows, Anime, and obscure foreign movies Netflix has Blockbuster beat. Also, If I miss an episode of Heroes, I can watch it from netflix.com rather than nbc's crappy browser player.</p><p>I wonder how long it would take to get Undeclared disc 1 if I signed up now....<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 28, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 27, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Freaks and Geeks</h3><p>Last night, I picked up the boxset of Freaks and Geeks, which contains all 18 episodes of the short-lived series.  I've so many things about this show and after watching Knocked Up and Superbad, I was really excited for it.  We watched about 6 or 7 episodes last night, and watched the remainder of the third disc this morning.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I really thought this show was going to be much more of a comedy than a drama.  I figured it was more on the lines of Undeclared, but I was way off.  I also thought each episode was going to be 30 minutes, but I was off on that too.  There's a lot more to this show than I expected which really through me back..</p><p>Freaks and Geeks is about freaks and geeks..  Set in 1980, it centers on Sam Weir, a freshmen high school who fails into the geek category of the show.  And centers on Lindsey Weir who is a junior or senior at the same high school.  She rejects her 'braininess' and wants to hang out with the 'cool' kids.. the 'freaks' category, which would be burnouts.</p><p>This show is incredible.  It is incredibly real and way too accurate that it's almost too much for me.  Freaks and Geeks fills me with so much sentiment, nostalgia, and memories of my own life in high school.  Good times, Bad times..  It's not like watching Back to the Future for the first time in 10 years and thinking back to the first time you saw this masterpiece..  It's living your life again..  too many social cares..  rejection..  affliation..  acceptance..  It's like watching a home movie of your life at age 14.</p><p>This slice of life is too big for me to handle..  It's really not a case of whether I like this show or not..  I feel like this show is me..  It's too good..  which is why it was cancelled. :/</p><p>I'll probably watch the rest of it tonight and tomorrow.</p><div class='title'><b>Judd Appatow</b></div><p>After Freaks and Geeks was cancelled, Judd Apatow (co-creator) went with a more comedic approach to the 'Freaks and Geeks' feel..  Undeclared was his next show, which featured 'Freaks and Geeks' in college.  Jocks became Frat boys..  Cheerleaders became Sorority girls..  but the social outcasts, where still outcasts.</p><p>It premiered on Fox, which probably doomed the show from the start.  It also only lasted one season.  I only remember seeing part of an episode, but I don't really remember it.  From what I remember, this is way more lighthearted than Freaks and Geeks.</p><p>Apparently, Judd Apatow has three other unaired television series that seem similar.  "Life on Parole", "North Hollywood", and "Sick in the Head".  Pilots were created for these three series, but they were very aired.</p><p>I guess the average TV viewer and Judd Apatow don't mix.  It's a damn shame though..  As far as popularity though, Apatow really struck it rich in the movies..  He hung with Will Ferril for a bit, and produced Anchorman, Kicking & Screaming (will ferril's crappy soccer movie), and Talladega Nights.</p><p>But his real talent lies in bringing slices of life into the theater..  He still comes back to the 'Freaks and Geeks' social groups, and made 3 movies in different points in time.  At the age 40 timeline, there's 40 year old virgin.  At the age 23-25 timeline, there's knocked up.  And at the age 18 timeline, there's Superbad.  You may not be the main characters in these movies, but chances are there's a character you relate to.</p><p>Another interesting fact is that Seth Rogen is in all 5 of Apatow's "slice of life" dramedies, and also several other actors and actresses as well.  Judd Apatow really doesn't give much direction when working with his talents, he produces these movies highlighting his talent's natural persona and let's them go loose.</p><div class='title'><b>Six Degrees of Separation</b></div><p>Besides Seth Rogen, Apatow reuses a lot of the talent that has been in his properties, and even the talent themselves have appeared in other films and TV together..  maybe its because when someone makes a geeky or burnout movie, these guys are the best candidates?  maybe its coincidence..?  fate..?  or perhaps they just like each ^_^.</p><p>I made <a href="/pages/apatow.html" title="/pages/apatow.html">a page</a> with all these social links.  Thank you, IMDB.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 27, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 24, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Further Beautiful Katamari Thoughts</h3><p>After being so pissed off at Beautiful Katamari on the first day, and ranting about how annoying stupid the game is.. tonight I was able to get passed that and play through the game thinking of fond memories of We Love Katamari..</p><div class='title'><b>Stages</b></div><p>All told, Beautiful Katamari has 16 stages..  10 main stages, 2 variety stages, and 4 downloadable stages which are released today on Xbox Live marketplace.  How many stages did We Love Katamari have?  Weren't there 8 main stages, and 8 or 10 variety stages?</p><p>We Love Katamari had some very pretty innovative levels.. like the cloud level, where you only roll up clouds.  the firefly level, where you're at a camp site in the evening, and roll up all the fireflies you see.  During the credits, you could roll up all the continents on earth..  and There was another level where you could roll up all the planets and satellites you've made throughout the game.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari has one rather unique level which is unlocked after you complete the game.  You are rolling around the King through his infancy, through his childhood, up to adulthood.  Throughout this process, the King asks you to roll up specific items to "jog" his memory of his lifetime.  "Roll up ocean objects.. it reminds me of my adventures on the sea," he says.  This level has no time limit, so you can really have fun with it.</p><div class='title'><b>Scale</b></div><p>With each successive Katamari game, they push the eventual maximum size you can reach, usually by limiting the size of the levels.  In Katamari Damacy, you started the size of a thumbtack, and grew big enough to roll around on island picking up skyscrappers and huge forests.  We Love Katamari did them on better, in the final stage, you grow big enough to escape the island and roll up other islands, eventually getting big enough to roll up the island you began on..  eventually, the maximum size you could reach was between 3,000 and 4,000 meters.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari grows exponentially larger than that..  Quite similarly, the final level you begin about the size of a potted plant, and continue to grow.  When you reach the size you were in We Love Katamari, you're able to escape the little island region you began on and can roll around the world picking up massive forests and island countries..  This is A LOT like the ending of We Love Katamari where you pick up continents.  Eventually you grow large enough to pick up all the continents on earth, and big enough to escape Earth.  Then you float around space picking up other planets, and eventually Earth..  This is much like that special level in We Love Katamari.</p><p>So, you began the size of a bread basket and grow larger than the Sun to a maximum total of around 1,500,000 kilometers..  Unfortunately, you can't reach that diameter until you unlock the extra 4 levels for their planets to be in that level to roll up.</p><p>Despite it's failings, the final main level, and the King level are pretty fun..  A reward for walking through all the shit to get there.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, the game is still unimaginative and only offers Scale as a new feature.  Where We Love Katamari was making steps in the right direction, Beautiful Katamari took all those steps back and offers very little with an occasionally broken points system.</p><p>I'm a big fan of Katamari, so I kept with it.  I think most people would probably quit after getting constantly beat down on those first couple of levels.  There really isn't a reason to keep going, unless you really want to play the final level.</p><p>Today, on Xbox Live, you can purchase 4 additional levels that should have been included with the game for $10 total..  I will probably purchase them to see what they really offer..  They are probably 4 variety levels, so, once again, I have my hopes up for something that'll blow me away as some of the levels in We Love Katamari did.</p><div class='title'><b>In other news</b></div><p>I picked up Castlevania on PSP today, but I want to finish up with Beautiful Katamari and Gurumin first, before playing it..  Technically, I beat Gurumin already, but I got the sad ending.  To get the good ending, I need to go through and finish all the stages in the game, of which I missed 5 or 6. So there's not much left to do.  Gurumin is a great game, btw ^_^. I could finish that up in one night, easily.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 24, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 23, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Beautiful Katamari Impressions</h3><p>Last night, I went on a brisk walk down to Gamestop to pick up Castlevania and Phoenix Wright, but unfortunately I was a day too early.. Apparently games come out on Wednesday these days.. On the way back I stopped off at Circuit City, Shopko, and eventually found myself at Blockbuster. What luck! They had copies of Beautiful Katamari in stock, which was released for the 360 last week.</p><p>I probably would've already owned the game, except $40 is entirely too much for this game, even without knowing if it was any good. The rental price of $8 seemed the perfect fit.</p><p>Unfortunately, every aspect of Beautiful Katamari seems inferior or par to its previous console title, We Love Katamari. There are two things that are identical to We Love Katamari, the graphics and the loading times.</p><div class='title'><b>Par Graphics</b></div><p>Beautiful Katamari looks identical to We Love Katamari.. The same blocky environment and 3D models are all present in this new "High-Def" presentation. The same solid color lack-of-textured items cover the environment for you to roll up into your Katamari.</p><p>With the power of the 360 behind this game, you'd think they'd do something innovative with the graphics.. Perhaps add a ton of objects into the universe, rather than the slightly more than you'd find on a PS2. Why not extend the graphics just a little more, or have more diverse objects? Beautiful Katamari has 1000 unique objects.. the same amount as We Love Katamari.</p><div class='title'><b>Par Loading Times</b></div><p>Also on with PS2 are the loading times.. Does it really take the 360 the same time to load a Playstation 2 quality environment as the Playstation 2? When you move from area to area why does it load on occasion? Why is there still a little bit of loading when you grow to a certain size? It doesn't make sense why you would need so much loading for this game... This is pure laziness..</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Gameplay</b></div><p>The main gameplay concept of Katamari is to roll around, pick up objects, and increase your ball larger and larger until your Katamari's diameter meets the goal for the level before the timer runs out. We Love Katamari added some new innovations by having other goals, like rolling up food, clouds, fireflies in some beautiful environments.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari takes both these concepts and rolls them into the main goal of the level. You still have size requirements and a timer, but on each level, your katamari must contain a majority of a certain group of items. One level, you begin rolling around in a Casino and the majority of items must be expensive things. In every level I've played, this has been the goal.</p><p>Once you complete the level, you are scored on how big your katamari is and how well you followed instructions. It's basically a percentage though, since the max score is 100 points. You score dramatically drops if your Katamari isn't majority of that group. I think you need to score, at least, a certain amount of points to open up new levels.</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Controls</b></div><p>The placement of the sticks on the 360 controller really hurt the comfortability of Katamari. It doesn't feel terribly awkward, but it gets in my way every now and then. There's no balance of symmetry with the 360 controller like there was on the Playstation 2. This works great for 360 games where the right stick always controls movement, but not for Katamari. Katamari requires both sticks be used in unison and without balance, it can slow down your movements. Cross Chatter between hemispheres.</p><p>Also, the sticks are more rough than the Playstation 2 sticks. The ps2 sticks used a very small swivel radius which made the stick move very dramatically. On the 360, the radius is quite a bit larger, so when you move the stick up, it doesn't change its angle too much. This is probably more of a personal preference though, since I played the Playstation 2 titles to death.</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Level Design</b></div><p>I haven't quite put my finger on it yet, but I really suck at most of these levels. In most cases, when starting out, I can hardly pick up anything. I have to search around for little things to pick up, rather than having an equal abundance of all items. It always seems like I'm always one step behind of what the level designers want me to be picking up.</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Story</b></div><p>The story in Katamari was pretty simple. The King of all Cosmos broke all the stars and you must replace them in the night sky. So, as the prince, you roll around crap to rebuild stars in the sky.</p><p>We Love Katamari expanded on this by the King accidentally knocking out all the planets. So, you roll around crap to replace planets, meteors and other things in space. As you rolled along, though, you would find out more about the King, and yourself as well. The story was actually pretty fun, and told in hilarious Katamari style, with vocals and cutscenes.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari starts off with text, no vocals, about how the King, yet again, broken the universe, and you must roll up the planets again. Really? Could you not think of a better story or at least a different story? and then tell it in a worse more boring fashion? jesus..</p><div class='title'><b>Inferior Price</b></div><p>Despite all its failings, the number one problem with this game is price. Katamari Damacy was release at $20. People bought the crap out of it, and loved it. It was the perfect price point. We Love Katamari annoyed people with it's $30 price tag when it came out a year and a half later, but it wasn't too bad. We Love Katamari offered much more than the original and was still a joy to play.</p><p>Beautiful Katamari is $40.. The same cost as a new Playstation 2 game. With the $30 We Love Katamari price, people took a step back and considered their purchase rather than just buying it as they did with the $20 Katamari Damacy. $40 is certainly cheaper than $60 or $50, but for Katamari? That is expensive.. especially those people new to series looking at the back of the box.</p><p>After playing it for 2 hours last night, the innovation doesn't even stack up its previous version. You can't charge more for a worse product, even if it is on a next-gen machine.</p><p>But wait there's more.. With the release of Beautiful Katamari, the Xbox live marketplace has 4 new downloadable levels already, for 200 points each. Already more levels to download, huh? So, what you're telling me, is that you shipped an unfinished game and now I have to pay an additional $10 for 4 more levels to complete it? That's bullshit.</p><p>So Beautiful Katamari is really $50 for the full game.. which is more than anyone should spend on a Playstation 2 game these days. $40 is almost too much for a Playstation 2 game unless it's fully featured and kick ass.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict?</b></div><p>This game is crap.. it's a more expensive inferior version of its Playstation 2 predecessors. I want more Katamari, but this game is annoying to play and not worth the price of admission. If you really want to play, definitely rent it and see for yourself.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 23, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 17, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">PSP - Gurumin Impressions</h3><p>This week saw the release of Beautiful Katamari..  a game series that I hold close to my heart, but not close enough that I would spend the $40 budget price tag of the next-generation to own it..  Not right now anyways..  I'd take advantage of that Toys R Us deal, but I can't find a third act to follow :/</p><p>Distraught and disappointed, I came home and decided to start playing some PSP games..  but I was looking for something a little more than just an hour of a puzzle rhythm game.  Out of my 20 PSP games, I'd say 14 are not very involved games.. so that narrowed the field down.</p><p>I had Valkyrie Profile, Metal Gear Solid, Generation of Chaos, Final Fantasy VII and one other story driven game that really caught my eye: Gurumin.  subtitle: a monsterous adventure.</p><div class='title'><b>Appeal</b></div><p>This was one of those games that looked like I would really like it just from looking at the cover.  It had a funny super-deformed character with several other colorful characters behind lighting up the canvas with intrigue.  I took a look at the back of the box, and it looked like some medievil adventure style game.  A very japanese non-mainstream title..</p><p>When gamestop marked Gurumin down to $20 back in May, I gladly picked it up.  Kinda sad when a game gets reduced in price 50% 3 months after release.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Gurumin is about a girl named Parin.  Parin had just moved to a quite mining town in the middle of no where populated only by adults.  Or so it seemed, after running around town she comes across a little child being harassed by a dog.  Parin leeps to her rescue and beats away the mean dog.</p><p>This child's named is Pico (i think) and she isn't actually a child..  She's a monster.  Her brother Puco quickly comes to the scene and tries to save Pico from you.  Both Puco and Pico are surprised that Parin can see them, as they are not visible to adults in the town.  Puco and Pico lead you to a hole in the town's wall where you are whisked away to the monster town.</p><p>The monster town is home to many playful and interesting monsters, but it's not too long until Puco is kidnapped by evil phantoms.  This is where the towns-monsters call on your for help.  In the center of the village is an ancient weapon that only a true hero could weild.  She/he who can pull it out of the ground, is its' rightful master.</p><p>Of course, it's no problem for you..  You pull out the weapon and huzzah!  The weapon is an ancient drill that has been known to slay the evil phantom menance in the past.</p><p>Anyways, You run out to save Puco, but it's all a diversion.  In your absense, the monster town is destroyed by the phantoms and evil mist covers the once beautiful monster land.</p><p>Even though, you've been playing for about 40 minutes, this is the point where the plot of the game really begins.  With the town in ruins, you travel back into the monster land and recover pieces of the shattered village and inspiration your monster friends to rebuild.</p><div class='title'><b>Looks</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of those playful kiddy adventure games that found a home on the Playstation back in the day.  Much like Megaman Legends, Tail Concerto and Brave Fencer Musashiden.  You play a cute little character, fighting monsters.. but all the enemies are very non-threatening and have brilliant colors and cute tones.  It's a Japanese kids game. ^_^</p><p>Also akin to those games, Gurumin is fully 3D with very simply textures and models..  It reminds me so much of a PS1 game because it looks just like a PS1 game, except the image quality on the PSP removes all those jagged edges and really smooths out everything.</p><p>I've been playing this on one of those new PSP Slim and Lites, and I've noticed a fair amount of ghosting with Parin's little red pigtail ribbons.  Whenever she moves quickly, her hair will jerk to the side and the ghosting is very apparent.  It doesn't really bother me though, and its only really noticable when she's on a dark background.</p><div class='title'><b>Role Playing Aspects</b></div><p>Anyways, Gurumin is an action RPG.  You have your weapons, your equipment and your HP.  You never really change weapons, but you can upgrade it.  Living in a mining town has its advantages..  just down the road you have your drill expert that can teach you new tricks with your drill...  He'll give 'em to you for free, but you'd much rather pay for them than owe favors.</p><p>Leveling is kinda funny in this game.  You have 3 power bars for your weapon and whenever you successful defeat an enemy, or break part of the environment, it'll start charging up your bar.  Once you power up a single bar, your weapon will gain a level and do more damage.  If you get hurt by an enemy, it'll decrease your power bar which can result in losing levels.</p><p>The only equipment I've found so far has been headgear.  Each piece of headgear has certain effects.  The store owner gives you goggles right off the bat, which help prevent water damage.  You can buy new pieces of equipment if you want, but you can also upgrade the equipment you own for increased effects.  These upgrades don't cost money, but do cost Junk.</p><p>Junk are broken pieces of weapons and armor you usually tear off of phantoms while you fight them.  Most phantom wear a funny hat, or carry a shield.  When you fight them, you'll eventually knock it off of them and you'll collect it.</p><p>So far, I haven't found a way to increase my max HP, but I'd guess they are items you can use to permanently increase your max health.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>As an action RPG, you simple run around levels and beat the crap out of enemies.  The attacking system is really nice.  Sure, you can spam the attack button all you want, but you can buy new powerful moves to use against enemies too.  So far, I've purchase a spin attack and a ground smash attack.</p><p>There's actually a slight bit of strategy in using these attacks too.  When you're surounded by enemies, using the spin attack is actually more helpful than spamming the regular attack button, or jumping out of the way and attacking them one by one.  It's a useful attack.</p><p>You can also charge your attack, and coming drilling into battle rather than normal attacks.  Charging your drill is also very good for destroying chunks of the wall and pillars to find money and secret passage ways when in a dungeon.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallels</b></div><p>Gurumin really reminds me of Drill Dozer, but they are completely different games.  Released on the Gameboy Advance, Drill Dozer preceeded Gurumin by 8 or 9 months and features similar concepts.</p><p>Parallel 1) You both play little girls using the power of a drill.  In Drill Dozer, Jill actually climbs into a drilling machine which kills enemies and destroys walls and pillars.  In Gurumin, Parin's drill is more of a spear.  The drill tip spear head is plunged into enemies.</p><p>Parallel 2) Both drills have a 3 part leveling system which is not permanent.  In Drill Dozer, you begin each stage at level 0.  Throughout the stage, you pick up gears which will allow you to charge your drill longer and present a greater attack.  In Gurumin, each successful kill increase your level all the way up to 3.  At each level, your drill is stronger, but you charge your attacks the same regardless of level.</p><p>I suppose Parallel 3) would be the charging of your shots are dependent on a 3 part leveling system where the higher the level the more powerful the charge shot.</p><p>But both games are of two different genres.  Gurumin is an action RPG, whereas Drill Dozer is a side-scroller.  I suppose both games are stage driven though and you unlock more stages as you continue into the game.  You can also visit previous stages you've beaten.</p><p>Drill Dozer is a fantastic game, by the way, and it'd definitely recommend it.  It's made by Game Freak after they finished Pokemon Emerald and before they began working on the next-generation of Pokemon games currenty out now.</p><div class='title'><b>Cute</b></div><p>Gurumin is a very lovable game.  You play a funny cute girl who is very rude to the elderly townspeople.  She also pokes fun at the cookie-cutter story too..  The game has some clever item descriptions too, like those Disgaea and Phantom Brave.</p><p>It's really been a joy to play so far, but a little on the easy side.  It's still the beginning though, so there's plenty of time to be challenging.</p><p>After 2 hours of the game, my verdict is quite positiive.  If you like offbeat action rpgs, I'd say definitely go for it.  Gamestop probably has it for slightly cheaper than $20 these days.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 17, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 17, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Capcom's Gamer Day Announcements</h3><p>Today, Capcom has their Gamer's Day out in London, England and with it several interesting announcements had occurred.  One of the biggest announcements was Street Fighter 4.. but that's not really what interested me so much.  Actually, the trailer for Streeet Fighter 4 looks pretty slick.. <a href="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml" title="http://www.destructoid.com/prepare-yourself-street-fighter-4-debut-trailer-49618.phtml">check it out.</a> They also officially announced Apollo Justice, which I'm estactic for, but there's some else that could be interesting.</p><p>Good 'ol <b>Lost Planet</b> we see its release on the Playstation 3.  This is fantastic news.  The Playstation 3 release will include all downloadable content seen on Xbox Live and the PC version of the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Why is this fantastic news?</b></div><p>Well, to be honest Lost Planet is a piece of shit.  The gameplay is restrictive and gets in the way and the final boss is unbeatable even when you knock his life to 0..  <a href="/old/v6/lost-planet" title="/lost-planet">read all about it</a></p><p>Lost Planet coming to Playstation 3 is a gateway.  It means that Capcom is developing a Playstation 3 port of their Lost Planet engine, which was initially developed when making Dead Rising..  This engine was made with love from Keiji Inafune's team in the hopes of one day creating a next-gen Megaman adventure game to the tune of Megaman Legends 3.  That's why there's all those Megaman references in Dead Rising and Lost Planet.</p><p>Making a multi-platform version of their Lost Planet / Dead Rising engine should give them more leverage in pitching the idea of Megaman Legends 3 to the Capcom powers that be.  This also means there's a slight hope for a Playstation 3 Dead Rising port..  or at least Dead Rising 2 on both platforms... or whatever they have next on the engine hitting both platforms.</p><div class='title'><b>others</b></div><p>Capcom also announced a new Sci-fi IP titled Dark Void.. so I wonder if that's the next game for this engine.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 17, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 16, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Sneak King Final Thoughts</h3><p>On second hand though, Sneak King is so monotonous that it gets tiring really fast. I liked playing the first level in the saw mill because it was relatively easy, but the later levels have more challenge and the limitations of the gameplay get in your way of completing your missions</p><div class='title'><b>Short-comings</b></div><p>After playing the same level of Sneak King over and over, you'll begin to notice that all the people in the level aren't randomly generated. Everyone is on a specific track starting in a specific spot whenever you load a mission. Irregardless of where you are in the level, everyone else will begin in the same spot, and usually they'll be hungry at the exact same times.</p><p>Even though this is incredibly lazy programming, it makes the game predictable. You know exact where you have to be at a specific time, and if you screw it up, then do it again. You don't need to take into account random events as you would in real life. This really brings the feeling of the game into a game-like atmosphere and you can improve on your score because of this.</p><p>This is fine for the first level, where people are predictably hungry when they near hiding places, but the second level flips the paradigm upside down. Hardly anyone in this level travels near a hiding place, and when they do, they're either not hungry or start too close to the hiding place for you to hide without them seeing you.</p><p>They cover for this by making nearly all missions in the second level Stealth based, rather than Surprise based. But those few that are hiding are nearly impossible to get an A ranking on. I'm not even sure if it's possible to do so. :/</p><p>I just made it to the third level last night, and there's a night and day difference between that and the previous level. You have a much more open space like at the saw mill, but you have a ton of people that are rarely hungry. Getting around is tough.</p><div class='title'><b>Not enough variety</b></div><p>Like I mentioned in the previous post, nearly all missions are the exact same. You've got a certain number of BK items to give out to people, and you either do it as fast as possible, or with the highest score possible. Sometimes they'll give you restrictions like only give to females, or don't perform a flourish.. Annoying things that prevent you from enjoying the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Burnt out</b></div><p>After playing this game nearly all Sunday, and then another hour on Monday, I don't think i'll be able to play this game again. 7 hours is all the enjoyment I've gotten out of it, and the only thing that really keeps me going is unlocking more achievements. I'm pretty close to unlocking a few more. I've completed around 37 out of 80 missions in the game. I don't think anyone has played this game that far. Gage said he played it for about 10 minutes and got bored.</p><div class='title'><b>Rate this game</b></div><p>So how do you really rate this game? It's horrible programmed.. you can't invert neither axis, and the camera angles screw you on occasions.. but.. it's only $4. You get what you pay for. $4 is cheaper than nearly all Xbox Live games... and it really shows.</p><p>It's because of that $4 price tag that I definitely recommend the game, but you probably won't get much play out of it. You'll find the same things hilarious like I did, but then get absolutely bored with nothing else to do in the game.</p><p>(and) This is supposed to be the better of the 3 Burger King games.. I wonder if the other ones are actually that bad. It difficult to screw up a racing game, but bumper cars? That sounds pretty boring..</p><div class='title'><b>Why does this work?</b></div><p>Something else that kinda puzzles me is "Why does this game work?". Why is the King such a successful mascot that they can make a crappy cheap game on the 360 and have it rise to one of the best selling 360 games of last Christmas season? Let's face facts.. you're only playing this game because of The King.</p><p>Burger King will never reach sales equal to McDonalds, but their marketing plans are great. 2006 was one of their busiest years for marketing. They had 4 marketing campaigns going on at the same too, which was somewhat confusing. They Cock Rock pushing those Chicken Fries, The King doing his normal thing, those Office workers pushing the dollar menu, and that one MAN commercial pushing the steak sandwich... They were pulling out all the stops.</p><p>These days, I haven't really seen any burger king commercials. I occasionally see a crappy McDonalds commercial, and those disgusting Hardees commercials have also made waves on my TV.. I wonder what BK is up to.. Perhaps they're biding their time until the Superbowl again.</p><p>Anyways, The King hits the mark at the perfect amount of goofy and bizarre that drives sales in the 18 to 35 demographic, i guess. Superimposing him into football plays only drives the point home further.</p><div class='title'><b>Hope</b></div><p>Hopefully Burger King will do some more Xbox related games or downloads in the future. I think if they went back and refined Sneak King, it could be a great game... but 80 missions of exactly the same thing is overkill.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 16, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 15, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Xbox 360 - Sneak King </h3><p>Today was one of those rare days where I didn't really have anything to occupy my time.  Usually my Sundays are spent coming back to Madison from wherever I stayed the night before, but today I got back home around 1pm and had the whole day in front of me.  I finally finished up Halo 3, but that only took an hour or two.</p><p>I didn't want to start an involved game since Castlevania comes out in a week..  I was thinking about playing some more Oblivion, but it felt like a waste of time..  But then on the shelf behind me, I saw my vice.  A brilliant gem on the 360 that I was so excited for last year.  I had missed my chance to play it because I was living over seas, but my little brother picked me up a copy..</p><p>Sneak King..  One of three Burger King games released for the Xbox and Xbox 360 last christmas season.  In fact, It was one of the top sellers for the Xbox 360, since it was yours for the low low price of $3.99 with purchase of value meal.  How could you honestly beat that?  That's cheaper than buying a magazine about the 360.</p><p>I spent the rest of the day with my pal, the King and it was great!</p><div class='title'><b>The premise</b></div><p>Sneak King is probably the most market driven of the 3 Xbox Burger King games.  In Sneak King, you play as the king, and must deliver delicious Burger King food items to the hunger people of various environments.  You are judged on 5 things that will multiply your score:  Sneak/Surpise, Hunger, Flourish, Range, Chain.</p><p><em>Sneak/Surpise</em><br/>This is the initial point total of your presentation.  You can simply sneak behind the citizen, but you'll find yourself 5 times the amount of points if you surprise them!  To surprise them, you hide in part of the environment and when they walk by..  you jump out in front of them with a tasty BK treat!</p><p><em>Hunger</em><br/>Of course, you can't give anyone food..  they have to want it.  The king has special mind reading powers that allows him to see how hungry someone is.  When they are at their hungriest.. that is the best time to strike!</p><p><em>Flourish</em><br/>Giving food to someone unsuspecting is great, but you really need to let them have it.  When you pounce on someone you're given a guage much like in a golf game.  Get that thing to full and you'll present the food to them in such a way, they'll be absolutely dazzled.</p><p><em>Range</em><br/>The closer you are to your target, the bigger the surpise!</p><p><em>Chain</em><br/>This is really how you build up your points..  Whenever the King is spotted it throws off his game and he must start again.  The chain is how many chained sneaks you can perform without getting caught.</p><div class='title'><b>The game</b></div><p>Using the gameplay described above, you are presented with several missions in each area.  Missions are generally all the same except with different time restraints, score restraints, and sneak restraints.  All in all, you have 4 different environments with 20 missions included in each.  That's a lot of missions.  It probably took me about 4 or 5 hours to full complete the first area before heading onto the next.</p><p>That first area was sort of split up into 3 sections though, so it wasn't too monotenous, but you're still doing the same thing over and over again.  The different environments provide a change of pace, though.</p><p>The first environment is the saw mill.  You have hungry lumberjacks and workers looking for a quite BK break in the middle of their daunting day.  The second environment is the cul de sack.  The dead end of a suburban street where neighbors are walking around greeting each other and looking for a quite BK break of their daily lives.</p><p>The first environment provided you will ample room and plenty of places to hide and pounce on the hungry inhabitants..  The second environment is much more dense..  They focus on sneaking, rather than surprising.  Even though, you should always hide yourself from the public, they really emphasis that in the second chapter.</p><div class='title'><b>Progress</b></div><p>I just reached halfway through the second world, so I've still got a ways to go if I wish to achievement whore the game.  Sneak King is hilarious and full of flaws..  Quite possibly one of the best B-games on the 360 to date, next to Earth Defense Force..  Definitely check it out if you can find a copy.  It's a good way to spend a Sunday afternoon.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 15, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 14, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Halo 3</h3><p>Today, i finally finished up with Halo 3.  I beat it on Heroic (the true difficulty setting), and proceeded to get my ass kicked in Legendary.  I found all the skulls and accessed all the terminals, so aside from a few other achievements online, I think I'm probably at my limit for the game.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>In order to truly appreciate Halo 3, you should really play through Heroic.  Normal is just way too easy to be taken seriously.  In Heroic, you get a true sense of the enemies actually being strategic when defending or attacking.  The brutes will always send in a little grunt to smoke you out.  They'll chuck grenades down the hall at you and try to cut off escape routes.</p><p>In Normal, you can easily mow down any enemies that stand in your way..  It's really no challenge.  Lately it seems like Normal difficult is the new Easy difficult.  When a casual gamer picks up a game, he doesn't want to play on easy just because he sucks..  He wants Normal just like the big boys.  Developers have been continually dumbing down difficulty levels to the point where the true experience is Hard mode.  The same was with Metroid Prime 3.  Games are getting too easy.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. Legendary difficulty is simply balls out difficult.  I gave up after consistently dying during the first few skirmishes in the jungle.  Penny Arcade was SPOT ON when they said Legendary on Halo 3 is a chore.  There were a few spots in Heroic that were challenging and took me a while, but they weren't difficult.  Heroic was that bowl of porrage that was just the right temperature.  Normal is too cold, and Legendary is too hot.</p><div class='title'><b>Environments</b></div><p>Isn't it rather strange that all the "alien" worlds look exactly like Earth?  True, when you're on a halo you can see the ring continue up into the atmosphere and when you're on the ark, you can see the rims in the distance..  But the actual environments you walk on...  there's nothing alien about them at all.  Why does the ark look exactly like someplace on earth?  Why can't their be bizzare plant-life?  Why don't we ever see indigenous animal life too?</p><p>Metroid Prime 3 has some imaginative places to explore..  Why does something as sacrade as the Ark and a Halo ring look normal?  Maybe that's something I'm missing in the story..</p><p>Also, there really wasn't any epic battle fought on earth the way it was fought in Halo 2.  The second level of Halo 2 had you fighting your way to one of earth's major cities.  In the distance, you could actually see the city and the havoc taking place.  As you fought your way toward it, it would grow on the horizon until you eventually arrived inside that city you had seen from the beginning of the battle.  Then you waged war on the streets and in alleyways.</p><p>In Halo 3, there's nothing like that at all.  The locations you fight on Earth, look like burnt out Army bases and bunkers.  You never fight in a true residential area..  and because of that you never get that emotion attachment to your surrounding to actually feel like Earth is actually in peril.</p><p>On the flip-side, though.. The environments are varied throughout the game, so it's not the same level over and over again.  There's the jungle, an underground bunker, a desert base, base of a mountain, snowy hills, and so forth.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Honestly, I don't think the story of Halo 3 is all that bad.  It's like a fun action movie where you play the unbeatable action hero.  Unfortunately, they really didn't do much with the backstory of the first two games.  I guess Bungie was assuming that if you're playing Halo 3, then you probably played through Halo 1 and 2 and remember the story verbatum.</p><p>Well, even though I have played through Halo 1 and 2, that was so long ago, I hardly even remember it.  I remember a little bit of Halo 2's cop out ending, but I really have no idea what the convenant actually is, nor the real importance of the Halo rings, nor most other stuff.</p><p>Apparently, the extra disc in the limited edition has all the cutscenes from Halo 1 and 2 remastered and cut together for people to catch up on the story..  So, I should really check that out.  I would REALLY like it if Bungie (or whomever these days) would remake the campaign missions Halo 1 and 2 using the Halo 3 engine.  I would love to go through them again and not have to put up with dated graphics and no achievements.  I suppose if Microsoft did that, each set of campaign missions would be $30 :/</p><p>Anyways, I thought the ending for the Halo series worked pretty well.  It put a lid on Halo..  hopefully when the do make a Halo 4, it'll be called something more appropriate.</p><div class='title'><b>More?</b></div><p>What more is there to say about Halo really?  I'm horribly at multiplayer and I really was playing it more for the story.  Though now that 2 of my close friends picked up 360s with Halo 3, I might be online a little more messing around with forge or multiplayer..  but I think I've hit my limit for regular multiplayer.  I really don't get that much enjoyment out of running around killing a bunch of people I don't really know to ascend the ranks and fight people that I can't really compete against.  Plus, there's other games to play ^_^</p><p>Halo 3 is a great social game, though.. so if you got a couple friends with a copy, getting yourself a copy isn't such a bad idea.  There's more than just Slayer matches.</p><p>I guess that's really all I have to say about Halo 3.  :shrugs</p><p><em>Related Posts</em><br/><a href="/old/v6/halo-3-biting-the-bullet" title="/halo-3-biting-the-bullet">Halo 3: Biting the bullet</a><br/><a href="/old/v6/halo-3-midnight-release" title="/halo-3-midnight-release">Halo 3 Midnight Release</a><br/><a href="/old/v6/halo-3-initial-impressions" title="/halo-3-initial-impressions">Halo 3 Initial Impressions</a><br/><a href="/old/v6/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset" title="/halo-3-xbox-360-wireless-headset">Halo 3 Wireless Headset</a><br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 14, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 10, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max Event Party</h3><p>To top the Tuesday evening off, Adobe threw an event party for all participants.  Fully catered with food and beer!  The doors opened up around 6:30 or 7:00pm.</p><p>Inside the doors, you were escorted through a tunnel of light.  On the other side, you emerged within the 80s</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0570.webp" /></p><p>You were inside of a massive hall that was sectioned into 3 separated eras of our past: the 80s, 90s and 00s.  In the air were the annoying sounds of the 80s.  In the middle of the hall, was a curtain that projected Ferris Beuler, and Back to the Future.  There were 8 flat panel screens setup playing Super Mario Brothers, Elevator Action, and several other Wii Virtual Console Titles.</p><p>Several other trinkets were placed all over the place too.  In the corner, they setup a retro arcade with Pacman, Tetris, Centipede, and Air Hockey.  You could also find a Delorion, Karaoke, Picture Booths and a couple other weird 80s things.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0555.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0558.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0560.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0572.webp" /></p><p>There were plenty of things to eat as well.  You had your choice between hot dogs and macaroni & cheese.</p><p>The flow of the room forced you to go counter-clockwise, which brought you into the 90s.  That's pretty backward, actually.  If they had you move clockwise as the decade progressed, it would've made more sense.</p><p>In the 90s, the curtain displayed Britney spears, and off to the side were BMX bikers doing a bunch of tricks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0561.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0551.webp" /></p><p>Caterers offered pizza and mini-burgers.

All the tables were full with adobe maxers betting fake cash against each other.  More flat panel TVs were setup, this time with Xbox 360s playing lanned Halo 3.  They also had a Segway obstacle course!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/100_0566.webp" /></p><p>For food, they offered mostly Asian buffet foods.</p><p>No matter which decade you were in, all the beers table offered the same variety, so, thank god, you didn't have to go searching for what you wanted.  I think it would've been different to pull off beers from the past two decades though, so maybe it was more of a limitation than a convenience.</p><p>Anyways, after grabbing a couple beers and some tasty food, I played some Halo 3 for a little while.  Unlike playing Halo online, most of the convention goers weren't die-hard fans, so I was actually able to hold my own for the majority of the time.</p><p>After a game or two, my co-workers caught up with me, so I joined in some more group oriented activities.  We played some air hockey, Super Mario, took some pictures in the photo booth, went back to Halo.  It was a great time, and the beer kept flowing ^_^</p><p>They eventually began kicking people out of the place, so the good times came to an end.

This session covers design and technical challenges inherent to making games for advertising campaigns. This discussion was lead by Sam Rivello, who is the director of Multimedia Development at NeoPets inc. He has designed over 400 flash and shockwave games developed for a youth oriented audience.</p><div class='title'><b>Casual Gaming</b></div><p>Rivello first stating what type of games are advergames. They are 100% casual games that require no long term commitment or special skills from the User. Casual games are meant for a mass audience and continue very few, and simple rules in order to play. Your game should lie within the 5-10 minute attention span of your audience.</p><p>Like all advertising, it should grab the User and keep them playing as long as possible, which means don't push details and information on the user. When a user thinks fun, they don't think about reading or something informational. Gaming is an immersive experience, so capture that.</p><div class='title'><b>Making an advergame</b></div><p>Rivello had 4 things that make an advergame an advergame.</p><p><i>Objective</i><br/>The main objective is to generate buzz and/or influence a purchase. An advergame is really an advertisement, so if you don't successful advertise your product, you have failed at making a successful advergame.</p><p><i>Target Audience</i><br/>The target audience of an advergame are teens between the ages of 12 and 17, so be sure to create your game for that audience. Teens are very active, so if your game is boring, then you're done. Capture the User and compel them to continue with your game.</p><p><i>Success Metrics</i></p><p><i>Timing</i><br/>An advergame is always timely and will always have strict deadlines that are along-side the product you're advertising. Being late with your game is unacceptable. Contrary to that, the lifespan of an advergame is incredibly short. Most of these games stay in the market between 1 and 6 months, so budget your time accordingly. Learn best practices and build an engine that you can switch out new characters and products with easily.</p><div class='title'><b>Proposal</b></div><p>Next, how do you sneak the idea of an advergame into your advertising proposal?</p><p>This was the part of the presentation where I simple nodded off.. This really didn't apply to me at all and it sounded a lot like a technical writing lecture than anything development related. Of course, designers and developers have to write, but this isn't helpful to me at the moment one bit.</p><p>I'm sure it's great information for those Flash developers that are trying to pull their animations into games, but I'm not a flash developer. I really don't care.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>and unfortunately, that's how this whole session ended for me. I was hoping to get inspired or learn some insight, but I gained neither from this presentation. I should have taken something more applicable and useful. Oh well.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 10, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 9, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max - Best Practices for Great Experiences</h3><p>This was one of the premiere sessions hosted by the experience design, XD, team at Adobe, originally formed at Macromedia.  Andrew Lin lead this session and was a co-founder of this group.  "<em>As senior lead of XD, Lin drives the experience vision of next-generation of Creative Suite, namely Photoshop and Illustrator.  Working with engineering and product management teams, he is defining the Adobe Experience Model, a content-first interface approach for Adobe's desktop applications,</em>" says the Adobe Max website.</p><p>This session was all about what worked well for the XD team, and useful tips on how to improve the workflow of your own development team.</p><div class='title'><b>Team</b></div><p>After a bit of introductions, Lin went into what makes their team work and had 4 solid concepts they always think about for their staff.</p><p><em>Emphasis on making</em><br/>One of their main goals is to create great products, so they want their staff to have that natural inhibition to create something.</p><p><em>Generalists over specialists</em><br/>Their staff must have the overall vision of what they wish to achieve and not be bogged down by the details.  In order to reach the general audience, you must think in general terms.</p><p><em>Promote Trust and Freedom</em><br/>Innovation doesn't come by following orders, or coloring in the lines.  Real innovation comes from outside the box, and learning to trust your staff by giving them the freedom to go wild on a project is key in building an amazing product.</p><p><em>Have fun</em><br/>One of the biggest parts of their community is to have fun people to work with.  Being in a warm, playful environment is key to having a productive cohesive environment.  When choosing new members of the team, a candidate's personality outweighs their talent.</p><div class='title'><b>Process</b></div><p>Now that you've met the team, Lin went on to describe how they worked together.  Communication is crucial.  Your team needs to know what's going on with the project, and need to know they can get answers from anyone.  Having an open office without secrets and open communication promotes cohesion between everything you're working on.</p><p>Having an overall process is not that important.  Following a rigid structure only promotes stress and doesn't give your staff the flexibility and freedom to do what they want.  When you are free to be absorbed in your work, you'll get the best results ^_^</p><p>But that doesn't mean everyone can just screw around.  You must be very goal-oriented and always have focus on the end goal of your project.  With everyone working within your goals, your end user's goals will easily be met.</p><p>With these three concepts in mind, Lin gave us 5 rules for promoting a great working atmosphere.</p><p>1. <em>Simplify the problem</em>.  Never be too focused on one task that you lose sight of your real goal.  Learn to generalize and shrink the scope of your problem into steps.  Make it easy. ^_^</p><p>2. <em>Trust your instincts</em>.  Real experience cannot be read or taught, it is things you've found throughout the years, and with that knowledge you've surely encountered similar problems in the past.  If you think you're onto something, go with it.</p><p>3. <em>Share everything</em>.  The more other people know about your problem, the more knowledge you bring into the situation.  Having more eyes on a problem can find that solution you've been looking for.  Also, sharing your solutions with everybody will increase their knowledge on your overall project.</p><p>4. <em>Fail fast (to succeed sooner)</em>.  Always good advice.  If you're doing something wrong, it's best to know about it as soon as possible so you can correct the problem as soon as possible.</p><p>5. <em>We are all peers before the object</em>.  No one owns the project.  You are part of a team and as part of a team it is your responsibility to contribute to the project.  It's all about team work. ^_^</p><p>Before he finished up his tips, he stressed the importance of prototyping, prototyping, prototyping.  Always have a something to show your engineers and your customers to get the most amount of feedback possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Principles</b></div><p>This is the third component of their team:  How do they design.  Lin had 4 well organized principles they always keep in mind when designing their products.</p><p><em>What's your point?</em><br/>Having a <b>clear design objective</b> when beginning your project.  Know where you are going with it and what you hope to achieve by the end of your process.  Complete your <b>main tasks first</b>, before adding on any features.  That also goes along with <b>keeping it simple</b>.  Don't add a lot of unnecessary crap to your design.  (and) <b>Focus and emphasize</b> your main goals of your design.</p><p><em>Content is King</em><br/>Your design should be emphasize on your client's needs.  <b>Content before Chrome</b>.  <b>Provide flexibility</b> for the User to achieve their own goals with the product, while still adhering to the goals of your client.  Also, <b>enable direct manipulation</b>.. let the user do what they want.</p><p><em>Create an experience, not an interface</em><br/><b>Make it personal</b> for the user to give them a unique experience that they can take with them after using your product.  You've heard the expression 'less is more', but in practice <b>'just enough is more'</b>.  Adding in some key extras can put your design into excellence.  And be sure to <b>respond to your user</b>, rather than dictate.  Don't boss the user around, but guide them to their goals.</p><p><em>Choreograph sequence and flow</em><br/><b>Design as a whole</b>.  Be consist throughout your design and be sure to leave a trail for the User to follow.  <b>Establish a hierarchy</b> to let the user know the organization of your product.</p><p>(yeah, i kinda jammed everything together into paragraphs..)</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Like all presentations at this conference, Lin was running out of time so he tried to squish everything in as fast as possible toward the end (much like this blog post).</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, his concepts were quite sound and very helpful to everyone that attended.  It was boring as hell though, as Lin's persona really didn't seem to carry in his speech.  From the pictures he showed and practices he talked about, it sounded like it'd be a blast to work there, but a lot of his talk did seem to drag on.</p><p>It may have dragged on a bit because he was preaching to the choir on most of these points.  I found it rather amazing that nearly everything he recommended other teams to do, we had already done these things in my own development team at Widen.  As he went from point to point, I was mentally checking off things in my head, "yep, we do that..  yep, we do that, too"</p><p>Having a very cohesive team promotes a great environment that you can accomplish many goals both personal, professional, and for the company as well.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 9, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 9, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max - What Makes Interfaces feel Intuitive?</h3><p>Jared Spool is one of the most knowledgable people on the subject of User Interface.  According to the adobe max website, he's been working in the field of usability and design since 1978, before the term "usability" was ever associated with computers.  In 1988, Spool founded the <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">User Interface Engineering</a>, a firm that leads the world in research, training and consulting for website and product usability.  Check 'em out at <a href="http://www.uie.com/" title="http://www.uie.com/">uie.com</a>.</p><p>Spool began his presentation with a simple example.  He presented that crowd with a simple request form for some hotel.  The form was quite standard, but two fields on this form were optional.  The company marked these with an asterisk with a comment above stating that the asterisk marked fields were optional.</p><p>However, Users that visited the site would have a very difficult time filling out this form.  Why did they have difficulty?  Because in our everyday visits to filling out forms, the asterisk implies 'mandatory', not 'optional'.  Nearly every registration or information form we fill out on the internet has this norm.  It was unintuitive to do it any other way.</p><p>Spool asks the crowd, "Who decided what an asterisk meant?  When did it become 'unintuitive' to do it differently?"  Most things in our life are done a very specific way and have been for some day, but who decided this?  This was Spool's opening statement, and the lecture to come would help to answer this.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>As a disclaimer, Spool begins setting straight a little bit of terminology.  The term 'design' is not something that can be intuitive.  Designs don't intuit anything, people do.  So calling a design "intuitive" is a shortcut.  He just wanted to get that out there, so during the rest of his lecture he could refer to the intuitiveness of a design, without causing confusion.</p><p>So, when is a design intuitive?  Well, we defintely know when a design is unintuitive.  This happens when we look at something and have no idea what to do.  Tasks take too long, and we grow increasingly frustrated with it.  We feel its the design's fault for our shortcomings.</p><div class='title'><b>The User</b></div><p>Being intuitive means beings personal.  To make a design we need to know our user.  What does the User currently know when coming into our design?  What previous experience does the User have with this kind of process?  Here's a little graph of the User's knowledge:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071002_adobe/knowledge.webp" /></p><p>The current knowledge is what the user already knows when coming into your design, and the target knowledge is what they need to know in order to fully understand your product.  In between these two points is the knowledge..  this is the leg-work you must provide your User to understand your system.  This is where the design happens.</p><div class='title'><b>Intuitive Design</b></div><p>Intuitive design is evolutionary.  Designer's first build the technology.  Over time more features are added to help the User and make things easier.  Changes in the design are made over time as well, which reduce complexity.  Throughout time as you tweak and perfect your design, it will become more and more intuitive to the User and you'll bring that target knowledge closer to the User's current knowledge.</p><p>So, when is design intuitive?  It's when one of two things are achieved.  Either (1) the current knowledge of your User is equal to the target knowledge required for your product.  In this case, the User already knows exactly what to do.  Or (2) the knowledge gap is very small.  The user can figure out the design of your product that they don't even know that they're learning.</p><div class='title'><b>Information Gathering</b></div><p>Spool gave us a couple common practices in getting to know your user better and understanding what they know.</p><p><em>Field Studies</em><br/>Surveying your Users can give you a good estimate on your audience's current knowledge.</p><p><em>Usability Studies</em><br/>Setting up focus groups and test sessions can help you identify your knowledge gap and give you good pointers on how you can reduce it early on.</p><p><em>Personas</em><br/>Identifying who your User is can put them in a familiar atmosphere when using your product.</p><p><em>Patterns</em><br/>Studying your user's patterns and current work flows will help you communicate knowledge to the user and shrink the knowledge gap.</p><div class='title'><b>Making things intuitive</b></div><p>Making things more intuitive is all about reducing the target knowledge and placing clues in your interface to steadilly increase your User's current knowledge.  One example he gave was to use error messages that actually help your user identify the problem!</p><p>Another example is the magic of wizards.  A wizard is a piece of your program that guides your user.  When done right, wizards instantly reduce the target knowledge of your product.  It supplements knowledge with technology, but never actually teaches the User.</p><p>When using a wizard, the target knowledge of the wizard must lie within the knowledge gap of your program.  Other wise, the User would be much better off without it.</p><p>Also think about reducing some of your workflow.  Figure out what is really necessary in your design and what isn't.  If you have a bunch of unneccesary features or steps, get rid of them.  Makes things as simple for the user as possible.  Make sure your program matches the user's goals.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Unfortunately, Spool began to run out of time and was hurried up towards the end but he left us with some main points he wanted us to take away.</p><p>Intuitive is personal.<br/>Intuitive happens when the knowledge gap is minimized.<br/>and just because you know how to work your program, doesn't mean the user does.</p><p>Always remember that last one.  You've built this program, you've designed and know all about it.  Everything in the program is obvious to you, so don't think that it's completely obvious to the average user.  You current knowledge of your program is far beyond the current knowledge of your user.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Out of the conference, this session belongs in my top 3 favorite moments from Adobe Max.  Not only was this session full of rich information, but Jared Spool is a hilarious guy.  It's rather interesting that his well placed humor throughout the lecture was really what engaged the audience into all the information he presented, much like well placed hints and tool tips within your program will engage your user.</p><p>You couldn't help but learn, and I felt I left this session learning quite a bit.  Definitely look for this guy at any designer or developer conference you should find yourself at.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 9, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 7, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max Day 2 Keynote by Kevin Lynch</h3><p>After the first session of day two, everyone came back to the General Session room for a the second half of Adobe's keynote to the attendees. This was more of the previous day's self serving adobe update for everyone. The first day's keynote was about what we've done with Adobe, and today was about what Adobe is doing for us.</p><div class='title'><b>Bruce Chizen speaks</b></div><p>As a huge surprise, current CEO of Adobe, Bruce Chizen, took the stage and addressed the crowd. He began to talk about how hard is to be mister big bad CEO of a large company. Yeah.. poor him and his million dollar salary. But his speech ended on a good note. The whole slogan of Adobe Max is to Connect, Discover and Inspire. He thought it was great to see so many people inspired by the works of others and to connect with each and spread the word of Adobe.</p><p>Chizen explained that even though their job was to Inspire, it is truly us.. the designers and developers that inspire Adobe to make these products in the first place. Adobe is our instrument to create, and in turn, we are their instrument to create.</p><div class='title'><b>The rest..</b></div><p>The rest of the speech talked about Servers, Services and Tools of current Adobe. The only service that was truly amazing was Scene 7. This is a Image Server that converts images in realtime. You host an image on this server, and you can send it any number of parameters that will change the image on the fly. Extremely helpful for generating previews and being able to zoom in on online photos.</p><p>The other interesting thing in the rest of the speech was a new tool called <b>Thermo</b>. Thermo is a new Adobe program that will generate a running Flex application from importing a Photoshop document.</p><p>In this day and age, nearly all websites are mocked up in Photoshop. Once the design is done, you begin coding this thing in HTML and CSS to make it move and work the way you'd like. Thermo cuts out this step by creating the page for you. Simply import that Photoshop document and the page is creating. Of course, you'll need to do a little bit of editing to make things work.</p><p>Textbox? If you've mocked up a text box on your page, right click your input box and sample text and click on 'convert to textbox'. BAM, you've got a textbox that's completely operational and retains the text information from the sample text.</p><p>Next up was a List View complete with scroll bar and sample data. He had one of these all mocked up on his page, but with a simple right click with the sample images selected.. BAM, you've got a list of objects. You can adjust the margins of these images, and use a time-line to create roll over effects. Pretty snazzy! All using the UI.</p><p>Next up was the scroll bar. He had one of those mocked up underneath these images. With more right clicking on those components, BAM.. you've got a scroll bar. You have to specify which object is the scroll bar, the arrows, and the container though. But wait.. how does the scroll bar know which data it's looking at? Simply move a little handle over to the list and BAM. The scrollbar now works with the list!</p><p>In 20 minutes, you've already mocked up all the basic functionality of the website with actual Flex code behind it. You can easily deploy this thing for client, no problem..</p><p>Well, i'm sure you've already seen the problem with this.. The code generated by this program has got to be the most god awful, unmaintainable code in existence. Do you remember when Dreamweaver first came out? All the CSS was inline and it did not tear down any tags it created. A coder would shoot himself before ever trying to make a change on that pile of shit.</p><p>Way to go Thermo! Let's usher in a new age of horrible web code that will create more problems than it solves.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>That was about all I got out of that session. Scene 7 is bad ass, Thermo is ass bad. Of course, all the designers shit their pants when they did anything with Thermo. The gasps in the audience were really disheartening..</p><p>It reminds me of a quote said by Ted Neward of Java fame.. "You should always under stand one level of abstraction below of where you are working" Meaning, if you design a webpage, you better be damn sure you know HTML and CSS. If you develop JavaScript, you better be damn sure you know about DOM objects and Browser differences. If you don't know the abstract you're building on top of, then you have no right to develop on it.</p><p>So, if you're using Thermo and you don't know Flex.. don't even touch the thing. Learn Flex concepts and some syntax, and then begin developing your UI in Thermo. You'll probably see just how horrible a program it is and thank yourself in the end.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 7, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 7, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max - Take the Web to the next Dimension</h3><p>Carlos Ulloa is seasoned developer. He grew to be a lead developer at Psygnosis during the mid-90s before they were completely absorbed by Sony in 1999. Carlos went on to do Flash development with several advertising companies until he eventually started his own company built on Flash that came off the ground with Papervision 3d.</p><p>Carlos and his pals are responsible for creating this wonderful open source Flash library which makes 3d development in Flash quite understandable and easy for those familar with using 3d tools such as Maya and 3ds max, and easy for those that know Flash too.</p><p>Let me say.. I accomplished another one of my life goals that day when I shook the hand of a man responsible for Wipeout XL and Wipeout 3. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Realtime v. Pre-rendered</b></div><p>Interaction is the base of an engaging experience. These are the moments that make a User's experience unique. You engage a medium and that results in a reward. In other terms, interaction will result in content. To make an engaging experience you must use input to render an output in realtime. That's where we're at today.</p><p>A Realtime experience is active, responsive, flexible, customizable, and different every time. It's exciting compared to the previous step in motion graphics: Prerendered movies or pictures. A prerendered experience is passive, unresponsive, rigid, static, and repetitive. Overall, it's boring. You want to make something unique, and video games has really been at the cutting edge of making a unique experience.</p><p>Video Games lead computing innovation both in Hardware and Software. As video games began to mature we saw the advent of Full Motion video. CD-Roms were developed to hold this full-motion video as floppy disks simply could not contain that amount of data.</p><p>Realtime 3d was next. The Playstation revolutionized gaming designing their hardware specifically for rendering 3d imagery on the fly. Once 3d took the gaming world by storm, Prerendered movies were a thing of the past. "Skip Intro" began a coined phrase in most games.</p><p>Throughout the past 12 years of the Playstation, we're finally getting to the point where prerendered backgrounds ARE a thing of the past. Realtime rendered 3d can look just as good as any prerendered intro sequence, so most games don't even do them anymore. These two paths of motion graphics are finally converging to a single point.</p><div class='title'><b>The Web</b></div><p>Interactivity of the Internet is lead by Flash development. Flash player 9 in the standard of internet gaming with new features such as ActionScript 3, multi-threading, optimized rendering, and full screen modes that don't degrade your flash file. Flash has a very healthy open source community that is by flash developers, for flash developers.</p><p>That's like another 'duh' statement, isn't it? What he means by a flash open source community by devs for devs, is that most Flash open source projects are entirely independent. Many other open source community for other programming languages can be heavily commercialized with their funding provided by certain companies pushing their open source product.</p><p>At this point he unveiled his own open source project, Papervision 3d. Papervision 3d is an open source realtime 3d engine for Flash. It supports ActionScript versions 2 and 3. It is extremely powerful in terms of performance, flexibility, and expandability. It's very easy to use since ActionScript 3 has made many strides in ease as well. It has built-in Asset management. (and) Papervision also uses COLLADA which will allow you to import your models and textures from Maya, 3ds Max and other 3d programs.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Practices</b></div><p>Carlos went on to describe how development is changing with the current trends of motion graphics. The old model of software development is very time-line.. this is where you start off Designing everything. During the design phase you begin production. Production would be.. i dunno. I don't quite remember. Once you're done designing, then you begin developing, and once you're done developing that when the artists come in and make up the prerender video to fill in the gaps between levels.</p><p>This process doesn't seem very efficient at all.. It doesn't really make much sense to me either :/.. Next up he unveiled how the trends will shape this software development model.</p><p>Designing and developing will start from the very beginning. Production will still take part in the middle, however development will last throughout the whole time-line. Once Design ends, the artists will take control and work with the developers up through the end.</p><p>His whole point from these development models is that artists are becoming essential to the development of your game. You need artists creating models and levels, while your development team is working on the engine and physics. Both need to flow together to make an cohesive experience.</p><div class='title'><b>Budgeting</b></div><p>He continued on to discuss how budgeting for games have been to see a renaissance. Last generation, Art would find itself taking up 50% of the budget, with 30% for design and 20% for development. With 3d development, you needed people creating all the 3d models in the game, the levels, and making up for lack of technology like lighting effects. Artists had their work cut out for them to make 3d look believable..</p><p>These days, development is on the rise again. We have the technology to build renderable engines to make shadows and lighting effects look very believable without clever texturing tricks. Development, Design, and Art will grow to have an equal slice of the budget pie.</p><div class='title'><b>Use of 3d</b></div><p>Next, Carlos went on to describe the 4 most common uses of 3d in any medium.</p><p><i>Transitions</i> are moving from one 2d space to another through 3d.<br/><i>Navigation</i> is moving around a 3d space until arriving at a 2d space.<br/><i>Exploration</i> is moving around in 3d.<br/><i>Customization</i> is changing textures on 3d objects.</p><div class='title'><b>What's next for Papervision?</b></div><p>For the next version of papervision there are trying to include Full environments and skeletons. Full environments would include composition and camera work, compared to using the one-camera-centric stage that Flash begins with. With skeletons, they're looking at including Inverse Kinematics or Motion Capture for movement of human models. Also ASCOLLADA to import skeletons and animations from Maya and 3ds Max.</p><div class='title'><b>Inspiration</b></div><p>To conclude, he discussed where he gets his inspiration from. Games can inspire you into making a game, menu, or UI. Demos can inspire you into Special Effects. Motion Graphics can inspire composition and camera work. (and) Film and TV can inspire classic film making concepts. All these concepts are vital to creating 3d, so don't be adverse to sampling everything out there.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>I thought this was a great presentation, but it really wasn't in my field of work. Papervision is a very powerful tool and hopefully more Flash developers will begin to adopt it so we can see more amazing things in the future ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 7, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 7, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Journeyman, new on NBC</h3><p>Headed back from the conference on Monday Night, I sat next to a fellow on the bus that was an avid Heroes fan. In fact, I had completely forgot that Heroes was on that night being immersed in all things Adobe. After we shared opinions on the show, he asked how I liked the show that trailed afterward, <b>Journeyman</b>.</p><p>I had completely written off this show. I wasn't interested at all, but what did peek my interest when he described it as "Quantum Leap done right".. Now that's a bold statement. Quantum Leap is one of those classic Sci Fi shows that everyone can enjoy, so adding a derogatory statement to push your show... well, that's something a fan would take issue with.</p><p>Anyways, since it trails Heroes and this guy seemed to think it was pretty bad ass, I thought I'd give it a chance. So, as I caught up with Heroes today, I decided to catch myself up with Journeyman as well.</p><div class='title'><b>What is it?</b></div><p>Journeyman follows Dan Vassar, a San Franciscan journalistic with a decent life, a great wife Katie, a son Nate. He also has a brother, Jack Vassar, who's a police detective. Part of Dan's past is revealed right away.. apparently his ex-fiance, Livia, had died in a plane crash 9 years ago.</p><p>Dan finds himself flipping back and forth through time without reason. One day, he's taking a cab ride and suddenly finds himself back in time 20 years. He flips back and forth a couple times with a common thread between each jump.. a man named Neil Stratos (or something like that). One a jump is complete, he's brought back to his current time a day or two after his disappearance.</p><p>These jumps are not explained what-so-ever. One second he's walking along the street and Dan's head begins to pound. The headache triggers something that shoots him back in time and there you have it.</p><p>So far each episode has centered on a single person that Dan did not know prior and that he must help for the good of humanity. Sounds like the exact plot of Quantum Leap, eh?</p><p>Throughout these time jumps, he runs into little pieces of his past. He accidentally meets the past version of this ex-fiance a couple times, but then he runs into the present version of Livia. It seems that Livia is also a time-traveler.. she doesn't know what's going on either, but she has some tips for Dan. She is kinda Scott Bakula's Dean Stockwell for the moment.</p><div class='title'><b>Modern Quantum Leap</b></div><p>It certainly has the concept of Quantum Leap down, but much has changed. This time-traveling craziness really screws up his marriage, his job. This isn't Science trying to fix the past for the good of humanity, this is a typical normal guy that finds himself mixed up in this time travel business. He has just as many questions as the viewer does.</p><p>It has a very dramatized modern feel to it compared to the kooky Sci Fi bender of the early 90s. But the rules are a bit different. As stated above, he's accidentally flying through time, so he has to pick up a couple time-traveling survival tips.. like using a cellular phone from the mid-90s, not using our current US currency (like those new $20 bills), and so forth.</p><p>Also, unlike Quantum Leap, Dan does not switch places with a patron of the past. He disappears from one time and appears in the other. Compensation of matter is not even discussed in the show, but it's only been two episodes. The big mystery at the moment is both why is and how does Dan travel through time.</p><div class='title'><b>Faulty</b></div><p>This show would be fine except it's not really that great. Journeyman is a drama, before it's a sci fi show. I'm sure that follows from its creator Kevin Falls, known for the West Wing. Since it's a drama, it takes itself very seriously and provides very subtle humor, rather than more blatant stuff like in Heroes.</p><p>Journeyman doesn't compensate for this at all.. The writers try to make things interesting by making his wife, his brother, and his boss all pissed off at him for disappearing. Well sure, I'd be pissed off if my husband disappeared for 2 days without warning, but it doesn't make for good TV.</p><p>Dan really isn't all that funny either. You'd think the stuff would try to take the light-side of accidental time travel and what not, but NO.. Dan is a very stern stoic fellow that will do what needs to be done. Not that interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Worth watching?</b></div><p>I dunno.. After watching the first two episodes, I thought the show was somewhat interesting, but if they want to stay on the air, they will need to move the plotline of the show very quickly or else people will just stop watching. Overall, I'm not itching to see episode 3, but I will. I'll continue to invest my time in the show, but I don't see it paying off.</p><p>Who knows though.. surprises are good ^_^ Maybe he'll go back in time to stop his show from being canceled.</p><p>This is not Quantum Leap done right, Quantum Leap is Quantum Leap done right.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 7, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 5, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max Day One</h3><p>Earlier this week, my company and I went down to Chicago to attend Adobe Max, adobe's premiere conference discussing all things Adobe.  I've been to plenty of conventions before, but this would be my second work-related one.</p><p>This conference was huge.  Attended by 4300 people, across 60 or 70 sessions 4 or 5 times a day.  They packed so much information into this 3 day event, there's no way even a couple people could experience it all.  On the third my brain was so fired from constantly spinning and collecting information, I really needed a day to collect my thoughts and get everything down on 'paper'.</p><p>It was a fantastic time, though.  We stayed at the Chicago Hilton at night.  In the morning, they rented out big busses to shuttle people back and forth between their hotel and the convention center that held Max.</p><p>Breakfast was the first event of the day and was massively attended.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0527.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0529.webp" /></p><p>One thing Adobe did expertly well was provide a very vegetarian based meal.

A company that is world-renowned for developing interactive advertising campaigns, rich internet applications and user interfaces.  So world-renowned, in fact, that they don't even have a wikipedia article....</p><p>This talk was lead by co-founders Ivan Todorov and Ken Martin as they discussed the trials and tribulations of developing the Creativity Conducted interactive WiiMote display at the Adobe Max party on Tuesday Night.</p><p>Going into this session, I really had no idea what they were going to talk about.  The title had the word WiiMote in it, so that shot my interest all the way up, but the description didn't say what they were using them for, or how they were using them, or what the hell was going on.  I thought that they may have been using these things with Flash or something..</p><p>What it was: BLITZ had built this massive 16 foot by 9 foot widescreen display that you can paint the timeline of Adobe onto using a WiiMote, and this session was discussing how they went about doing that.</p><div class='title'><b>Concept</b></div><p>Adobe approaches BLITZ and asks them to develop a big ass display for their Adobe Max Event.  The theme of the event is 3 decades of Adobe, so incorporate that in your product.</p><p>Ken Martin took the stage and discussed how they came up with the concept.  Adobe reaches out to everyone..  Nearly everyone on the planet has used an Adobe product in their life, and maybe not even realizing it..  I mean, if you've seen a YouTube video, you've used an Adobe product as YouTube videos use the Flash player.  Big to small, everyone has been touched by Adobe.</p><p>But how do you incorporate the creativity used with Adobe into a Chronology sequence.  Typically, the word Chronological implies "bored off your ass".  Time-lines are very static and full of information..  How can we make this fun?</p><p><em>Interaction</em><br/>Well, letting the User interact with the time-line is a good start.  Adding dynamic components to a very static concept is always a step in the right direction.</p><p><em>Paintbrushes</em><br/>Let the User paint their own time-line of events.  As the time-line becomes full of life, events in Adobe's lifetime will begin to tell their own story and begin to grow with the User's composition.</p><p><em>Save and Share</em><br/>Part of making a beautiful art piece is showing it off to the world.  Being able to save this image was a key feature to this project that needed to be included from the start.</p><div class='title'><b>Finding technology</b></div><p>So we want interaction..  Interaction how?  Everyone can use a mouse, but that's boring to do for a massive display.  Trackballs are great for a display as well, but how can someone paint with a track ball?  Being able to gesture the paint strokes would be great but we'd need a tool..</p><p>Why not the WiiMote?  With a swoosh of your hand, you'll be able to paint onto the screen, like you were conducting a symphony.  WiiMote are easy to find as well, we could add in a multiplayer component to this composition to make it very interactive and physical.</p><p>Now that we've got our input device, how are we going to make the thing?  Martin explained that they wanted to build this thing with 100% Adobe driven development.  The application will be made in Flash 9, using some open source Flash products.</p><p><a href="http://wiiflash.org/" title="http://wiiflash.org/">Wii Flash</a>: To interpret the bluetooth signals from the WiiMote.<br/><a href="http://www.papervision3d.org/" title="http://www.papervision3d.org/">Papervision 3D</a> For developing 3D graphics with flash.<br/><a href="http://bytearray.org/" title="http://bytearray.org/">Export to JPG</a>: To export the final composition to JPG.</p><p>Now:  How are we going to display this thing?  They wanted something big!  Something and in widescreen format.  Hell, why not 16 feet by 9 feet?  That's pretty easy to measure.  They ended up making the display with a DIY projector, a mesh fabric background, and a dimly lit room.</p><div class='title'><b>User Experience</b></div><p>This display is all about the User.  What are our goals when developing this User's experience and how do we want them to interact with the display?</p><p><em>Intuitive and Simple</em><br/>They want something very simple the User could pick up and play right away.  This meant simple instructions, and a very easy interact that didn't take much for the User to feel at home and ready to create.</p><p><em>Animated Brushes</em><br/>Let their design bloom.  When a User makes a stroke, the painting should bloom and come alive..  kind of like when you use very course paper, the strokes bleed into the page and it feels alive.</p><p><em>Illustrators</em><br/>To create these animated brushes, BLITZ hired 5 illustrators to design 5 different styles independently from each other from the 3 decades of adobe (the 80s, 90s, and 00s).</p><p>Since BLITZ would have 5 independent illustrations, they needed to design a plug-and-play importing system for their application to add and swap these brushes at will.</p><div class='title'><b>Design Flash for WiiMotes</b></div><p>With all the concepts covered for the project, Martin handed the mic over to Todorov to talk about Implementation.</p><p>The primary challenge with using the WiiMote is that the values it emits are mostly relative to it's position.  It knows the pitch, acceleration, and points relative to the IR sensor bar..  BUT the WiiMote does not know it's exact position on the screen.  Your application must interpret that data and figure out where's it's pointing.</p><p>Besides screen location, they also wanted to utilize distance to and from the screen to draw depth into the image.  On screen, that's where using Papervision was key.  Papervision is wonderful for 3D developers because their models can be directly imported from 3ds max or Maya.</p><p>Another challenge that cropped up with how to actually paint?  The WiiMote knew what buttons were being pressed, but how would they tell Flash about the depresses?  They used a Virtual Mouse program to reprogram their computer to use the WiiMote buttons as mouse clicks.</p><p><em>Pleasant Expectations</em><br/>Some things did go precisely as planned.  Adding a second WiiMote into the mix was dirt simple.  Using open source technologies through bytearray.org were great.  Papervision is fricken awesome.</p><p><em>Pleasant Surprises</em><br/>Throughout the course of development, they were surprised a few things.  Flash Player 9 is damn fast..  They were able to push and push the new flash player with very minimal lag.  Also, the WiiFlash community is very healthy.  Any problems that came up with WiiFlash were easily resolved with the help of the community.  And they even gave back by finding some bugs too.</p><p><em>Unpleasant Surprises</em><br/>With any project, you'll come across things that are a pain in the ass.  Limitations with the WiiMote were very annoying, as they can't interpret depth as well as they'd like.  You have a limited range you can use a WiiMote, and when you break that distance, it'll think you're pointing off screen.  Also, all their vector imagery had to be converted into rasterized images when outputting on screen.</p><div class='title'><b>Display</b></div><p>Once Todorov was done talking about Flash, Martin came back on stage to talk about creating the display they were going to use for this thing.  They needed a really fricken bright lens in their projector for a 16 foot by 9 foot display, so they went through several different bulbs before finding something bright enough.  The lens had 10,000 Lumens, for those that know whatever that means.</p><p>Google Sketch-up was incredibly helpful for placing everything into space.  It was good to see of sketch of how far the user will be from the screen relative to the size of the screen, and the placement of the IR sensor bar, and all that.</p><p>And he went through other boring construction type stuff that I didn't take notes on.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>This session was pretty fun.  It was neat the see the creation of a very non-conventional piece of interactivity using state-of-the-art and very current technologies.  Always think outside the box ^_^.</p><p>Was it practical for me?  Not really.. I suck at flash.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 5, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 5, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max - Effective Website Redesign</h3><p>Neil Straghalis is one of the major players for the web team at Adobe.com. He has lead Seve website redesigns in the past years, and in this session he discusses what he has found to be the best techniques and design practices when redesigning a major website.</p><div class='title'><b>Strategy</b></div><p>He first asks.. Why? Why redesign your website? I mean, if something isn't broken, doen't fix it, right? Times change.. styles change, focus changes.. everything changes, and you must keep current. If you have a stale design, people will notice right away as being outdated, old.. You want to be on the cutting edge. Live in next year... not this year, and definitely not last year.</p><p>When you redesign your site, think about your goals. First off, have a goal in the first place.. You want to redesign your site because ______. Once you have your goal, make sure your entire team knows this goal. This is why we're redesigning the site, so keep this in mind with everything you do. Divide this goal into sub goals.. What are you business goals? What are your client's goals? What are your design goals?</p><p>Being goal oriented will make it easy to figure out where you are in the design process and if you correct in making your decisions. Basic software engineering stuff.. Have you list of requirements and adhere to it absolutely.</p><p>Another bit of strategy is Data or Content. Now that you have your goals, what content do you really need and what can you ditch. Do you really need a detailed account of Adobe's History on the front page of Adobe.com? Do you really need it on the site at all? If so, where should it go so it's not in the way of pushing your product line?</p><div class='title'><b>Redesign v. Reskin</b></div><p>When redesigning your site.. do you really need to completely overall the entire thing? Maybe a fresh coat of paint will accomplish your goals.</p><p>Skinning is an easy way to design what you already have in a different way. If the company changes focus from a family friendly environment to something with a more business oriented approach, switching out the graphics and redoing the CSS would probably be the best result, if they didn't want the content to change at all.</p><p>If skinning just won't do, then you should keep a few things in mind.. First off, What are you redesigning? What doesn't work with the site?.. What does work with the site? Also, define the scope of your redesign. Are you completely redoing all the pages of the entire site, or just the front couple of pages? Back to content and data.. what do you need? what don't you need?</p><p>Another thing you may not think about is Priority. What do you want the User to see on your site? What isn't so important on your site that you shouldn't spend too much time on?</p><p>Remember that the overall goal of a redesign is to make your site as good or better than the previous version, so if something simply isn't working, maybe you should rethink your decision and revisit your previous version.</p><div class='title'><b>Design</b></div><p>Once you've developed your goals, and begun to form an idea of your redesign.. Design it! Start drawing mock-ups and coding prototypes. As you start building your website keep a few things in mind...</p><p><i>Build with a redesign in mind</i><br/>You're already begun to build your website, but experience tells us that everything can and will change. You will be redesigning what you're working on now, so build this new design with that in mind. Don't make things difficult for you in the future.</p><p><i>Generic Naming</i><br/>Part of that is naming things generic. You want to clearly label your CSS classes and ID tags so you have a general idea of what they do, and then reuse them all over your site. Don't be too specific or you'll get bogged down with thousands of IDs that you just cannot maintain.</p><p><i>Semantic Markup</i><br/>Speaking of CSS, Use it! Use it alot. This is rather obvious. CSS is there to make designing, skinning and the web experience as editable and customizable as possible. If you aren't using CSS, then you have fallen way behind of the times.</p><p><i>Separate Presentation from Content</i><br/>Build templates, and reuse CSS and JavaScript. Don't put too many details into each of your pages when you have an entire sites to build. Templates are a great way of reusing code throughout the site. When making a single change to your site, you don't want to make that change in a thousand places.</p><div class='title'><b>Design and Develop</b></div><p>Now we've gotten to the fun part ^_^. Bringing your design to life with all you have. Again.. be sure to use CSS, Templates, and Shared Assets. Shared Assets meaning.. use the same images, javascript files throughout the site rather than making them page specific. Reduce and Reuse!</p><p>Other methods of re-development can be Scripting, Find and Replace, Hand Coding, Application code updates, and XML... duh, right? The whole concept of a redesign is to generalize everything, but sometimes you do need a little bit of Hand Coding on a single page..</p><div class='title'><b>Adobe Developer Connection</b></div><p>At this point, Straghalis went through the steps his team took with Adobe.com and merging the Macromedia together. Currently his team is working on redesigning the current Adobe.com into something very customizable and personal to the User.</p><div class='title'><b>Summary</b></div><p>So.. to summarize, ask yourself Why redesign? When you know why you're redesigning, ask yourself What are you redesigning? When you know the scope, start doing something prototypes, and ALWAYS build with a redesign in mind.</p><p>Then once you're done, it's time for vacation!</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Overall, I thought this was a great presentation full of rich practical information that really does work. Most of this stuff is rather obvious, but sometimes you just need to be reminded of it in a very organized way. ^_^ Great stuff.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 5, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 5, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max - Online Ads that Attract</h3><p>With the Internet becoming the number one medium for information and entertainment, Ads agency need to continue to push the envelope building Advertisements that are interesting, playful, and will get more User to buy their product or come to their website..  accomplish their goals in general.</p><p>This session seemed like it was going to be about how to make Online Ads really attract to Users, but it turned into a showcase of Eric Natzke's work.  Eric Natzke is an artist whose experience with Flash have been self-taught.  But throughout his career as a Flash developer and designer he continues to push the envelope of current trends and best practices when making his Flash movies.</p><p>Natzke's passion for art and animation and his goals have been facilitated by seeking out advertising jobs and taking each task as a completely new challenge.  "Ok, I've done ads for these guys before..  how can I do them better?" He would ask himself with each job that came his way.</p><p>This session was really self serving, so i didn't really get a whole lot out of it.  Especially since I suck at Flash.  I dunno, maybe it's easier these days, but the little I've played around with it and done tutorials simple result in ass, or work except for some bug I cannot solve.</p><p>Anywho, check out Natzke at <a href="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/" title="http://jot.eriknatzke.com/">http://jot.eriknatzke.com/</a> and most of his work can be found at <a href="http://play.natzke.com/" title="http://play.natzke.com/">http://play.natzke.com/</a>.

The session was all about getting started using AIR and writing an AIR application using simple HTML and JavaScript.</p><p>This session was lead by Jeff Tapper, a web consultant with clients including Harley Davidson, Toys R Us, IBM, Dow Jones, American Express, and so forth.  He is an Adobe certified instructor teaching about Flex, ColdFusion, and Flash.  He's also written and edited a few books too, including <em>Flex 2: Training from the Source</em> and <em>OO Programming with ActionScript 2.0</em>.  This guy has quite a bit of credentials, but he apologized that this session really didn't do anything with Flex.</p><p>Since this was a Hands On session, the room was full of PCs ready for messin' with.  Tapper lead us through 5 examples he had setup and ready to go.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0542.webp" /></p><p>Even though this was the first session I had attended at MAX, the focus of this whole conference was very clear: AIR.  AIR is an acronym for Adobe's Integrated Runtime environment.  It's their desktop VM you can run Adobe's web based programming languages against.  It's rather revolutionary really.. being able to develop and deploy desktop applications with your knowledge of web development is quite an idea.</p><p>I was quite excited to dive into this stuff since it had been crammed down my throat all morning.  I mean, how do you do this stuff?</p><p>All the computers were setup with <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a>, an Eclipse based IDE specifically developed for AIR development, which is free for download on <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana's Website</a>.  You just create a new project, type out some HTML and some Javascript and BAM.. you've got an AIR app.</p><p>The five examples he brought us through were <b>Copy and Paste</b>, <b>Drag and Drop</b>, <b>Network Connectability</b>, and two others I don't really remember.  This was all done in JavaScript calling methods from the AIR API.  Pretty slick stuff.</p><p>Again, check out <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" title="http://www.aptana.com/">Aptana</a> and play around with it for yourself. ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 5, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 5, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Adobe Max Day 1 Keynote by Kevin Lynch</h3><p>After breakfast on the first morning of Adobe Max, Kevin Lynch came in front of the 4300 participants and talked about all things Adobe.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/071001_adobe/100_0541.webp" /></p><p>This is one of the most self centered, self promoting keynote speeches I've ever listened to..  In fact, it really wasn't a keynote at all..  It was an hour and a half long commercial about Adobe, about MAX, and about what you can do with Adobe.  Kevin Lynch traded off with several other developers and designers who would give a run down of what was new with their product or how Adobe was the perfect solution for them.</p><p>There was one piece of technology that was very exciting out of all this.  That was that flash now supports the H.264 HD video format.  So, now you can publish video in flash up to 1080p and it will work seemlessly across multiple platforms that support the H.264 format, like Flash Player 9 on the web, mobile phones, TVs, and the Playstation 3.</p><p>One of the presenters Lynch brought up on a stage did have some useful information we all could use.  He discussed 5 ways to give you User a great experience with your product.</p><div class='title'><b>Content is King</b></div><p>Websites should not prevent the User from getting at what they want.  They are at the website to view content..  Your design must be subtle and helpful for the User to achieve their goals as effortlessly as possible.</p><div class='title'><b>Make it Personal</b></div><p>Adding that personal touch for the User will make them feel more at home and provide an atmosphere that is efficient for them.  This involves skinning and customability of design and workflow for your website.</p><div class='title'><b>Less is (still) more</b></div><p>This goes back to the idea of being subtle.  Your design should not get in the way of the User and should accent the User's experience, not inhibit.</p><div class='title'><b>Movement has meaning</b></div><p>Add movement and animation to transitions between navigation.  What the User feel like they are actually moving through the UI rather than just one page to the next.  This gives a sense of depth into the content and provides the User with information of what they've done to reach their current destination.</p><div class='title'><b>Create an Experience, not a UI.</b></div><p>Pulling all these concepts together will give the User a unique experience that will stay with them and will keep them coming back and bringing other Users to your site.  The Internet is the most interactive medium the average person has at their finger tips, so WOW them.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 5, 2007<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">October 2007</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/adobe-max-day-one">5</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/adobe-max-day-two-general-session-keynote-by-kevin-lynch">7</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/adobe-max-day-two-best-practices-for-great-web-experiences">9</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/adobe-max-day-two-adobe-max-event-party">10</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/halo-3">14</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/xbox-360-sneak-king">15</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/sneak-king-final-thoughts">16</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/psp-gurumin-impressions">17</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/beautiful-katamari-impressions">23</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts">24</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/freaks-and-geeks">27</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/freaks-and-geeks-further-thoughts">28</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/heroes-speculation">30</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/phantasmagoria">31</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
