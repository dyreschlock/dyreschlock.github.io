It feels rather weird though..  this whole Season kinda felt like not much has happened (up until the last 4 episodes), but the show has come a long way since last year.  We know many of the Others, have seen all the Dharma stations, and know what happened to the Dharma Initiative.  We also know who's been getting busy with each other on the Island, and Locke has become a badass again.</p><p>And what the hell is up with Mikhail..  he gets the shit kicked out of him every single episode he's on, and has even died twice, but still comes out okay the next episode.  I think the writers took a page out of South Park for this guy.  Maybe the name Mikhail is the Russian equivalent of Kenny.</p><p>Anywho, Now that all of my TV shows have completed until Fall, it's time to go outside and frolic in the bask of Summer.  Or (something i'll probably do) watch all the episodes of Lost again from the very beginning by showing them to new people.</p><div class='title'><b>In the News</b></div><p>As stated yesterday, only 3 seasons remain with 16 episodes each.  The next episode of Lost will air in February of 2008, though.  The tiny 4 month Season 4 should end around this time next year.  So the timeline of episodes is probably something like this:</p><p>Season 4: Feb 2008 - May 2008<br/>Season 5: Feb 2009 - May 2009<br/>Season 6: Feb 2010 - May 2010</p><p>Also: I will buy <a href="http://abctvstore.seenon.com/detail.php?p=18265&v=lost" title="http://abctvstore.seenon.com/detail.php?p=18265&v=lost">these</a> once they have all eight stations included.

Lost End</h3><p>Last night, was the ending of Heroes Vol. 1 and I'm not really sure how i feel about the ending.</p><p>One can't simply watch Heroes and not compare it to Lost, being it the other prime time networked Sci-Fi show.  Lost does a lot of things that really keep me watching, but others constantly complain about.  Lost is all about compounding mystery and never really giving the audience any specific closure.  The writers allow the audience to build up theories and speculate about the show's direction, so the mystery will always be there.  Specifically with the way they end a Season.  Each season constantly builds up to a massive climax where the audience isn't given enough information to solve a mystery, but ends in such a way where the first 4 or 5 episodes of the next season undoubtedly will.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b><br/>For example, at the end of Season 1, no mystery was really solved, but there was closure on the current events.  Sayid and Charlie dispelled the Other's incoming attack, while Jack, Locke, Kate, and Hurley blew open the Hatch and while Sawyer, Jin and Michael were blown into the Ocean.  The biggest mystery of Season 1 became the main focus of Season 2: The Hatch.  The first 3 or 4 episodes finally gave the audience what they wanted throughout Season 1 and the rest of the Season compounded the mystery.</em></p><p><em>The same happened with the end of Season 2.  Well, i suppose one very large mystery was solved at that time: "What would happen if the counter went past 0?"  Also, we learned why/how the plane crashed on the Island.  Season 2 was kinda at odds with itself, since it juggled two mysteries at once.  The ending of season 2 gave closure to Hatch, while climaxing on the Others.  I suppose another mystery solved was the identity of Henry Gale.</em></p><p><em>Anyways, the point is that the Season 2 ender setup Season 3 to give the audience what the wanted with the Others.  Even though, they spread out the answers across the entire Season.</em></p><p><em>The same will true with tomorrow night's Season 3 finale.  All current events will be resolved, and a 'larger' mystery will show itself to be the focus of Season 4.  What could it be?  I think Jacob or something involving Jacob will be the focus of Season 4, while half-way through the Season, 'The Rescue' will start showing its face and probably be the focus of Season 5, with Season 6 something to do with Dharma.</em></p><p><em>If I were to name the seasons, I would name season 1: the crash, season 2: the hatch, and season 3: the others.  perhaps season 4 will be 'the island', season 5: the rescue, and so on.</em></p><p>Anyways, the reason I bring up Lost is that the Season ender gives the audience something to look forward to.  It ends on a cliffhanger that makes the audience squirm.  Heroes did not do that last night, in my opinion.  The whole season led up to Peter and Sylar fighting and the writers gave them exactly that.  The battle to save the world and enough of the aftermath to bring the audience back down from their high.  Volume 1 is closed.</p><p>The only cliffhanger the audience was given was the first 5 minutes of Volume 2, with Hiro back in time when the eclipse happened.  That's not what i care about at the moment.  I cared about Sylar fighting Peter, and stopping the bomb..  but all that is done with now.  I can't get attached to a story element in Season 2 when i've only been given 5 minutes of it.</p><p>The ending also eluded to Sylar being alive, and I'm sure Peter is still alive as well.  If Season 2 focuses on this, it'll just be Season 1 all over again.</p><p>So, yes..  I don't really know how i feel about it, because on one hand: i was given exactly what i wanted, but on the other: now what do i look forward to.  Lost gets it in this department..  even though, so many people complain about it.</p><p>So that's how i feel about that.  I can't wait for the finale of Lost tomorrow. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>In the News</b></div><p>Lost will be a total of 6 Seasons with the remaining 3 seasons only 16 episodes each, as opposed to 24 episodes.  Each episode will air consecutively.</p><p>Heroes will be back with 24 episodes, and a companion 6 episode series entitled Origins.  Each episode of Origins will focus on a single New character that might be brought into the main show.</p><p>In an interview with the creator of Heroes, he states that he wanted to make the cast of each Season as independent from each other as possible.  Originally, he was planning on killing off almost all of the current cast, with only 2 or 3 continuing characters into Season 2.  Season 2 would feature an almost entirely new cast.  He changed his mind after the audience really responded to the current set of characters.</p><p>With these thoughts in mind, it makes sense to give that much closure to Season 1.  Then you can begin anew.</p><p>(sorry.. i don't have sources, at the moment, for these 3 tidbits)<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 22,

Something had to be done.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/unshitty_room.webp" /></p><p>huzzah.  now i can say to myself, "no matter what happens, i've got that desk situation under control.  it's taken care of.  i'm done.  complete."</p><p>It's amazing how an elevated flat surface can add so much order, harmony and cleanliness to a room.  Luckily, if i still want to use a computer like a hobo, i've got my handy laptop fixed.</p><p>The whole black and white theme could be quite attractive, but several pieces on my desk need repairment to promote it.  Some new white computer speakers would be rad, and possible a new mouse too.  I've had those computer speakers for nearly 8 years.  I guess they'll just be another computer hand-me-down for my parents.</p><p>Thanks go out to Erika and Stephen for helping me bring this desk all the way from Chicago back to Madison.  I'm not too sure if my crappy car would have been sufficient transport.</p><p>While in Chicago yesterday, we made the mandatory stop at Mitsuwa.  I had never appreciated that place as much as i do now.  It's the midwest's little piece of Japan.  The stores are squished together like in Japan, the employees are polite like in Japan (though, they speak english to us westerners :/), and everything is in Japanese (w/ plenty of subtitles).  It's really the most Japanese i've been immersed in since returning to that states.  I love walking up to a restaurant and being able to read the menu.  ã?«ã??ä¸¼, ã¶ã£ã?ã?ã?ã©ã??, é³¥ã?«ã?¬ã?ã©ã??.  ^_^</p><p>I purchased several items in bulk, and called it a day.  There were plenty of kids from Anime Central hanging out as well.  Unfortunately, ACen neglected to have a saturday only pass available for purchase, or else i may have thought of considering going for a few hours.</p><p>Shade.</p><p>Wheeewww.

When i don't have anything particular to work on, I'll log into our bug tracking software. This has a list of all bugs and cases that people are and aren't working on. I sort for unassigned cases, and then assign it to myself. This is pretty much like any bulletin board you'll find around anywhere, especially in an old medieval town, usually on the back wall of a tavern. "Search for a Dragon", "Provide safe passage across the Bog of Sorrow", "Fix order processing", "This image doesn't show up in IE".. ya know. Daily Quests.</p><p>Once i pick up my quest, it's time to journey into the wilderness. The dark forest which contains complex webs of Java code. I delve deeper into the darkness, running over what happened to the contractor when he was doing the same thing. Finding the problem, developing a strategy/solution, and going through with it. I'm sure i could come up with a clever analogy if i thought about it.</p><p>Success. The quest has been complete, back to town to report my success. As, i return to town, I sync up my code base to be completely current with events and things that have happened while i was away. I didn't get any emails about Build Errors, so it appears the town was safe while i was away. I reach the gates of the inner city, and run my JUnit test suite, just to make sure the results of my quest don't infect and harm my fair town.</p><p>Crap. It appears by slaying this particular dragon, I have violated this one test that says there are only 7 of these left in the world. Now that there are 6, it fails. Well... i'll just rewrite that test to indicate 6.</p><p>Success again. The tests are green, and i'm good to go. I reach the tavern inside the city and lay down my solution on the bar counter, committing these changes to the repository. The commit message indicates which Quest this dead dragon is for.</p><p>And I'm set to go. Another job well done, and time to look for a new quest. Occasionally I'll get handed down an official assignment from city officials, like a feature request or refactor.</p><p>Abstraction is key to developing any application.. though, sometimes it helps to keep things a little more grounded.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 9, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 8, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Use the Google</h3><p>My life revolves around Google quite a bit lately.  Whenever I open up a browser, I'm in my own little Googlized world.  My personalized homepage is complete with the current weather outside, quick submit links for ebay and wikipedia, quick links various websites, news feed from digg.com, and the Gmail gadget and Google Reader gadget.  When Firefox opens up, i've automatically checked my mail and all my RSS feeds.  It's pretty handy when you don't want extra programs running in the background.</p><p>Thanks to Google Reader, I now know that kotaku.com is FAR faster at getting video games news to the Internets than Jostiq.com, most of the time.</p><p>My personalized homepage is also pimpin' with the Japanese fox theme, even though i'm pretty sick of it now.  Google is also pretty handy on my phone, when I'm not at work or home.  My personalized homepage is just as easy to access, so i can still get my mail and my news.  Google Maps is pretty slick on my phone, too.</p><p>Speaking of which, Google Maps made some pretty slick upgrades recently.  Besides new Satellite photos, you can save your own 'maps' and easily import and export from Google Earth.   I made a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1"> quick map of points</a> that those studying abroad might be interested in knowing ahead of time.  Just a couple basic areas.  I'll probably make another map that works with my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">Games List</a> a little better than my current solution.  These maps can be saved as a KML file, which loads directly into Google Earth.</p><p>If you haven't played around with Google Earth, it's free for download.  Just go to <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="http://earth.google.com/">earth.google.com</a>.  Google Earth is a 3 dimensional atlas of the world.  You start up far above the earth, and can zoom into anywhere you'd like.  The surface of the earth is skinned with the same Satellite images from Google Maps and works similarly.  When you get closer to the ground, the details of Earth become more clear..  The satellite images are high enough quality most of the time that you can see buildings, cars, and houses quite distinctly, just like Google Maps.</p><p>However, Google Earth can do far more than that.  Google Earth also renders terrain and buildings in 3D.  You can tilt the view to get a good grasp of what the area actually looks like.  Here's the Nagasaki area:</p><p>Google Earth streams all these images and information in real time, so it takes up very little space on you computer.  Though, it does load all its' cache into memory, which doesn't make it very light weight.</p><p>Google Earth also has links to Wikipedia, Google Earth communities, and  Panoramio: a community photograph repository.  People from around the world, can upload their photos and input coordinates on where their picture was taken.  Each month, Google grabs all the new information from Panoramio and hooks it into Google Earth.</p><p>Yesterday, i finally decided to make my own Panoramio account and start uploading photos.  I went through pictures #10000 through #17000 on my camera.  Basically, the time i was in Japan and the summer before hand.</p><p>Here's my account: http://www.panoramio.com/user/449013<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 8, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 3, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Lost - Purgatory</h3><p><em>Lost Spoilers ahead</em></p><p>Last night's episode of Lost put a solid structure on one of those internet theories about the Island.  This theory states pretty much exactly what has been said in the last two episodes that "all the 'survivors' of 815 actually died in the crash and the island is Purgatory."  Naomi confirms this by saying that in the real world they found Oceanic flight 815 at the bottom of the ocean, in tact, with all passengers in tact and very dead.  Locke's father also says the same thing.</p><p>Lets examine everyone else's back story of how they got to the island.  Naomi's helicopter just crashed in the sea, Desmond was thrown overboard in a violent storm, Juliet drank some unknown substance given to her, Locke's father was smashed into a median, Danielle's research ship crashed on the island.  Perhaps they did all die, and this is the gateway to the afterlife.  Perhaps their actions on this island will determine where they spend enternity.  The island follows a similar construct to life, but with a few changes.  If you die on the island, do you go to hell or heaven?  Is the island itself Heaven, considering the others are a group of "good" people.  Since Ben is their leader, does that make him God, or Jesus?  Or is the Island hell, as Locke's father puts it, which would make Ben Satan or some devil?</p><p>I guess this explains why the others kidnap certain people.  They are separate the bad ones from the good ones..  The heaven candidates from the hell candidates.</p><p>Does this make the big bad black cloud of smoke the Reaper? Does that make the sonic fence the divide between heaven and hell?<br/>The whole thing with the babies also promotes this theory.  Life cannot be conceived on the Island, because everyone is already dead.  I guess the writers believe that Life begin at conception.  This is why Claire's baby is fine, and why all the other mothers die before the baby is born.</p><p>However, this whole "island = purgatory/afterlife" debate has a couple holes in it.  What about Michael?  If this is the afterlife, where did Ben send Michael?  To be reborn?  To heaven?  Or to wake up from purgatory back in the real world?  What about Ethan?  If he can leave the island to the real world and recruit people like Juliet, what does that make him?  An angel?</p><p>How do the numbers play into this theory?</p><p>The end of the season should be interesting.. even though this concept is very Twilight Zone-esq.  The really hasn't been a lot of build up, but it seems like the other's incoming attack on the survivor's camp with be the climax.  Along with whatever Jack knows.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 3, 2007<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">May 2007</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/lost-purgatory">3</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/use-the-google">8</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/questing-for-bugs">9</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/furniture-closure">13</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/this-day-in-shmups">14</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/this-day-in-starcraft">19</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/heroes-end-v-lost-end">22</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/lost-end">24</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/this-day-in-nintendo">26</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
