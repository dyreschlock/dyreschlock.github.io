This is written for people who have seen the film, District 9.  It contains several spoilers towards the end, so make sure to see the film first.  The information about South African history was taken from articles on Wikipedia.</i>]</p><div class='title'><b>British Colonization</b></div><p>After the British invaded in the 1800s and began colonizing South Africa, violence continued to climb between the colonials and the natives.  Racial violence had to stop.  In the 1890s, the British ruling party began to groundwork of what would become the Apartheid system.</p><p>It began with the Franchise and Ballot Act of 1892, which limited education.  The General Pass Regulations Bill of 1905 denied them their right to vote.  The South Africa Act of 1910 gave the British ruling power over all races of South Africa.  The Native Land Act of 1913 kept blacks from buying land outside of their "reserves".  The Natives in Urban Areas Bill of 1918 forced blacks into their own communities.  The Urban Areas Act of 1923 gave the white industry plenty of cheap labor.  The Native Administration Act of 1927 gave the British ruling over all South African affairs  The Native Land and Trust Act of 1936 which further strengthened the 1913 law.  (and) The Asiatic Land Tenure Bill of 1946 which kept the natives from selling their land to foreigners other than the British.</p><div class='title'><b>Apartheid</b></div><p>These laws became an institution beginning in 1948 known as Apartheid.  This system would further strengthen in the years to follow as further legislation was passed to refine and tighten these bills.  Segregation continued and was upheld by law.</p><p>The laws of Apartheid would prohibit marriage and sexual acts between race, require all citizens to carry and ID card with their race classification, demolish "run down" black neighborhoods, ban communism (of course), crafted a separate education system, and the Black Homeland Citizen Act of 1970 which removed black citizenship altogether!</p><p>In 1966, these laws were used in Cape Town, to forcibly remove the black population of 60,000 from District Six to Cape Flats, 25km away.</p><div class='title'><b>Protesting</b></div><p>As the laws became increasingly ridiculous, students from all races in Africa began protesting the ruling government.  The tipping point began on June 16, 1976 during the Soweto Uprising.  Students took to the streets and protested the forced tuition.  Police opened fire on the peaceful protest killing up to 600 and injuring 4000.  After that, student organizations were formed for the pure purpose of protesting Apartheid.  These organizations were formed all around the entire country.</p><p>Labor Unions began protesting with the students.  Churches joined the protests, too.  The black and native communities began to unite.</p><div class='title'><b>Civil War</b></div><p>South African security was the biggest political concern of the 1980s.  With increased violence and continuous offenses to the Apartheid System, President PW Botha declared a State of Emergency on July 20, 1985 in the most prominent areas of the country.  Under the Internal Security Act, people were put under house arrest and detained without trial.  On June 12, 1986 (4 days before the 10th Anniversary of the Soweto Uprising), the State of Emergency extended to the entire country.  In 1987, the State of Emergency was renewed up through 1989.  Over those 4 years, 30,000 people were detained, arrested, interrogated and many tortured.</p><p>In 1989, President Botha suffered a stroke and was forced to resign.  On February 13, 1989, he was succeeded by FW de Klerk.  De Klerk made moves to end the political stalemate and repeal the laws of Apartheid.</p><div class='title'><b>A New Threat?</b></div><p>1990 was the pivotal point in South African history that would demolish the Apartheid system.  However, things changed a little bit when a huge alien mothership set itself in the air directly above Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city.  It just appeared there and gave no indication of its plans.  After 3 months with no communication, the government flew to the craft, bore a hole through its hull, and discovered an alien race inside.  </p><p>They were extremely weak and malnourished.  The South African government began extracting the population of one million.  They gave them District 9.</p><p>With the discovery of a new life form to earth, the South Africa population united and quickly negotiated a resolution to the Apartheid system peacefully and successfully.  But enacted new laws to "handle" the alien population.  The Apartheid system was reborn and segregated aliens and humans.  These laws seemed to make sense given they were a completely separate life form.</p><p>The aliens seemed aimless and savage.  Many have speculated as to how they achieved the intelligence to constructor and operate the interstellar vessel that brought them to our planet.  The popular theory is that the population is mostly workers or soldiers without leadership or direction.  Those aliens in power either abandoned ship or are deceased.</p><div class='title'><b>Alive in Joburg</b></div><p>In 2005, Neill Blomkamp (director of District 9) created a documentary of life in Johannesburg.  It's available online on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837" title="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1185812222812358837">Google Video</a> and on <a href="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg" title="http://www.spyfilms.com/#neill_blomkamp/alive_in_joburg">SpyFilms website</a>.  The film has been released by SpyFilms.</p><p>Alive in Joburg demonstrates the living conditions of District 9.  The aliens scavenge garbage piles for food.  They eat raw meat from slaughter cows.  The stench is awful.</p><div class='title'><b>Neill Blomkamp</b></div><p>Alive in Joburg was the first work created by Neill Blomkamp, and sparked the attention of Peter Jackson.  In 2007, they teamed up to create a short film entitled Crossing the Line (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZT23V07w4Q">trailer</a>).  Impressed with Blomkamp's vision and ideals, Jackson contracted Blomkamp to direct the film version of Halo, the popular Xbox game.</p><p>Constant disagreements between Microsoft and the movie studios cast doubt on Blomkamp who had never directed a full motion picture.  Though, Peter Jackson had no doubt in his mind.  Jackson and Blomkamp talked about revisiting Alive in Joburg and expanding.  In 2007 or 2008, Jackson put the Halo film on hiatus and they began to create District 9.</p><div class='title'><b>District 9</b></div><p>Next Year will mark the 20th Anniversary of the alien arrival in Johannesburg, South Africa.  The conditions of District 9 have become out of control, and the government wlll contract private arms corporation MNU to move the alien population to a location 200km away from Johannesburg labeled District 10.</p><p>Wkus var de Merwe is appointed head of the operation to extract the aliens from District 9.  He's a very lovable Michael Scott type of person.  Wikus var de Merwe is portrayed by Sharlto Copley who has almost no movie credits to his name.  District 9 is his actorial debut.  His only previous credit of note is the writer/director of the film Spoon released in 2008.</p><p>The extraction goes awry when Wikus contracts a virus from a recovered alien artifact.</p><div class='title'><b>Filming</b></div><p>Even though District 9 adopts the documentary style of Alive in Joburg, it fills in the rest of the story with traditional film portrayal.  The documentary style is vital for providing the history and information about District 9 and the events of August 8-10, 2010.  The traditional style provides the story of Wikus and his internal struggle with the virus.</p><p>The film's main focus is Apartheid.  District 9 is drenched in Apartheid commentary but it's not delivered in a history lesson (such as this post).  In fact, it's not even mentioned once!  I find that incredibly interesting.  I didn't know any about Apartheid until I read reviews after seeing the movie.</p><p>The social commentary is pretty thick, but it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the film.  It builds tremendous sympathy for the aliens, though "white" guilt may factor, too.</p><div class='title'><b>To Be Continued...?</b></div><p>As the virus mutates and transforms Wikus into one of the aliens, he aids one of the alien pilots into recovering the fuel for the mothership.  On August 10, 2010, the pilot reboards the mothership with his shuttle pod and the mothership leaves earth.  He tells Wikus that it will take him 3 years to return to earth and promises that he will return to restore Wikus back into a human.  The remaining alien population is moved to District 10 and Wikus has completely vanished.</p><p>Will Peter Jackson and Neill Blomkamp return to Johannesburg in 2013 when the mothership is expected to return?</p><p>It seems pretty definite to me.  In 3 days, it earned $37 million in the US, making a profit of $7 million.  With an absolutely hit on their hands and an open ending with expected future events, why wouldn't they make District 10?</p><p>But it might be awhile since Neill Blomkamp has proven his cinematic prowess to the film studios, and Microsoft will probably want to get the Halo film back on track.  Will the Halo movie be put on hold again for a District 9 sequel?  Will Halo be Blomkamp's next film?  Or will they scrap both ideas for something completely new?</p><div class='title'><b>Timeline</b></div><p>I'm pretty sure this timeline is correct.  I was paying close attention to the dates in District 9 when I saw it for the second time today.  The video feed from cameras during Wikus' capture and manhunt state Aug 10 2010.  The film mentions that the mothership has been on earth for 20 years, putting the arrival date in 1990.  1990 is also the date given in Alive in Joburg.  Wikipedia backs up this information.</p><p>However, the film synopsis on most film sites say the mothership arrived 30 years ago and the Theatrical Trailer says 28 years ago.  I don't know what the believe now.  Of course, trailers aren't created by the studio, it's created by the corporation to market the thing.</p><p>They probably just got the date wrong.  And all the film sites base their synopsis from the trailer.  Though, the commentary on the eventually rental release should be interesting as to what is actually going on here.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on August 17, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">August 5, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Games I buy: Falcom Edition</h3><p>I love Madison.  It has a fairly decent population of eclectic nerds.Â  Plenty of young people thanks to UW Madison.  The school brings a decent foreign Asian population, too. Â  Plus, Madison isn't that big, so we're all able to connect in many ways.</p><p>One of these tiny ways is Half-Priced Books, a used bookstore that buys and sells books and almost all forms of media.  Visiting one of these stores and seeing what they have available is one of the best ways a community or region reveals its interests.  I've found old Squaresoft games, Kurt Vonnegut novels, Communications of ACM magazines, bizarre Anime and plenty of other stuff.</p><p>Today, I came scross something pretty unique.  It looks like some Japanese nerd decided to sell his collection of Falcom games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0078.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_0079.webp"  /></p><p>Every now and then I'll come across Japanese games in Madison used stores, but Falcom games?  Falcom games are usually only purchased by the nerdiest of hardcore J-RPG fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Nihon Falcom</b></div><p>Falcom is a pretty bizarre game company.  You may know them best as the developer of the Y's franchise, which first premiered in America on the Super Nintendo.  That's the first I had ever heard of them, until <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908" title="http://www.1up.com/do/minisite?cId=3156908">Retronauts</a> did an episode on Falcom earlier this year.  (episode 66)</p><p>They are a successful Japanese PC Game development studio that hasn't done a single Porn game.  Actually, one of their first games, Joshidaisei Private Stripper, sounds like a porn game, but that's the only one!  Their success has been built from their JRPG franchises: Dragon Slayer / Xanadu, Y's, Sorcerian, Legend of Heroes, Brandish.</p><p>Also, even though you can find many of their games on the popular console platforms, Falcom is not responsible for any of their ports except for the PSP.  They contract other development studios to do them.  It's pretty funny listening to the Retronauts crew attempt to list all the companies that have ported a Falcom game to another platform.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Gurumin</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4777.webp"  /></p><p>I've only ever played one Falcom game through to completion and that's Gurumin.  One of those games at Half-Priced Books was the original PC version of the game!</p><p>Gurumin is a cute action-RPG in which you play as Palin.  Palin is new to a quiet mining town and becomes lonely with the lack of children.  She does find a friend, but it turns out her new friend is a monster.  A good monster, though.  Their monster town has been ripped apart by other monsters and some even kidnapped.  Palin to the rescue!</p><p>It's a fantastic game with cute characters, cute dialogue, and throw-back PS1 era graphics.  It would be an amazing game if it weren't for the annoying single analog stick controls.  After spending time with Gurumin a couple years ago, I wrote a little bit about it on <a href="/old/v6/psp-gurumin-impressions" title="/psp-gurumin-impressions">October 17th, 2007</a>.  Please get past the horrible writing.</p><div class='title'><b>Purchase</b></div><p>Of the 7 Falcom games at Half-Priced Books, I picked up the 3 chapters of Legend of Heroes and Y's Origin.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4790.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090805_falcom/IMG_4789.webp"  /></p><p>After re-reading my Gurumin Impression from 2 years ago, I think I might pick up that one too.

Lost in Translation is a film starring Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson.  It's about two people who aren't very happy, and then are subjected to culture shock to make it worse.  Through their culture shock and depression they meet each other. And bring each other out of it.</p><p>I could've sworn I've seen it before, but despite taking place in Japan and starring Bill Murray, it didn't make an impression on me.  Though in October 2003, I was in a different place.  Happy and in love.  Lost in Translation's heavy tones fell on my deaf ears.</p><div class='title'><b>Isolation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/wander.webp"  /></p><p>When I find myself alone in Japan, there is always that looming sense of isolation.  I can ask questions and receive answers, but there is no one I can really engage in conversation.  All I have are my thoughts to bounce ideas off of.  I text, email or IM people back home, but the sound of my own voice becomes mute.  It becomes a treasure when I actually have another American (like myself) to talk to.  I thought Scarlett Johansson nailed that emotion perfectly when the film followed her around for a day.</p><p>Those scenes really are the perfect picture of a lone foreigner wandering about the daily lives of a population that is not their own.  For the most part, everyone just ignores the outsider.  Everyone is plugged into their lives, and have no business getting into others.  Children will sometimes break those boundaries, but that's only because they haven't been incorporated into society, yet.</p><p>Though, I've never experienced the agoraphobic culture shock to the point of incapacitation.  The only times it has taken anchor has been when I've truly been alone in Japan.  But, I just throw those emotions away.  My time in Japan has always been short and limited.  It would be a waste to be stuck in a tiny hotel room.</p><div class='title'><b>Language</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/language.webp"  /></p><p>Obviously, I identify far more with Scarlett Johansson's character's silent brooding wonderment, than Bill Murray's case.  Though when I'm in Japan, it's for absolutely no purpose than to wander around and look at things.  If I were there on business, as is Bill Murray's character, my culture shock probably wouldn't be as agoraphobic.  His culture shock is in the language and miss-communication.  I don't have much trouble in that department.</p><p>The scene where Bill Murray is waiting in the hospital talking with the granny is a conversation I've had many times in Japan. ^_^  Japanese people will always try to dumb down their language to what they think is simple for you, but is often what makes them even more difficult to understand.  I know sentence structure, noun forms, and what is being said, I just can't translate some of the words because my vocabulary is horrible.  Maybe I just need to ask, "What is this word?"</p><p>Though, a lot of the Japanese dialogue in the film is pretty easy to understand.</p><div class='title'><b>Moments</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/moment.webp"  /></p><p>Lost in Translation ends in the same manor many moments end in Japan.  A moment is that is truly final.  A moment that can only take place in a single moment of your life and one that can never be relived.  A "Goodbye" that is goodbye forever.</p><p>Charolette and Bob Harris depart under these terms and embrace with the knowledge they will never see each other again.  Because time in Japan always comes with an expiration date.  And when it expires, that is it.  The end.  And that is where the film ends.</p><div class='title'><b>Epilogue, aka Reverse Culture Shock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090803_losttranslation/reversecultureshock.webp"  /></p><p>In real life, most of these moments are final, but that is not the end of the story.  The epilogue is returning to life before Japan.  Taken away from isolation and plugged back in familiarity and understanding.  For some people this is a breath of fresh air.  People to finally talk to!  People who understand me!  For me, I cherish the isolation.</p><p>Nothing bothers me in Japan.  People keep to themselves and are polite to each other.  Store clerks say thank you and go out of their way to ensure your satisfaction.  Being a foreigner, I'm a guest in their country and they treat me as such.</p><p>Back in America, Life sucks.  Everyone is unhappy because they HAVE to work today.  A single customer asking a single request is WAY TOO GODDAMN much of a hassle.  People think too much of themselves rather than the company they represent.  They think of the company paying them for their services, rather than them earning their pay for giving their services.</p><p>Everything in life returns to the ordinary, rather than the extraordinary.  Here's what I thought when I first got back after those 3.5 months studying abroad: <a href="/old/v6/home" title="/home">December 29th, 2006</a>.</p><p>Showing this side of being in Japan would have truly ruined Lost in Translation.</p><div class='title'><b>Passion!</b></div><p>Anyways, Lost in Translation fell on deaf ears because I didn't know anything about this.  I never had these moments.  I never experienced such isolation.  I never had to talk through a language barrier.  All these points resonate beautifully in the film.  So much so that I can never watch it again.  Unless it's with my friends from the Fall 2006 Class of Nagasaki Gaigokugo Daigaku.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on August 3, 2009<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">August 2009</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/lost-in-translation">3</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/games-i-buy-falcom-edition">5</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-history-and-timeline-of-district-9">17</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
