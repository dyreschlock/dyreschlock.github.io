At this press event, Sony announced a bunch of information that I've been waiting for.  They announced the release date for <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b> and announced a bundle pack that includes Metal Gear Solid 4, an 80gb Playstation 3, and a Dual Shock 3.  All of this will hit shelves on June 12th, 2008 for a very reasonable price of $500.  For $500, I'll get the game I want, a Playstation 3 that'll play nearly all Playstation games and has decent harddrive space, and their "new" controller.  I don't even have to bother with owning a Sixaxis controller, I can skip right to the new controller.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/mgs4_ps3_bundle_box.webp" /></p><p>I'm pretty happy about this bundle.  SO happy, in fact, that I've begun taking an active look at what games I really want for the Playstation 3 and what Blu-ray movies I should by.</p><p>and thus...  rambling begins.</p><div class='title'><b>Games</b></div><p>Game-wise, there isn't a megaton of wealth out there, but there's a few things I'm interested in.  Two games that are already out are Uncharted and Stranglehold.</p><p><b>Uncharted</b> has been described as the perfect action movie come into the game scene.  The game takes a lot of cues from Die Hard, where you control a "regular" guy in extreme action situations.  I don't know all the details, but it sounds pretty fun.  Not $60 fun, of course.  I would definitely pick it up for $30, or perhaps stretch it to $35.  Used copies are floating around the $40~$45 mark.  That should go down by summer.</p><p><b>Stranglehold</b> is another "action movie" game.  Directed by John Woo and "starring" Chow Yun Fat, Stranglehold is the sequel to their first collaboration, Hard-boiled.  I've played the demo on Xbox and it is one of the most ridiculous games to come out last year.  I love it.  Not $60 love it, though.  This is another 30 spot, at best.  I wanted the PS3 collector's edition because it included the original Hard-boiled on Blu-ray, but now..  I don't really care.  I don't really care to watch Hard-boiled, and the game was developed for the Xbox.  I think I'll probably just pickup the 360 version when I find it for $20 or less.</p><p>Another game I want to pick up in <b>Gran Turismo 5 Prologue</b>, which is already out in Japan and April here in the US.  Though, paying $50 for a mere fraction of what will be Gran Turismo 5 is way too much.  It's the equivalent of a demo, really.  $50 for a demo is ridiculous, but it's really a showcase for the Playstation 3.  It shows off how good the graphics can be.  Maybe If I find a super cheap copy in Japan, I'll pick it up.  Like, $35 cheap..  :shrugs:, maybe not.</p><p>And that's it really.  There's not even anything else in development I'm terribly interesting in except for <b>Resident Evil 5</b>.  <b>Wipeout HD</b> is also kinda iffy..  that series really died for me after Designer Republic broke off from Psygnosis/Liverpool.</p><div class='title'><b>Movies</b></div><p>Something I did do immediately in celebration was purchase <b>Scanner Darkly</b> on Blu-ray for $20.  Hurrah, my first Blu-ray.  I started to take a look at what other movies I would want as well, but that momentum began to fizzle off.</p><p>Netflix is really helpful in keeping you from buying movies.  With every movie I came across, I thought to myself, "Am I really going to watch this more than once?"  I Love Scanner Darkly and would watch it a couple times over.  It's also that kind of movie that I would want to watch with people when they're around.  But other movies like that?</p><p><b>War of the Worlds</b> is another movie I was thinking of.  I would definitely love to see that in beautiful Hi-Definition, but all the other movies I came up with I already own or it wouldn't make a difference if I owned them on Blu-ray v. DVD.  Even Scanner Darkly is somewhat useless on Blu-ray because it's animated.  War of the Worlds isn't out of Blu-ray though..</p><p>There are some movies that are out on Blu-ray that caught my eye.  Like <b>Blade Runner</b>, <b>Wings of Honneamise</b>, and <b>Fifth Element</b>.  Each of these movies have been "remastered" for Blu-ray and weren't originally filmed with HD in mind.  How good could these movies really look compared to DVD.  Plus, how many times would I really watch them?  Wings of Honneamise would be spectacular except they don't even sell a stand-alone Blu-ray.  It comes with a DVD version and is $80?!</p><p>One movie I came across that could be amazing on Blu-ray is <b>Paprika</b>.  That movie was brilliantly gorgeous, but I didn't really like it.  The movie was all about the visuals and effects.  Purchasing it reminds me a lot of purchasing Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 on DVD back in the day.  I love those movies and thought it was a brilliant display of music and animation.. but now they just sit on the shelf.. taking up space.  Is that how Paprika will be in a year if I buy it?</p><p><b>Lost season 3</b> is out on Blu-ray..  but I already own the DVDs and I haven't even watched them yet!  Plus those Blu-rays are expensive..  screw that.</p><p>All-in-all, my little Blu-ray mania ended pretty quickly.  I have Scanner Darkly, will pick up War of the Worlds, and might buy Paprika.  I still have until mid-June anyways, so there's no rush on Paprika.  Also, I'll pick up <b>Cloverfield </b>on Blu-ray.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Even with owning a Playstation 3 in the future, it doesn't really seem worth it.  I'll play through Metal Gear, and then Uncharted.  But then it'll probably just sit there...  much like my PSP.  My Wii is the same way too.  I haven't touched my Wii since November.</p><p>Hopefully, owning a PS3 will revitalize my Playstation spirit and I'll finally start digging into my backlog of Playstation 2 games sitting on my shelf.  We'll see.</p><p>Also, HD isn't going to matter at all until I buy an HD TV.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on February 27, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">February 21, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Apollo Justice impressions</h3><p>Yesterday, Apollo Justice was released and is probably my most anticipated game of 2008.  Apollo Justice is the fourth game in the Phoenix Wright / Ace Attorney / Gyakuten Saiban series by Capcom and takes the series in a new direction for a couple different angles.</p><p>First off, It's the first game in the series to be specifically developed for the DS from the ground up.  All the other PW games were simply ports from the Gameboy Advance.  The first game did have a DS only chapter at the end, which is really just a taste of what the could do with the series.  In Apollo Justice, the sprites are higher resolution, more detailed, and better colored, cut-scenes are now pre-compiled, rather than using sprite manipulation, and everything else you saw in Chapter 5 of Phoenix Wright 1.</p><p>The other huge change for the series is Apollo Justice as the main character.  Apollo Justice, the game, takes place at least 7 years after the end of Phoenix Wright 3, and you begin by defending Phoenix Wright whose been accused of murder.  Through defending him you become aware of your own power as an attorney, much like Phoenix did back in the day.  You overcome people's lies through 'perceiving the truth' by a tell or nervous twitch, rather than 'unlocking it' by seeing their Psyche-Locks.</p><p>Apollo Justice as the main lead is as huge a risk for the series as it is a change and is the largest criticism about the game.  I mean, the previous were named Phoenix Wright (in the US).  He is the game.  Games like Metal Gear Solid 2 and Halo 2 suffered greatly because of this criticism when you played as Raiden or the Arbiter.</p><p>Being a huge fan of Phoenix Wright, I wasn't really bothered by this.  One of my favorite moments in past Phoenix Wright games was playing as a different character and learning about Phoenix Wright from a different angle.  I cared about the Phoenix Wright universe and cast of characters as a whole that seeing it through the eyes of someone was a refreshing change of pace and offered a slew of new jokes and memes.</p><p>After playing for 2 hours, my only complaint about playing as Apollo Justice is that he's almost too much like Phoenix Wright in the beginning.  Though truly, if Phoenix Wright or any other previous character wasn't in this first case, it would have turned me off from the concept.  Phoenix Wright is the crucial immediate tie-in back to the series as a whole and is crucial in shaping Apollo Justice, the character, in becoming the next big thing.</p><p>In Apollo Justice, what I'm most interested in are the tie-ins back to the series as a whole and the future of the series.  When does this take place?  Why should I care about Apollo Justice?  Has this series jumped the shark?  Thankfully that first question was somewhat answered in the first 2 hours of the game.  Something has happened to Phoenix Wright 7 years ago that screwed up his lawyerin' career, and I'm sure that through the course of the game it will be revealed.</p><p>As for jumping the shark, there were several moments in Phoenix Wright 2 and 3 I felt that the series was stale.  The first couple cases felt like more of the same.  Phoenix Wright 2 is the biggest offender.  But, each game ended in a very satisfying way, and Phoenix Wright 3's ending pulled everything together.  It pulled together all the cases in the game, and all the characters and events from previous games.  I would probably not be as excited for Apollo Justice had Phoenix Wright 3 not ended so greatly.</p><p>And here I am now.  Apollo Justice continues with the same enthusiasm and hilariousness the makes the series great.  The first case is a great example of what makes these game fun to play. ^_^  I think this 'restart' of Phoenix Wright will keep fans of the first 3 games happy, as well as, present a good starting point for new people to join the series without playing the previous games (though I haven't played it enough to 100% stand by that assumption).</p><p>I'll let you know as time goes on ^_^.  If you haven't played any Phoenix Wright games, definitely pick up the first one and check it out.</p><p>Also, you can check out a mocked-up demo version of Apollo Justice on Flash here: <a href="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x" title="http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x">http://www.shacknews.com/docs/press/20080116_ajaa_flash_demo.x</a></p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>Now that I'm playing Apollo Justice on the bus, I've stopped playing Brain Age 2 Sudoku for the time being.  I made it pretty far though with 91% completion.  Only 12 or 13 puzzles left to complete.  This is pretty close to make completion of Brain Age 1 Sudoku of 87%.  The Sudoku puzzles in the second game I found to be more challenging and interesting, rather than the first game where the difficult puzzles were just annoying.  The pacing of difficultly as the puzzles went on in Brain Age 2 was very subtle and really pushed you to use different techniques of counting from 1 to 9.  In Brain Age 1, it felt all over the place..</p><p>Though, maybe I've just grown as a Sudoku puzzler.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on February 21, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">February 12, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Barack Obama in Madison</h3><p>Greetings All.  Today, Madison surpassed its all-time record snowfall.  We're probably past a total of 80 inches total for the year AND there's more to come on Thursday and Saturday.  Because of the snowfall, my fancy plans to travel to Minneapolis with Tony and attend the Cinematic Titanic launch party had failed.  Driving conditions were poor, so Madison we stayed.</p><p>Luckily, there was another high profile event happening in our very city.  Democratic Nominee, Barack Obama had a rally downtown at the Kohl Center.  An excellent Plan B to follow through.  So that's what we did. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Getting In</b></div><p>Obama's speech was set for 8pm, with the doors opening at 6:15pm.  I got there around 5:45pm and caught up to Tony without a problem.  But the crowds were massive.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1057.webp" /></p><p>It's kinda tough to see, but the wonderful people that organized the event decided to funnel the massive crowd of thousands into a single entrance way.  BRILLIANT!  By the time we arrived and the time we decided to screw the line we were in, we moved about 40 feet?  I think.. about a foot a minute.</p><p>Eventually they opened up other entrances, and we eventually positioned ourselves to a point where we could get inside.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1058.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1059.webp" /></p><p>We entered the premises around 7:15pm..  7:30pm.  And, since we took forever to get inside, nearly every single seat in the building was taken.  After stooping around, we found some seats above the exit way that were covered up for unknown reasons.  Unknown enough for us, and another group, to pull the tarp off the seats and uncover the perfect spot to sit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1060.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1065.webp" /></p><p>We had a nice little perch, and eventually the arena became more and more full.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1075.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>The Speech</b></div><p>The speech had several lead-ins, starting with the student organizer and the campus organizer.  Eventually, Governor Doyle took the stage to pronounce his support for Barack Obama.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1068.webp" /></p><p>With the conclusion of his speech, Governor Doyle introduced "the next president of the United States", Barack Obama to uproarious applause and cheering.  It was a thunderous pounding roar that was really captivating and emotional.</p><p>On stage, Obama gave his speech about how he will bring about change and fix our broken country.  How the politics of the last 'decade' have screwed us and what we stand for.  I'm not a huge follower of Obama, but I can imagine it's quite similar to his other speeches.  He didn't really focus on health care or working class as much as the Bush Administration and the failed politics in Washington.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" /></p><p>It was incredibly powerful.  When you hear him on TV, you get a sense of how powerful his voice and his message are, but to hear them directly, with the same man in the same room amplifies the message and really hits you.  It's the same effect as listening to music on headphones or speakers versus going to a real club and feeling the pounding bass in your heart and being soaked with sound.</p><p>If I had one word to describe the evening, it would be "powerful."  Can't stop the signal.  Can't stop the message.  Hopefully, he will bring about change and fix everything.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1083.webp" /></p><p>Anyways, as the speech concluded, he closed on the same powerful note he kept reiterating.  "We will bring about change, and YES we can make it happen," and as he ended Tony and I got the crap outta there to beat the crowds.</p><p>All toll, the Kohl Center was packed beyond capacity.  Every single seat was filled.  All the aisles clogged.  The floor jam packed with as many people as possible.  And there was even an overflow room outside of the arena packed with people, who were treated to a speech prior to his actual message.</p><p>The papers and press tomorrow will probably have the exact count of attendees, which should be an interesting statistic.</p><p>Speaking of press, there were plenty of satelite linked vans outside as we exited.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1086.webp" /></p><p>beep beep beep beep..  Can't stop the signal.</p><p>It's unfortunate, that Tony and I missed the Cinematic Titanic launch party, but I almost think this was a much better spent evening.  Hopefully, Joel and the rest of the gang will have a Wisconsin tour in the future.</p><p>Also, if you look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080212_obama/100_1077.webp">third-from-the-last</a> image above, you can see Waldo in the lower-left hand corner.

Good News ^_^.  This contract succeeds at getting writers a fair shake at internet reruns and new form of media, but really screws over writers for reality TV shows.  It's rather interesting how much actual television and movie writers look down upon reality TV writers.  Actually, what I find most interesting is that reality TV shows have writers.</p><div class='title'><b>Lost Season 4 Saved</b></div><p>Anyways, with the strike ending ABC has picked up 9 series for the coming fall season.  LOST, of course, is on that list. ^_^.  Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof have wasted no time with the end of the strike near, to announce they have plans to finish Season 4 the way it was intended.</p><p>Originally, Season 4 and subsequent seasons, have been slated for 16 total episodes, but with the strike, Season 4 had only 8 episodes completed.  Cuse has stated today that they are going to push out another 5 episodes to complete all the Season 4 story arcs and finish it correctly (<a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35574" title="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/35574">aint it cool</a>).  Good News, indeed ^_^</p><p>So far, Season 4 has rather interesting.  At the beginning of Seasons 2 and 3, we began from the point of view outside of the cast, in the eyes of whom the largest mystery was in the previous season.  That didn't happen this time.  In fact, it did finally happen in episode 2 of season 4.  Episode 1 felt more like an extension of the Season 3 ending, but still introduced new topics for Season 4.</p><p>I felt episode 2 was kinda flat, but episode 1 was pretty slick.  Keep 'em coming ^_^</p><p>Another little bit of news, thanks to the "enhanced" episode of the Season 3 finale, and the "catch up" episode prior to the season premiere, Lost Season 4 Episode 1 netted 16.1 million viewers: one of their highest viewer turnouts in the series history.  The highest point was 18 million, i think, for some episode in season 1.</p><div class='title'><b>More TV</b></div><p>Just as a reminder, <b>Jericho</b> Season 2 premieres tonight on CBS, though you can download episodes 1, 2, and 3 on the internet if you don't want to wait.  These 3 episodes pretty much confirm my feelings towards the series.  Great characters, great entertainment, but the whole "mystery" has pretty much been revealed.  The intrigue of the series now is watching to see what happens.</p><p>Also on CBS, <b>Dexter</b> Season 1 begins this coming Sunday in its full edited form.  It's a great show, but cutting out all the death and blood in a show that is built on death and blood doesn't sound like a great move.  If you haven't seen Dexter, definitely check it out ^_^.  Hopefully, they've done a professional editing job.</p><p>Along-side Dexter on NBC is the 2 hour premiere of the new <b>Knight Rider</b> series.  This is a direct sequel to David Hasslehoff TV classic.  <a href="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2008/02/exclusive-leno-behind-wheel-of-knight.html" title="http://spoilertv.blogspot.com/2008/02/exclusive-leno-behind-wheel-of-knight.html">Here's a sneak Peak</a>.
