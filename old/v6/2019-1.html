As such, I skipped much of the games past Final Fantasy X. Final Fantasy XV really pulled me back in, though.</p><p>Every game is different in the Final Fantasy series, and none of them have connecting stories. Rather than individually rank each game, I did a tier list of my favorites.</p><p>S Tier - 7 / 7R / 8 / 6 / Tactics / 15 / 4<br/>A Tier - 10 / 12 / 9<br/>Whatever Tier - 11 / 1 / 2 / 3<br/>Don’t Know Tier - 5 / 13 / 14</p><p><I>Update 2023</I>: Final Fantasy XVI comes out soon and looks to be an absolute solid game having learned from the mistakes of XV.</p><div class='title'><b>6. The Legend of Zelda (series)</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>One of the key aspects of The Legend of Zelda has been exploration. Starting the game with the whole world in front of you, looking at all the small details in the land, and find secret caves and treasure. Each cave or dungeon always has a series of puzzle mechanics you must figure out in order to progress. It brings out the curiousness, creativity, and ingenuity of those that play it.</p><p>Much like Final Fantasy, the Zelda series of games have also grown up along with the game industry. But Nintendo takes its time to fully realize their vision for each game, and rarely does that vision ever fail.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/zelda.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>The original Legend of Zelda was too much for me as a kid, and Zelda was too hard. A Link to the Past was absolutely perfect. The environments, the music, the dungeons, and items and puzzles. You always felt like that progress you made was an accomplishment. Ocarina of Time fully realized that vision in 3D, though it has aged a lot. Twilight Princess modernized that vision.</p><p>Having fully realized their vision, they tried to innovate with divisive results. They released a direct sequel to A Link to the Past entitled A Link Between Worlds, which opened up the world. No longer did you have to follow a linear story path from dungeon to dungeon. With people used to the idea, Breath of the Wild fully realized their direction for the future while still holding true to the past. A complete open world where exploration unveils the story and many other secrets.</p><p>Below is my tier list of Zelda games. I'm very traditional when it comes to Zelda, so I don't think the results are much of a surprise.</p><p>GOAT Tier - A Link to the Past, Breath of the Wild<br/>S Tier - Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, A Link Between Worlds.<br/>A Tier - Wind Waker, Minish Cap<br/>B Tier - Skyward Sword<br/>— others</p><p><I>Update 2023</I>: The follow-up to Breath of the Wild entitled The Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom is an absolute masterpiece of exploration, story, and innovation through gameplay. It's hard to think of a game dethroning Wild, but it is better in every way. It stands alongside A Link to the Past as the Greatest Of All Time for me.</p><div class='title'><b>5. Rez</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>When I first saw online previews of the Japanese release, I knew that I had to get a copy of Rez. It looked unlike any other game released at the time. It was an abstract vision of a person moving through colors and shooting down things.

As the background sounds move and thump, your actions all execute in sync with the music.

Tetris</b></div><p class='img'><div class="gbcameraColumns"><div class="columnOne"><p>Tetris may be the most perfect game of all time. Its expert design has stood for nearly 40 years since its creation. Many parodies have come and gone, but Tetris always remains with few iterations.</p><p>The original Gameboy release was one I played for many hours. Later, Tetris DS released and became the definite version of Tetris. The movements were pixel perfect with no lag, pieces could be moved on the ground before being placed, and you could store pieces.

It was fun at the time, but got boring. In 2018 I came back, and became something that I use on a daily basis. I love exploration in games, and Pokemon Go had me exploring my town in real life, driving to physical waypoints to meet up with other people and play together. I've met tons of people around town and at events as well as made plenty of online friends, too.</p><p>As the pandemic had many people locked down in the homes, I began streaming Pokemon on Twitch with Let's Go Eevee. A lot of students and young folk began watching me try to collect all of the shiny variants in the game. It became an incredible social experience that brought me back into programming and building an online community.</p><p>Much like DDR, it's fair to say that Pokemon has changed my life, and it often inspires me to do creative works around it.</p><p>I did two inner lists for Pokemon.

As the overall mystery is uncovered, characters change and motivations make sense. It was the first game I played where death actually had meaning.</p></div><div class="columnTwo"><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/190120_games/snatcher.webp" /></p></div></div><br class="clr"/></p><p>Snatcher uses both Blade Runner and Terminator to create a unique story of killer robots, Snatchers, killing and impersonating people. You play as Gillian Seed who had lost his memory and joined the Junkers, a police division which specializes in hunting down the Snatchers. Ultimately, the plot is uncovered and Gillian Seed gets more answers to his past. </p><p>Snatcher was Hideo Kojima’s second game as a sole director. The Sega CD version was the one I played back in the day. It was released in 1994 and was the 4th iteration having prior been released on PC-8801 (1988), MSX (1988), and Turbo CD (1992). This was the only American release, and it was complete with English voice acting and cutscenes. </p><p>The music is very futuristic 90s synthwave that matches the grimey, dirty, and metallic feeling of Neo Kobe City. As the story builds, the music builds with it. It was one of the first games I played where the music set a tense mood and atmosphere rather than just being background music. Snatcher’s sound and music was written and arranged by Akira Yamaoka. This was one of his first games, too. Later on, he would curate and write music for DDR, and ultimately move on to create the Silent Hill series.</p><p>I will always love Snatcher, and I don’t think I’ll ever knock it off my No. 1 position as my favorite game of all time.</p><div class='title'><b>My Favorite Games</b></div><p>As you can see from my list, my favorite games tend to be the ones that allow exploration of a massive world, have a compelling story with unique and distinct characters, and have a unique and memorable soundtrack that accurately compliments the setting, the gameplay, or the story. I tend to value those aspects over the actual gameplay.</p><p>It’s interesting to see how my favorites list has changed over the last few decades. You can view my list from 2007 below.
