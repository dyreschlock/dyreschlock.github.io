They have negotiated a monthly (?) residency with Chicago local Dani Deahl, and they were able to get Reuben Wu from one of my favorite bands, Ladytron.  Rather than rescheduling, they just decided to role with it and have them both perform.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9268.webp"  /></p><p>Opening up for them were locals DJ Nick Nice and Mike Carlson.  Mike Carlson played a rather ridiculous set.  I think he fit almost every popular electronic dance genre into his set.  House, Techno, Electro, Electro House, Dubstep, Trance, and a little Acid House.  I (my phone) caught a couple of the tracks.</p><p>Steve Angello - Knas<br/>Freestylers - Cracks (Flux Pavilion Remix)<br/>Wolfgang - Illmerica<br/>Knife Party - Internet Friends<br/>Deadmau5 - Some Chords (i think?)</p><p>I though everything actually worked out quite well. Â Despite spanning all these genres, the whole set was pretty cohesive, and made sense.  It was rather interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dani Deahl</b></div><p>Dani Deahl took over a little bit before midnight.  She seems to have a lot of fans around the Midwest, and doesn't mind traveling up to Wisconsin to plays shows in Madison, or Milwaukee.  I've seen her before, opening up for JFK at The Mid.  That opening set was ok.  It didn't really seem like she was having much fun.  She was holding back.  She had to hold back, being a warm-up DJ.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9298.webp"  /></p><p>Last night, she was able to completely let loose, and her set was fun for the most part.  She threw in several popular songs, but had an array of a few deeper tracks that really ripped up the crowd.  Here's some tracks I caught:</p><p>Calvin Harris - Awooga<br/>that Steve Aoki song<br/>iPhone marimba tone<br/>Swedish House Mafia - One</p><p>About halfway through her set, when she played that Steve Aoki song, I think things startedÂ deterioratingÂ for me.  And then she started throwing in more dubstep, and some ridiculous songs choices, like that track with an iPhone marimba tone drop?  What's the purpose of that song?  There's no musical reason for it what so ever.  Is the crowd supposed to laugh and say, "hurrr, it's that sound my phone makes"?  I hate dubstep (brostep).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9317.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Reuben Wu</b></div><p>Reuben Wu started around 1, and begin putting Dani's set to shame.  I feel like he started off a little dry, but after a few quick songs he tore into the crowd with a much harder edge.  I recorded the first half hour of his set.  I think it starts getting pretty damn good at the 14 minute mark.</p><p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVQ40B0rG_o</a></p><p>I'm not really sure what genre this would be.  It's kinda of a mix of Electro House and Techno, I think.  I'm glad I recorded it because as the night (and drinking) progressed, my memory becomes less effective.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9330.webp"  /></p><p>It always interesting to see members of the band spin shit on their own.  I wonder imagine they play music they enjoy and draw some inspiration from.  I don't think Reuben threw in popular tracks to get people to like him.  I think he was a building a set he enjoyed and made sense.</p><p>Also, there was a decent crowd for Dani Deahl as she was throwing down tracks, but after Reuben took the stage, people started to slowly exit the club.  By the end, I think Segredo went from 400+ people down to 100. :(</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9321.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120121_reubenwu/IMG_9336.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Mira Aroyo @ The Rave last year</b></div><p>Apparently, all the members of Ladytron met in clubs in London while DJing back in the day, so I was always interested to hear what that might have sounded like.  Last year in Milwaukee, Mira Aroyo, one of the lead singers, was in Wisconsin as well.</p><p>It was a very odd night.  The Rave shacked her up in one of the side rooms, rather than either main room.  Only 50-70 people showed up throughout the night.  Most of those people were probably friends with the opening DJs.  (and) Beers were stupid expensive because it's The Rave, and that place is garbage.</p><p>Mira's mixing wasn't all that great, and her track selection wasn't very inspired.  She'd play a couple tracks, and then pick a remix of a Ladytron song. Play a few more tracks, then Ladytron remix again.  And the other tracks she played were either Electro, or Electro House, or Dubstep.  Mostly popular stuff.  It wasn't very cohesive, and she failed to build any kind of vibe.  The 70ish people there never really danced, so it was just a bunch of people standing around.</p><p>It was pretty awkward to begin with, but the most awkward moment was when she ended her set.  The crowd applauded, but then DEAD silence.  Mira gave a "Thank you", people clapped again, and dead silence again.  It was the saddest DJ event I've ever been to.</p><p>I like Mira quite a bit though.  I think she's my favorite member of Ladytron.  But after last night, I think Reuben is now my (secret) favorite.  Mira's set was pretty shallow.  And Reuben definitely proved he knows how to take command of the decks.  I'd be real interested to hear Helen and Daniel spin a set, but I doubt I'll ever have a chance to see that.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 22, 2012<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">January 21, 2012</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Sasha @ SpyBar, Chicago</h3><p>Despite a horrible snowstorm that dumped on Chicago all day long, and <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/10122080-417/280-flights-grounded-ahead-of-snow-5-to-8-inches-possible.html" title="http://www.suntimes.com/10122080-417/280-flights-grounded-ahead-of-snow-5-to-8-inches-possible.html">cancelling 280 flights</a> out of O'Hare, and despite having a horrible sore throat for the past week and a half, Five and I traveled to Chicago (very slowly) and made it to SpyBar to see my absolute favorite DJ, Sasha.</p><div class='title'><b>Never say Never</b></div><p>The last 2 years in Ibiza, Sasha has been doing something different.  He has had a residency at Ushuaia Beach Hotel, and hosting an event called "Never say Never."  As he puts it, this is chance for him to play any music he wants.  No expectations, no reservations.  Just spin all the tracks that give him inspiration from artists he loves and admires.</p><p>As such, the style of music is a bit different than his semi-typical Progressive House tone.  It's more light, semi-upbeat and rich Tech House.  But the feel is still Sasha.  The first time I heard a Never say Never, it was really odd.  The mixing and atmosphere was absolutely Sasha, but the music was all different.</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha MixMag CD</b></div><p>You can take a listen for yourself. :)</p><p>For the November Issue of MixMag magazine, Sasha had the honor of developing and releasing a mix for their monthly guest CD.  Leading up to the actual release of the issue, Sasha mentioned heading back to the studio after a summer of traveling and playing various gigs.  And out of that came a few new tracks, along with some edits, and wonderful arrangement.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/111213_sasha/cover_t.webp"  /></p><p>1.

Out of all the times I've Sasha over the last 10 years, i have NEVER seen his as energetic, on having as much fun, or generally happy to spin his tracks.  He was moving around in the booth all night, shaking hands with the happy people up front, and even gave out his headphones at the end of the night.  (He got them back, though, after he went up for 2 encores.)</p><p>Every other time I've seen him spin, he seems so into the vibe, and stoic that it's hard to tell if he's actually having fun.  Digweed is somewhat similar too.  They stand there the whole night, and build and build, layer and layer.  Perhaps they're too much into the technical aspects of mixing and set building to actually have fun?  Or maybe Sasha feels like he's being pigeon holed into a specific genre, and mixing in other stuff won't work with what he's already built.</p><p>But he was having the time of his life in the booth this night, and it completely fed the crowd.  For being as crowded as it was, everyone had a smile across their face.  Lots of hand shaking, high fives, and hugs.  Sasha's good vibes energized everyone there.</p><p>It was very different than the (semi) normal douchebaggery crowd that tends to show up to a Chicago club.  Maybe the horrible weather scarred them away.  Or maybe because the crowd was 80% dude, there weren't any chicks around to bring out the douchebag clubber within.  Or it could be a combination that resulted in actual Sasha fans braving the weather, and filling the majority of the club.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and was holding my camera in the air the whole time to capture the audio.  All the video is up on youtube right now, with a bit of a tracklist.</p><p>Playlist //<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6" title="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6">http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL97C66EF6B2F821D6</a></p><p>Chris Walsh<br/>0.

There are so many things about that are stuck in the last generation of gaming, yet others that seem to push the series forward as a whole.</p><div class='title'><b>Exploration</b></div><p>Despite being billed as a 60-80 hour game, it only took me under 40 hours to finish it.  Granted, I still have a bunch of side quests left, but I don't imagine those'll take me longer than an additional 3 or 4 hours.  With that amount of gametime, you'd think the game would be vast, but it really isn't.  Twilight Princess is definitely spans a larger area, but Twilight Princess is no where near as dense. Â Nearly every inch of Skyward Sword has something to do, and every area has multiple puzzles, plenty of enemies, and lots of little things tucked away in corners for you to find.  It may have been a limitation of the platform that there are only so many of these areas, but there's a lot to do in the tiny space available.</p><p>I miss Twilight Princess' vast open spaces, though.  The distance gave your journey a feeling of majesty and scale.  Your journey took you very far away from home, and into all the reaches of the lands of Hyrule.  In Skyward Sword, you live in the sky, and can (basically) fast travel to 3 separate locations on land.  These locations are never connected, and have almost nothing to do with each other.  BUT, there's plenty to do, and redo.  You revisit them quite a bit throughout the story of the game.  In Twilight Princess, you scarcely revisited areas unless you were on later side quests.  (though, I might be remembering that wrong)</p><div class='title'><b>Story and Character</b></div><p>Skyward Sword is somewhat quirky, but is mystical and has a lot of heart.  I think this is the first Legend of Zelda whose entire story starts from the beginning to the end.  In most Zelda games, you start off in some village and venture out into the world where you encounter evil that is already going on, and are caught up in the middle of it.  Skyward Swords also begins in your hometown, but everything is right with the world.  The evil doesn't show up until a few hours into the game.</p><p>Also, unlike previous Legend of Zelda games, Link and Zelda are very close friends, and have been since childhood.  Every other game, Zelda is the princess of Hyrule, and Link is some peasant overcoming all odds to save her.  Skyward Sword establishes their vast friendship, and makes the journey to save her meaningful outside of destiny.  It's Link's love for Zelda that he continues on, and it makes Skyward Sword incredibly <b>cute</b> and touching in story intense scenes.</p><div class='title'><b>Story Significance</b></div><p>2011 was the 25th Anniversary of The Legend of Zelda, and was celebrated with plenty of games.  There were 3 Zelda games released in 2011: Ocarina of Time 3D, Four Swords on DSi and 3DS, and Skyward Sword.  Additionally, Nintendo released a 25th Anniversary art book that encompassed the whole series.  And it had a timeline, too!  Which I mentioned previously: <a href="/old/v6/legend-of-zelda-canonical-timeline" title="/legend-of-zelda-canonical-timeline">December 21st, 2011</a>.</p><p class='img'>Here's a better explanation of the timeline:<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/zelda-timeline-full_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Canonically, Skyward Sword is the very first Legend of Zelda story.  It was first officially mentioned in Wind Waker that in each Legend of Zelda game, you're not playing as the same Link and Zelda.  Almost every character is a different person, and these games sometimes take place hundreds of years apart from each other.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: At the very end of Skyward Sword, this struggle between the Hero of light, the Princess, and the King of darkness is set up.  As the God of evil is slain, he decrees that his hatred is eternal and can never be snuffed out.  As time exists, his spirit will hunt down the goddess, and the hero will be reborn.  This conflict is eternal.  He basically spelt out the entire purpose of the Legend of Zelda series as Wind Waker did.</p><div class='title'><b>Nostalgia</b></div><p>The mystical sense of Skyward Sword are all the gods at play.  You are agents of the Goddess, and are literally fighting evil.  It mirrors a lot of the ancient stories that are sometimes told to explain who you are in previous Legend of Zelda titles.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: But the real nostalgia is what you are doing in the second act on the game.  You are tempering and forging the Master Sword.  In Skyward Sword, you are creating the Master Sword.  The same sword used in most later Zelda titles.  It's amazing to think of all the other games I've used this sword, and now I'm creating it!  Though, I feel it would have been more amazing to forge the Triforce, but (apparently) that's something the gods can only make.</p><p><b><em>Spoilers</em></b>: In the end, a section of your town, Skyloft, falls to the surface and forms what it known as the Temple of Time in future games!  Once you vanquish the God of evil, you seal his spirit in the Master Sword and place the sword in the alter of the Temple of Time.  The SAME position where it is later found in Ocarina of Time.  OMG OMG Nostalgia!  I was livid during the ending of Skyward Sword.</p><p>Though, I felt a greater sense of nostalgia when I returned to the Temple of Time in Twilight Princess.  I was actually exploring the same location that existed in Ocarina of Time, and retrieved the Master Sword from the exact spot it was left.  There was an amazing amount of build up, and execution in that dungeon that it was almost overwhelming.</p><p>Skyward Sword has amazing nostalgia but it's really only in the ending.  In Twilight Princess, it allowed me to explore it, and I felt like I was an archeologist.  BUT, these games occupy separate ends of the timeline.  It easy to uncover stuff from the past when playing in the future, rather than playing in the past and creating everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Music</b></div><p>There are some tunes in Skyward Sword that are quite breathtaking, but for the most part the style of music follows the quirky nature of the game.  It's very upbeat, and runs at a perfect pace for the areas you explore in the game.</p><p>BUT, I still like Twilight Princess better.  The Hyrule Field tracks had the perfect ambience and atmosphere that converyed the majesty and queer nature of the game.  Also, the background track for the Sky Temple is the most deformed ambient song I've ever heard in The Legend of Zelda.  It was the first time I had ever stopped playing a Zelda game, and just listened.</p><div class='title'><b>Twilight Princess v. Skyward Sword</b></div><p>Overall, I think Skyward Sword trumps Twilight Princess.  Skyward Sword doesn't waste any space, there's an actual meaningful story in of itself with characters you care about, rather than just THE NEW rendition of Link and Zelda.  Ever more than that, all the characters in the game have character, and play off each other.  The Art direction in Skyward Sword is whimsical, beautiful, and ridiculously colorful.  And most of the music complements it perfectly.  PLUS!  It's actually pretty fun to play on the Wii.  Twilight Princess was unplayed on the Wii, in my opinion.</p><p>I still like Twilight Princess better, though (Gamecube version, obviously).  I haven't played it in 5 years, so I'm probably remembering it better than what it was.  But I loved the idea of a dark, somewhat creepy Legend of Zelda title.  There were gnarly deformed creatures and enemies.  The art direction used a whole lot of light v. dark.</p><p>There are both great games, and I can't wait to see what's next for Zelda on the Wii U.</p><div class='title'><b>1080p Skyward Sword</b></div><p>The Wii U is set to come out this coming Christmas.  It is 1080p, and I HOPE HOPE HOPE that it'll upscale Wii games to that resolution.  The Dolphin emulator currently allows you to play Skyward Sword in 1080p, and it looks absolutely gorgeous.</p><p>Here are some shots from the <a href="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=395121" title="http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=395121">thread on NeoGaf</a></p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin01_t.webp"  /></a><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin02_t.webp"  /></a><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03_t.webp"  /></a><br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin03.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin04_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin04_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin04_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>The Wii only runs at 480p, and it really shows it age.  ESPECIALLY after playing games like Uncharted 3, Batman Arkham City, and Skyrim.  For a Comparison, here are two nearly identical shots: one in 480p, and one in 1080p using Dolphin.</p><p>480p: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-480p.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-480p.webp">http://theschlock.com/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-480p.jpg</a><br/>1080p: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-1080p.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-1080p.webp">http://theschlock.com/photo/120105_zelda/dolphin-1080p.jpg</a></p><p>It's a world of difference! I'm not really that big of a graphics whore, but it's definitely noticeable when it feels like you're playing through a stained glass window. Â But anyway, if the Dolphin is any proof, Skyward Sword can easily be upscaled to 1080p and looks fantastic, so hopefully the Wii U will do such things!</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 5, 2012<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">January 2012</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword">5</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/sasha-spybar-chicago">21</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/reuben-wu-of-ladytron-segredo-madison">22</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
