Thankfully, there wasn't a horrible ice storm of death, like last time.  It was actually really nice outside for a mid-October evening.</p><p>I'm not particularly a fan of Jonathon Coulton but I've actually seen him in concert a lot, which is somewhat weird.  I've seen him 6 times in the past 2 years.  Though, 3 of those were out of convenience of him performing at PAX.</p><p>Every time he comes through Madison, I buy a ticket andÂ  I wonder why.  I don't really like his music style and the crowd is usually packed with people that are WAY too into his music.  But, I still buy a ticket and attend the show.  And every time I'm glad that I did because I actually do enjoy myself.  It's pretty fun, and the show feels pretty unique, even though it's the same thing.</p><div class='title'><b>Paul &amp; Storm</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5481.webp"  /></p><p>Paul &amp; Storm have traditionally performed that exact same material every time I've seen them open for Coulton.  They start with Opening Band.  They sing the Nun song, the music tributes (the musician in this situation), the 15 second commercials, and end with Pirates.</p><p>Tonight, they actually performed new material and they didn't rely on the same formula of their past performances.  Here's their set list, which is a little out of order, and probably missing a song or two.</p><p>Paul and Storm - Theme Song<br/>The Way-Too-Early Christmas Song<br/>Frogger! The Frogger Musical<br/>Nun Fight<br/>Live<br/>Nugget Man<br/>If James Taylor were on Fire<br/>If Aaron Neville Were Waiting for a Parking Spot at the Mall, but Someone else Snagged it<br/>If They Might Be Giants were the Ice Cream Man<br/>Opening Band<br/>The Captain's Wife's Lament</p><p>Their Frogger song was pretty funny.  Starting off with new material gave their set of a fresh view for people that have seen them a couple times already.  When they sang their old stuff towards the end, it felt they were returning to the classics, rather than the same shit they sing every time.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5489.webp"  /></p><p>Like usual, the crowd couldn't stop yelling out random nonsense.  There was this girl behind us that couldn't help but yell in our ears as loud as she could.  There was some dude in the balcony that had a gasping, yelping laugh that was infectious at first, but annoying as shit after it continued for almost a minute straight.</p><p>Though, Paul &amp; Storm really feed off this crazy crowd.  They'll continue to respond to the random yelling and usually retort and continue the tangential cycle that keeps them from singing anything.</p><div class='title'><b>Jonathon Coulton</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5493.webp"  /></p><p>Not too long after Paul &amp; Storm finished their set, Jonathon Coulton took the stage and immediately began his set, which is as follows...</p><p>1. ????<br/>2. Ikea<br/>3. Shop Vac<br/>4. Code Monkey<br/>5. I'm your Moon<br/>6. Curl<br/>7. Space Doggity<br/>8. "Dead" -They Might Be Giants<br/>9, Big Bad World One<br/>10. Creepy Doll<br/>11. Mr. Fancy Pants<br/>12. Drinking with You<br/>13. The Future Soon<br/>14. Skullcrusher Mountain<br/>15. Still Alive<br/>16. Mandelbrot Set<br/>17. You Ruined Everything<br/>18. Your Brains</p><p>1. A Talk with George<br/>2. First of May</p><p>Coulton certainly acts more mature than Paul &amp; Storm, so it felt rather awkward when the crowd would yell out random crap.  I guess Coulton didn't really care, but most of the nonsense he just ignored or attempted to cull.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5496.webp"  /></p><p>As I mentioned a few times, I'm not that big a fan of Coulton.  I've seen him 6 times live, but I've never actually listened to any of his music outside of a concert.  I've only heard the acoustic versions of anything he's done, except for Still Alive.  And every time he performs a song I've heard before, it's mostly identical to what I've heard before.</p><p>When I saw Moby perform earlier this year, his set was full of songs from his entire body of work, but each one was played in a new style, or brought something new to the table.  The concert was completely unique as it wasn't just a Live version of the song, but it was the 2009 Live version of the song.  Adding Paul &amp; Storm as background singers and percussion was a great addition, but maybe Coulton should bring something else or something more to his concerts to diversify.</p><p>It's great if you've never heard him before, but his past 3 performances in Madison are nearly identical.  I guess if you're a huge fan, you probably just want to hear the "classics" rather than some experimental evolution of his "classics".  I feel his songs have gone beyond the initial chuckle from the lyrics, and after that all you have is the underlying music, which I think is pretty standard.</p><p>He needs more experimental songs like Mr. Fancy Pants..</p><div class='title'><b>Coulton USB thingy</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091025_coulton/IMG_5504.webp"  /></p><p>I mentioned that I've never bought or listened to any of Coulton's music before.  Well... that changed last night, as I purchased this Jonathon Coulton USB stick.  It's 2 gigs and contains ALL of his music, as well as, album art and source material for all the tracks of JoCo Looks Back (which is a CD of all his popular songs).  It was $50, which might seem like a lot, but, again, has all 9 or 10 CDs of his plus stuff he's posted on his blog.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 26, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 25, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Evangelion 1.0 in English!</h3><p>It's been 2 years since Evangelion 1.0 premiered in Japanese theaters.  In September 2007, Gainax and Studio Khara released the 1st of the Rebuild of Evangelion quadrilogy.  North American licensing will still up in the air, at this point.  Many Anime fans wondered if ADV could pick up the rights?  Perhaps Manga entertainment would paid a shitload of money for the previous movies?</p><div class='title'><b>When?</b></div><p>Over a year had passed after its theatrical release and STILL no American Anime company had bought the rights..  It had already been out on DVD in Japan since April, and there were no signs it was even coming to America until Funimation (of all Anime companies) issued a cease and desist order to fansubbers in November 2008.  It wasn't until December 31st, 2008 that they official stated they had the domestic rights.</p><p>One day in March 2009, with the anticipation of Evangelion 2.0, I finally decided to <a href="/old/v6/evangelion-dammit" title="/evangelion-dammit">download and watch Evangelion 1.0</a>.  <a href="/old/v6/rebuild-of-evangelion" title="/rebuild-of-evangelion">And it was fantastic.</a> ^_^  In May 2009, <a href="/old/v6/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone" title="/evangelion-111-you-are-not-alone">the Bluray</a> was finally released, and I bought it because I wanted to see the movie in absolute clarity.  Funimation, still dragging their feet, finally announced the voice cast around the same day the Bluray released in Japan.</p><p>In June 2009, Evangelion 2.0 was released in theaters and earned $5 million in 2 days showing on only 120 screens.  Each theater showing the movie earned about $40,000 for those 2 days. [<a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen" title="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-29/evangelion-2.0-opens-at-no.1-with-510-million-yen">link</a>]  It was so successful that Studio Khara now has a blank check for making the final 2 movies in the series. [<a href="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/09/rebuild-of-evangelion-3-0-to-be-released-summer-2010/" title="http://www.evageeks.org/2009/09/rebuild-of-evangelion-3-0-to-be-released-summer-2010/">link</a>]  The marketing for Evangelion 2.0 was all over the place in Japan and it worked fantastically.</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion 1.0 under-performing in America</b></div><p>Evangelion 2.0's success is a stark contrast to Funimation's handling of Evangelion 1.0.  Evangelion 1.0 has been complete since September, and they've been showing it in several theaters across the states, but it's doing terribly.  Their "theatrical" run has made a pathetic $100,000, so far. [<a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm" title="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evangelion1.htm">link</a>]</p><p>There could be other reasons why Evangelion is under performing in the states, though.  For me, Evangelion is my Star Wars.  It's a cultural icon of my past and has influenced that way I have viewed Anime since then.  I think many Japanese people feel the same way, which is why it's such a huge success over there.  The shared experience of a generation of Anime fans, reuniting with the new generation.</p><p>It doesn't garner the same mass fandom over here, because Evangelion was released when Anime was still quite niche in America.  The kids in the know and super fans definitely saw it and probably loved it.  The first time I saw the series all the way through, I was a fan for life.  But the only way to see it, was the buy the VHS tapes which sold for $30 each and had 2 episodes.  That's almost $400.  That's way too much for any high school kid to pay.  That's really why Anime clubs began..</p><div class='title'><b>Evangelion in Chicago</b></div><p>Anyways, Evangelion 1.0 has finally come to America and more specific it's showing in Chicago this whole week at The Music Box. [<a href="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion" title="http://www.musicboxtheatre.com/features/evangelion">link</a>]. Some friends and I went down there yesterday.  Man, I was so excited!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5471.webp"  /></p><p>I don't think they could've been showing a more appropriate complementary movie alongside Evangelion.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5472.webp"  /></p><p>I like how Funimation just sent the theater a cheap poster that's not even Movie Poster size.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091024_eva/IMG_5473.webp"  /></p><p>The Music Box has two theaters inside of it.  I wonder if their other theater is just as small as this one.  I doubt it could fit more than 200 people, and there were about 30 of us in there.  We were all Anime fans.  There were several people wearing Evangelion Tshirts too, which was pretty awesome. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>English Dubbed</b></div><p>I really had no idea if they were showing Evangelion with english subtitles or with the english dubbed track.  I don't know why, but I was actually surprised it was the English Dub.  I was actually pretty thankful because I had already watched the movie in Japanese at least a dozen times that this is actually something new!</p><p>Holy Shit!  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">The dub is hysterical.</span> Not just hysterical, but "font-weight: bold, font-size: 20px" hysterical.  <b>Funimation's Evangelion 1.0 puts Secret of Crystania to shame</b>.  In fact, there are several instances where there are DIRECT quotes from Crystania in Evangelion.  "If you're going to do it, do it now!", "You just don't get it, do you?" (Though, I guess those quotes are pretty generic.)Â   There were so many parts that were embarrassingly goofy, and I just couldn't stop but laugh.</p><p>If you thought Shinji was a whiny bitch in the original Dub of the series, Spike Spencer (the voice) brings it to a level you never thought possible.  It's so bad, there's no one that could possibly take it seriously.  You can't.  It's not serious.  It can't be serious.  His acting has got to be a ridiculous parody.</p><p>And it was fantastic that everyone in theater was on the same page.  I've never seen a movie where the audience was exactly in sync with the movie.  We laughed at the ridiculous acting.  We laughed at the parts that were supposed to be funny.  And were silent and polite when important stuff was going on.  It was like SPAMM, actually.</p><div class='title'><b>It's not that bad, though</b></div><p>Overall, the acting is pretty hilarious, but Allison Keith does a fantastic job with Misato.  Actually, Brina Palencia is really good as Rei, too, but Misato stands out because she's the one character with the most distinct personality in the entire movie.  It's so strong that it really feels like Misato in the main character.  She's the Han Solo to Shinji's whiny Luke Skywalker.  Which would make Pen Pen Chewbacca... i guess.</p><p>Though, her acting is only accented by the rather well done English script.  There were really just two parts that seemed lost in translation.  Though, that could have been because it was acted poorly.  But really, everything else made perfect sense and flowed quite well.  They did a great job keeping the script original and better written than the original series.  The writers definitely didn't half-ass the script.  They left the half-assing to the voice acters.</p><p>Evangelion 1.0 really does stand on its own as a movie, but leaves several hints towards the quadrilogy as a whole.</p><div class='title'><b>North American DVD Release!</b></div><p>On November 17th, 2009 (3 weeks from now), Evangelion 1.0 will finally be released on DVD in North America.  Unfortunately, the Bluray won't be released until Spring 2010.

By then, Evangelion 2.0 should be out on Bluray in Japan.</p><p>They're following a similar release schedule for the original Japanese release.  The first DVD release was entitled Evangelion 1.01.  They cleaned up a couple areas of the film, but in general it was identical to the theatrical release.  Later on, with the Bluray release, it was Evangelion 1.11, which contains some new scenes in there somewhere.  They fixed a few more areas of the film, and added 3 minutes to the beginning.  It is the best-selling Bluray in Japan to date at 49,000 copies (one of which is mine!).

I think most people probably know this game as "Jack Black's video game."  He definitely has more reach than Schafer, and Black has been in the spotlight for almost all promotion of Brutal Legend.  But, Brutal Legend has Tim Schafer's feel through and through.</p><div class='title'><b>Tim Schafer</b></div><p>Tim Schafer is known for creating games with very solid stories backed by great comedic writing that blends into game design.  His career started at LucasArts in the hay day of PC adventure games.  He co-write and co-designed The Secret of Monkey Island and Monkey Island 2, and then his role grew larger as he co-directed Day of the Tentacle.  His first true lead role came with <b>Full Throttle</b> in 1995, followed by <b>Grim Fandango</b> in 1998.</p><p>In 2000, he left LucasArts to form his own company, Double Fine Productions.  Their first game was <b>Psychonauts</b> released for PC, Xbox, and PS2 in 2005, which has garnered a very large cult following.</p><p>Psychonauts was my introduction to Tim Schafer.  Unfortunately, I skipped all those great LucasArts adventure games and still haven't gotten back to them.  It was because of its cult following that I finally tracked down a copy in 2007 for Xbox, and it's a pretty hilarious and fun game.</p><div class='title'><b>Psychonauts</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/psychonauts-game.webp"  /></p><p>In Psychonauts, you play a child who's been sent to summer camp to learn about psychokinetic powers.  These are taught by the camp counselors.  Trouble arises as many of the kids at the camp have had their brains stolen and have become mindless drones.  Throughout the game you venture into others minds to uncover the mystery and plot.</p><p>Psychonauts has some pretty funny characters with great writing.  The real comedy is the level design of the world's that exist inside of character's minds.  The characters are pretty goofy on the outside.  On the inside, their world is imbued with their theme.  There's a very strict and meticulous character, who's inner world is nothing but a cube.  There's a disco queen, who's inner world is a massive disco dance party.  One of my favorite levels is when you inhabit the mind of a fish, and its world puts you as a monster crushing the city beneath you.</p><p>The game itself is mostly platforming.  The camp is open world, and levels can be revisited to find all the secret crap.  Psychonauts definitely has its problems, but the writing and design created lovable characters and a memorable experience.  Brutal Legend follows that tradition very well but takes that blend of comedy, story, and game design even further.</p><div class='title'><b>Brutal Legend</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091020_brutal/brutal_legend.webp"  /></p><p>For Brutal Legend, Schafer created a medieval world based out of his fandom for Heavy Metal music.  During his interview on Jimmy Fallon, Schafer said that, as a kid, all his Heavy Metal albums would have elaborately designed mountains and worlds of explosions, fire and brimstone.  He wanted to make a game where you could actually walk around in one of these worlds and see what it was like.  You can see that in almost all environments in the game.  The first areas have exhaust pipe trees, and steel bladed branches.  There are massive rock effigies of Band symbols, skulls and bones of gigantic beasts.</p><p>In this land, humans are used as slaves and pitted against one another while the demon lords usurp them for their own power and rule.  You, as Eddie Riggs, rescue these humans and build an army to eventually overthrow their rule.  In the world of Heavy Metal, building an army is a lot like building a band and a fan base.  You recruit headbangers, guitarists, roadies and plenty others.</p><p>The game itself is completely action/adventure, but features many instances where you team up with your troops to attack enemies.  You can command your troops to follow, attack, and defend.  These concepts explode further into a full on RTS battle.  You build merchandise booths over vents to hell to collect fans.  These fans are used to create units for battle.  The battle is won when you destroy the opposing team's stage on the other end of the field.  The RTS battles can also be played against people, which is the Multiplayer mode in Brutal Legend.</p><p>As the game explains, Roadies aren't the ones in the spotlight.  But they do direct and shape much of the concert experience.  If they do their job correctly, no one will even know that they're there.</p><div class='title'><b>Jack Black and casting</b></div><p>Schafer wanted to create an experience that die hard Heavy Metal fans would absolutely love and enjoy.  Also from that Fallon interview, Schafer mentioned that throughout initial production and design, he kept thinking to himself, "man, I hope (noted Heavy Metal super-fan) Jack Black will like our game."  When it came time to actually cast the role of the main character, it was a no-brainer to reach out to Jack Black and see if he'd be interested.</p><p>Many of the other characters in the game are voiced by notable Heavy Metal musicians, such as Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead, Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford of The Runaways, and Rob Halford of Judas Priest, all of whom basically play personas of themselves.  Additional voice work includes Tim Curry, Kyle Gass, David Cross, Steve Agee, and Brian Posehn (who actually went to high school with Schafer).</p><div class='title'><b>Heavy Metal</b></div><p>In another interview, Schafer has said that Brutal Legend should cater to Heavy Metal fans, but should not be so niche that the general public won't get most of the references.  I'm not a Heavy Metal fan by any means, but the casting and environments are pretty obvious.  Another interesting parallel which is probably more apparent to Heavy Metal fans, are the subtle comments towards the history of Heavy Metal.</p><p>Brutal Legend begins in present day with Eddie Riggs working with a "Metal" band called Kabbage Boy.  Kabbage Boy is a bunch of teen kid bringing Pop into Metal.  Riggs and another roadie talk about how kids these days just don't understand Heavy Metal and how Metal is dead.  "The early 70s were really the days of Heavy Metal."</p><p>After being sent back in time, the first major story arc is helping Lars (Rob Halford) and Lita (Lita Ford) overthrow current slavedriver, Lionwhyte.  Lionwhyte is a makeup donned pretty boy with massive hair and leather pants, a obvious parody of David Bowie in the 80s.</p><p>Much like those kids in the opening adding horrible current Pop culture into Heavy Metal, David Bowie and other Glam Rock bands did the same back in the 80s.  They were in the music because of the style and dressing up rather than the actual music.  Defeating Lionwhyte/Bowie serves as justice to all Heavy Metal fans out there.</p><p>After defeating Lionwhyte, some story occurs and the main love interest kills herself.  She's consumed and infected with in the Sea of Black Tears and becomes completely emo.  She returns to take you down, dressed in all black with blue skin and heavy eyeliner.  She raises her army from the dead, who are a bunch of emo kids with black hair and spikes.</p><p>Ophellia's return represents the rise of Death Metal in the 90s.  Heavy Metal thought there were finally done with the complete nonsense of Glam Rock, but now they have to deal with something far worse.  Eventually you defeat these emo brats and show that Heavy Metal fans are truly the best.</p><div class='title'><b>The Perfect Package</b></div><p>I'm not sure that this concept would work with any other music genre.  Heavy Metal has a history of branching sub-genres that the core fanbase hates that work as fantastic villains.  Heavy Metal has deep roots in Norse mythology, which paint a vibrant medieval landscape.  There are axes and swords and fire and demons.  Studded arm bands.  Skimpy dressed chicks riding fire beasts..</p><p>Everything in Brutal Legend works within the aspects of the Story, Gameplay and the theme of Heavy Metal.  Schafer may have ran into some problems with Psychonauts, but he definitely learned from them.  <b>Brutal Legend is one of the best designed games in a while</b>, and it never takes itself too seriously.  It's fun to play and fun to watch as well. ^_^</p><p>Definitely play this game.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 20, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 20, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Dexter Season 4 Episodes 3 and 4</h3><p>Season 4 of Dexter has been pretty decent so far.  It doesn't have the same allure and mystery of the first season, but definitely allows the characters to show some rich emotions.  There's plenty of suspense too.  But there have been a few things in these past 2 episodes that have really shown that Dexter, as a show, is back on its game.</p><p><em><b>Spoilers</b></em></p><div class='title'><b>The emotionless nature of a killer</b></div><p>In the beginning of episode 3, the Trinity killer works away on his second victim.  He brings her to the top of a warehouse and forces her to jump off by her own will.  Getting her to the warehouse and bringing her to the top is pretty easy, but now he has to threaten her to kill herself.  He does so by threatening her family.  With her children in danger, she lets go of the railing and falls to her death.</p><p>Near the end of the episode, Dexter is hunting down the neighborhood vandal.  He discovers who it is, and confronts him in his garage.  Exposing the vandal's identity isn't enough for the vandal to stop ruining the neighborhood.  Dexter roughs him up a little bit, but the vandal refuses.  He has nothing to lose.  Dexter threatens the vandal's family, and the vandal changes his mind pretty quickly.</p><p>I find it interesting how both Trinity and Dexter arrive to the same persuasive tactics, when all other options have been exhausted.  Being killers, they have no emotional connection to their victim, their victim's lives, or life in general.  They will stop at nothing to get their way, and will perform any action to get it.</p><p>Though, it doesn't really sound like much, but it was a parallel occurrence in this episode that linked Trinity and Dexter.  Dexter (the show) attempts to profile what it is to be a killer.  Every killer doesn't follow the same code, but perhaps a killer's code has a general set of guidelines?</p><div class='title'><b>Solving problems</b></div><p>Dexter's "dark passenger" brings him to interesting places and follows convenient leads.  Though, many of those leads in the first two seasons were very convenient for story.  In Season 1, Dexter stalked and killed a couple who were exploiting illegal Cuban immigrants.  After capturing and subduing the couple, he actually talked with them a little bit about relationships and how to "make it work."</p><p>Dexter was having trouble figuring out how to act as a boyfriend to Rita and didn't have anyone to talk to.  The only people he really can talk to are his victims, those who see Dexter for who he really is.  Dexter has no trouble talking to them about this problems, because he's comfortable.  He knows this conversation and "friendship" has a very soon expiration date.  This happens a couple other times, especially when confronts the man who killed his mother.</p><p>In episode 4 of Season 4, Dexter (the show) returns to this problem solving technique when Dexter (the character) stalks and captures a woman who murdered her own family.  A woman who couldn't take the annoying, badgering, constant time loss of the daily grind of family life, so she "solved" it in a way most convenient for her.</p><p>Dexter has been fighting many of the same problems with married life, and "talks" about them with his victim.  Through their dialogue, he grows.  He finds out in himself that he really loves his family and that he would do anything to keep them from harm.</p><p>The release of his dark passenger always gives him clarity.  Room enough to think his way through his social problems.  Yes, killing does get in the way of his family life, but it's essential for his character growth, and for the show as well.</p><p>I don't remember this happening in Season 3 at all.</p><div class='title'><b>8 episodes remain</b></div><p>Season 4 is certainly returning to what made Dexter great.  I still think they're throwing too much suspense into the mix to distract away from the many many plot lines that no one cares about.  But Dexter and Trinity are the stars of this Season and are going strong.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 20, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 12, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Upcoming Electronic Music Events of Interest</h3><p>Back in July, I noticed several stars aligning themselves in the <a href="/old/v6/rocktober" title="/rocktober">Month of October</a>.

I was super surprised and excited for Moby, Sasha, and Digweed all in one month, but November is definitely out to prove something.</p><p>Why are all these DJs traveling through the Midwest during the fall rather than the rest of the year?  October and November so jam packed, I have to pick and choose the events I go to!  I would absolutely love to see Dubfire, but Deadmau5 is performing the exact same night.  Sharam is amazing, but it's thanksgiving weekend and I'm out of town.</p><p>There's more talent in these two months than all the other months out of the year.  Which means that after Thanksgiving, the clubs will be absolutely barren once more.

The set lists that he builds are incredibly progressive and technically brilliant.  Tracks are meticulously chosen to build the progression of the set into a massive wall of bass.  Every time I've seen Digweed live, I have been absolutely blown away and wonder why I don't follow him as much as other DJs.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091010_digweed/IMG_5360.webp"  /></p><p>The last time, I saw Digweed was with Sasha for their Spring tour on <a href="/old/v6/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">April 16th, 2008</a>.

At the end of both of those nights, I couldn't believe how fast the time had gone by..  Unfortunately, his set at Visions last night didn't capture they way he had in the past.  It felt a little off.  There were times during his set I felt took a little too long before pulling back into some amazing tracks.</p><p>And he played some pretty amazing tracks.

This is the second time I've seen him live and it's a little bit different than the last time.</p><p>The first time I saw him live was at The High Noon Saloon in Madison on April 27, 2009.  And that was actually the first time I ever heard of his music, too.  I had only known him from Aqua Teen Hunger Force and Sealab 2021, and didn't realize that he had such a body of work outside of Adult Swim.</p><p>I find his music to be somewhat inconsistent.  It seems to bounce back and forth between actual Hip Hop and Nerdcore.  I'm sure that's fine for people who like Hip Hop, but I'm not a fan.  Nerdcore is hilarious because I can actually identify with the Lyrics, but once he starts rapping about fuckin' people up and ass-jammin', I start to tune him out.</p><p>In a nerdy town like Madison, his performance was loaded with hilarious references to movies, games, and food.  He definitely won me over that night in April.  With the CDs I purchased at the show, I listened to them over and over, and eventually got all his previous CDs online and became a fan. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5237.webp"  /></p><p>Last Night, his performance followed that same pattern.

Fett's Vette</p><p>He also told his story about a previous show at The Annex, where someone walked in on him taking a shit, which is probably why he performed at The High Noon Saloon earlier this year.  He also complained about the Killer Croc fight in Batman Arkham Asylum, which isn't that hard.  Though, after the show I mentioned that he might want to try flipping around using the Grappling Hook, rather than walking on the wooden planks.</p><p>Around that time, he was kind enough to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5245.webp">sign my CDs</a> and be photographed with me.

I Fight Dragons is a group from Chicago who mainly before pop songs infused with Chiptunes.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5197.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5197.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5197.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5187.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5187.webp"  /></p><p>For those who don't know, Chiptunes is sub-genre of Electronic music whose sounds are generated using primitive sound devices, namely Nintendos and Gameboys.  The genre attaches itself to my generation rather easily because those sets of sounds were the soundtrack to our youth.  The genre boasts many technical artists who try to get the most out of the primitive sound set, and others who try to make nifty sounding songs.  There's a fair amount of nostalgia listening to Chiptunes, but it still within the realm of electronica.</p><p>That isn't true with I Fight Dragons, who sing about Poppy nonsense from inspirations such as Weezer.  I think their songs stand on their own without the Chiptunes at all.  I guess they were trying to figure out someway of combining their love for Weezer and their childhood?  "Just sprinkle a little Nintendo on the top and we'll be so nerdy!"  Though, I'm sure some of those dudes are pretty nerdy.</p><p>It's one thing to cover old NES songs like Minibosses and many others, or to bring instruments into Chiptunes like Anamaguchi, but bringing Chiptunes into another genre with no context, cheapens the quality of your music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091009_mcchris/IMG_5246.webp"  /></p><p>Anyways, I bought their CD before the show and have listened to it a few times.  On a positive note, they are pretty decent for a Pop group.  If you visit <a href="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch" title="http://ifightdragons.com/gimmefreemusicbitch">IFightDragons.Com/GimmeFreeMusicBitch</a>, you can download some of their songs.

I love the stuff.  It's an entire full meal in itself.  The noodle are the main "meaty" course.  The broth provides an excellent complementary base for the noodles.  And there's little bits of veggies, eggs or meat for variety.</p><p>Though, it wasn't until a year or so into college, when I first stepped into the Asian Market in Minneapolis, that I became such a Ramen freak.  Previously, I had consumed the crappy Maruchan stuff found in grocers.  But when came upon the vast selection of the Asian Market, I was utterly stunned.  An entire aisle, filled both sides full of almost one hundred different kinds of Ramen.  My senses were momentarily overloaded.  I figured they would have more selection and better quality Ramen, but I had no idea what I was getting myself into.</p><p>I did the only logical thing I could think of.  I bought one of every different brand and flavor they had.  The store clerk wasn't very happy when I set a few hand-baskets full of single packs on his counter full Ramen that were all different.  $50 bought me two months worth of food!</p><p>With each and every Ramen pack I made, I wrote down my thoughts on my blog, and scored each one.  It was my quest to figure out which was the best Ramen of them all.  Throughout those 2 months, which was actually closer to 3 or 4 since I didn't eat Ramen every single day, I worked my way through some pretty mediocre products.  You can find most of these reviews in my archives, somewhere around 2003.</p><p>I did eventually find the two best kinds of Instant Ramen ever made..  but I had learned a lot along the way.  What makes the best Ramen?  How does cost factor into the decision?  What sort of things added to the Ramen really bring out the taste?  What else can I do with Ramen outside of the simple instructions?</p><div class='title'><b>Ode to Ramen, collage</b></div><p>For every pack of Ramen I ate, I kept the packaging.  I laid the package on my desk, and placed several books on top to flatten them.  After I completed my task of finding the best Ramen, I created a collage of my journey.</p><p>Though, I guess as an Ode to Finding the best Ramen, it doesn't really work at all.  But it does show the frantic over-sensitized decision I had to originally make when I found myself in the Ramen aisle.  So many choices!  Which one is it?!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091007_ramen/IMG_5181.webp"  /></p><p>By the way, the Answer can be found in the lower left hand side, <b>Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun</b> (which is Korean and may no longer exist), and on the left hand side, <b>Mama's Tomyun Shrimp</b> (which is Thai and can be found at Copps).</p><div class='title'><b>Dr. Suess' Ramen</b></div><p>Of course, none of those can compare to actual Ramen in Japan.  And especially Hakata Ramen found on the streets of Fukuoka, Japan after night fall.  I ate a shit load of Ramen with studying abroad in Nagasaki, Japan.  Some from franchises, some from street vendors, and even some new Instant flavors I hadn't tried before.</p><p>When deciding on a topic for my "final" history project, I lept at the chance to cover Ramen.  And I did so in the form of verse.  Thanks to links on Wikipedia and general Google searching, finding enough information to form a timeline was pretty easy.  Though, I still ended up at the local Internet Cafe quite late, trying to pull everything together.</p><p>I wrote my script, and rocked the microphone hard!!

The concert was entitled Dosh &amp; Friends, with Dosh headlining, Dark Dark Dark opening for him, and DJ Odd Nosdam spinning some tunes in between sets.  I had never heard of any of these people before, but the event was gaining some acclaim on MNVibe, so I figured it would be a good idea to check out.</p><p>Well, It wasn't quite what I expected.  It was held in a large community center type room with a shit load of wooden folding chairs filling the entire space.  "Ok.. I guess it's a 'sit down' concert.." I thought.  Jess and I grabbed some seats up front since it was pretty empty.  As the room began to fill with more and more of Minneapolis' hippy youth, it was starting to dawn on me that the music we were going to hear tonight probably wasn't the type of electronic music that I frequent.</p><p>There were some pretty weird people hanging around and talking with each.  My little sister and I kept ourselves busy by pointing out some other these people to each other.  After 20 minutes rolled on by (we got there kinda early), the room will pretty full.  The lights dimmed.  And some of those people we noticed earlier took the stage.  It was Dark Dark Dark..  And the crowd went overly politely silent.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2302.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2304.webp"  /></p><p>They began singing some songs with the audience at complete attention.  After each tune, the audience cheered and applauded for about 15 to 20 seconds, and then DEAD silence.  I mean, absolute silence in the entire hall of 300 or 400 people.  Not a single word was spoken for another 10 seconds, and they began their next song.  After they finished their song, there was applause and cheer and SILENCE.  It was the weirdest, most awkward concert experience I've ever had.</p><p>But Dark Dark Dark plays some interesting music.  The accordion brings an incredible old Italian romantic feel to their songs.  The banjo keeps the songs from getting too serious, and adds a laid-back layer to the sound.  And they have some cellos to provide bass lines.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2313.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/081227_dosh/IMG_2317.webp"  /></p><p>Even though it's very different from the "normal" music I listen to, their songs were very passionate and conveyed a very unique sound.  It's romantic and lonely and desperate and very human.  It feels like so much of their lives are each of their songs.  After listening to their music, it's like I just had a long conversation with them about their lives and how they live.</p><p>After performing several songs, the atmosphere of The Cedar became a little less awkward.  Head band members Nona Marie Invie and Marshall LaCount began chatting a little bit between songs and provided some background context.  At first glance, I thought they were brother and sister, but my mind was blown when they first mentioned children.  I guess when people find their soul mate and embrace it, they begin slowly transforming into one person.</p><p>Their set lasted an hour and a half, I'd say..  After some setup Dosh, started his set, which was pretty interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Dark Dark Dark (opening for Why?) @ UW-Memorial Union, Madison</b></div><p><em>which happened today, October 6th 2009</em></p><p>A month ago, I noticed Dark Dark Dark were going to be in Madison.  Even though, the skies were dark, and winds were fierce, I braved the storms and went downtown to see 'em.  Upon entering UW-Memorial, the Rathskellar was full of Madison's hippy youth.  I immediately knew I was in the right spot.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5153.webp"  /></p><p>Once again, their performance started off awkward.  Not as awkward as absolute silence, but awkward for the opposite reason.  Too many fucking people talking.  There are 2 very big reasons for this.  #1) This concert was free.  #2) The Rathskellar sells Beer.  The inhabitants of Wisconsin are a bunch of loud obnoxious drunks, so when we get any amount of Beer in our systems, our self-consciousness and attention span goes right out the window.</p><p>Unfortunately, much of the on-stage conversation Dark Dark Dark was trying to have was different to hear because of the noise.  Nona asked the audience how many people were from Minneapolis and not a single person raised their hand.  She asked another question, which I couldn't quite make out, that also went unanswered.</p><p>Their music was still just as romantic and infectious as the first time I heard it.  They were only on stage for an hour, but throughout that hour the atmosphere had changed.  By the end, everyone was on their feet at the stage.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5166.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091006_dark/IMG_5173.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>The Snow Magic</b></div><p>Back in December, after hearing Dark Dark Dark, I felt compelled to purchase their album, and I did.  But, I hadn't ever been in the mood to actually listen to it.  After recanting all these feelings I've had listening to their music live, I haven't really listened to them on my own.  But, I still have the CD and plan on giving it a listen.</p><p>The Snow Magic is their only album out right now.  Though, at their show tonight, they had a Vinyl single that contains two remixes.  DJ Odd Nosdam remixes "Junk Bones", and Dosh remixes "All the Things".

I finally complete one of my life goals last Thursday.  I saw one of my favorite musical artists live on stage for the first time.  I haven't been with Moby since his beginning but since he released his album Play, I've been hooked.  Moby has a very infectious ambient sound that can calm my mood, but has been born out of a riot of punk and trance that he always keeps at his side.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5086.webp"  /></p><p>Last Thursday, his concert displayed the range of his body of work.  It was like a concert of his greatest hits.  After a few songs, I thought it was a good idea to jot down his set list...</p><p>1. Intro<br/>2. ???<br/>3. Wait for Me (Wait for Me)<br/>4. ???  (probably Jam for the Ladies)<br/>5. Bodyrock (Play)<br/>6. Go<br/>7. Pale Horses (Wait for Me)<br/>8. Great Escape (18)<br/>9. South Side (Play)<br/>10. In My Heart (18)<br/>11. ??? (Piano, "summer"?)<br/>12. Why Does My heart Feel so bad? (Play)<br/>13. We are all made of Stars (18)<br/>14. Porcelain (Play)<br/>15. "Take a walk on the Wild Side"<br/>16. Walk with me (Wait for Me)<br/>17. Natural Blues (Play)<br/>18. Porn Song from 1972<br/>19. Raining Again (Hotel)</p><p>Encore<br/>1. In this World (18)<br/>2. ??? (If I fall, let me go?)<br/>3. Extreme Ways (18)<br/>4. Honey (Play) + ???  (Guitar Hero)<br/>5. Feeling so Real</p><p>There are very very few concerts or musical events that I've attending where I knew the words to almost all the songs, but that I loved every minute of his 2 1/2 hour set.  In most concerts, the group only focuses on their most recent material...  Other groups are caught up in all their greatest hits from when they were good.  Even though, he played only a few songs from his new album, Wait for Me, Moby proves that his new album is stands along side his greatest songs.</p><p>With each song he played, the original melody and chrous was in tact, but was performed with the flavor and creativity building since its initial release.  Even though he "ended" with Raining Again, it wasn't the same version of the song you'd hear on the record from 2005.  He started off with the Porno music, and used that aura as a different direction to present the song.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5084.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5120.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Lyrics</b></div><p>After listening to The Protomen last year on <a href="/old/v6/the-protomen" title="/the-protomen">June 13th 2008</a>, I modify my opinion of Lyrics in Songs.  Even though, they skew or are sometimes inconsistent with the message of the music, they provide a very solid base for remixes and future adaptations, almost as strong as melody.  Well, lyrics are basically part of the melody.  The only difference is that Lyrics have a literal meaning in language, whereas melody is interpretive.</p><p>Both are essential for defining a song.  They are the key component for any remix.  If the remix has lost the melody of the original, it's a failure.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5122.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5122.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5122.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5128.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5128.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091001_moby/IMG_5128.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Live!</b></div><p>Seeing and listening to Moby perform Porcelain, We are all made of Stars, Go, and Raining Again LIVE in front of me is one of my most memorable music experiences in my life.

You roll up stuff, the Katamari gets larger, and The King of All Cosmos takes your ball of garbage (your Katamari), throws it in the sky and POOF! becomes a planet or a star or some other objects floating around in space.  Usually it's replacing something in space that The King had accidentally destroyed in the prologue story sequence.</p><p>In Katamari Damacy, released in 2004, you did exactly that.  There were 10 core levels to the game.  At the end of each level, you ended up with a larger Katamari than the last.  In the first levels, you were picking up dice, Mahjong pieces, maybe magazines.  Throughout the game, you'd grow larger enough to pick up humans, cars, houses, buildings, mountains, and islands..  In the final level, you'd end up with a Katamari almost 900m in diameter.</p><p>It was a unique game that stood on its own as a single release.  But with great popular, Namco demanded creator Keita Takahashi make a sequel.  He thought about what he would do to further the brand, and in 2005, released We Love Katamari.  The story of We Love Katamari centered on Takahashi's reaction to the outpouring support of Katamari Damacy.  Each level in the game is a request by a fan of Katamari Damacy, and almost all the levels center on unique challenges or environments rather than rolling the large Katamari possible.</p><p>Keita Takahashi said that Katamari should end at We Love Katamari, and went off to do something else with Namco.  Namco continued to milk this cash cow and put Jun Moriwaki as head Katamari game designer.  They released Me and My Katamari on the PSP in 2005/2006, which was god awful.  How can you have a Katamari game without analog sticks?</p><p>In 2007, Namco and Jun Moriwaki released Beautiful Katamari for Xbox 360, the true sequel to We Love Katamari.  Unfortunately, Beautiful Katamari was uninspired and felt incredibly empty.  It suffered from numerous principle problems (<a href="/old/v6/beautiful-katamari-impressions" title="/beautiful-katamari-impressions">thoughts from Oct 23 2007</a>), but in its core, it was Katamari (<a href="/old/v6/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts" title="/further-beautiful-katamari-thoughts">thoughts from Oct 24 2007</a>).  With the unoriginal story, horrible loading times, and $12 worth of DLC to make the game complete, Takahashi's original gameplay concept will always shine through.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever</b></div><p>2 weeks ago, on the 5 year Anniversary of Katamari Damacy (in the US), Namco released Katamari Forever, the newest Katamari game.  Even though, it's a "new" game, Katamari Forever is a compilation of "greatest hits" of the Katamari franchise.  It's chiefly comprised of levels from Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari.  It has 3 new levels that are unique to Katamari Forever.</p><p>It's strange that they completely ignored levels from Me and My Katamari.  Though, I never really played it because it was too difficult to control.  Maybe all those levels were from We Love Katamari?</p><p>Even though, they're the same levels, Katamari Forever has given them a modern treatment:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>All these levels have been upscaled to full 1080p.  Once you complete the level, you have your choice of 4 separate graphical representations of the level:  Cell-shaded, Wood-grain, Comic Book, and Classic.  I like the new Cell-shaded approach.  All the objects in the environment are clearly visible.</li><br/>	<li>Loading each level is lightning fast and takes 5 seconds at the most.  Unlike We Love Katamari and Beautiful Katamari, there is absolutely no loading at all during the level, which there shouldn't have been to begin with.</li><br/>	<li>In previous games, when you grew to the next size, the smaller objects would "pop out" of the environment to keep a reasonable amount of objects on screen at once.  With the optimized power of modern hardware, these smaller objects stick around for a little while longer.</li><br/></ul><br/>Katamari Forever has also added 2 new elements of gameplay, which are rather helpful:<br/><ul><br/>	<li>You can jump!  Though, it's a real pain in the ass to use the Sixaxis controls to jump, you can just use the R2 button instead.  It's really handy for getting to places you couldn't previously</li><br/>	<li>Throughout the level, you might find a heart.  There are broken hearts and full hearts.  When you roll one up it will suck up surrounding objects into your Katamari.  In practice, it's much less broken than that sounds.</li><br/></ul><br/>If you don't like these new features, you can roll in "Classic" mode which removes all hearts from the level, and removes jumping.</p><div class='title'><b>Katamari Forever Levels</b></div><p>Katamari Damacy, We Love Katamari, and Beautiful Katamari each have about 20 or so levels.  Katamari Forever took its levels from that bank of 60, and has a total of 34 levels.  Here's the list of levels you'll find in Katamari Forever</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RoboKing's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Tutorial</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star 1 - Playtime</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Delightful Dirigible)<br/><b>Make a Star 2 - Calories</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Munchies Manor)<br/><b>Make a Star 3 - Rich</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Lady Luck Casino)<br/><b>Make a Star 4 - Constellations</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Hubble Horoscope)<br/><b>Make a Star 5 - Underwater</b> (We Love Katamari - Inner Tube Guy - Underwater Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 6 - Animals</b> (We Love Katamari - Tan Dog - Friend Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star 7 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 4)<br/><b>Make a Star 8 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Old Guy - As Large As Possible 3)<br/><b>Make a Star 9 - Energy</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dynaville)<br/><b>Make a Star 10 - As Large as Possible</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make a Star 8)<br/><b>Make a Star 11 - As Large as Possible</b> (We Love Katamari - Bird/Elephant As Large as Possible 5)<br/><b>Make the Moon</b> (Katamari Damacy - Make the Moon)<br/><b>Katamari Sprinkler</b> (Katamari Forever)<br/><b>Make a Star - Race</b> (We Love Katamari - Racecar Guy - Racetrack Stage)<br/><b>Make a Star - Danger</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Dangerous Colony)<br/><b>Farewell!</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The King's Cosmos</span><br/><b>Gingerbread House</b> (We Love Katamari - Hansel &amp; Gretel - Candy Stage)<br/><b>Clean Up</b> (We Love Katamari - Cleaning Lady - 100 Objects Stage)<br/><b>Cows and Bears</b> (We Love Katamari - Cow/Bear guy - Cow/Bear Stage)<br/><b>Money</b> (We Love Katamari - "Save the Pandas" Guy - Money Stage)<br/><b>Fireflies</b> (We Love Katamari - Studying Guy - Firefly Stage)<br/><b>Sumo</b> (We Love Katamari - Mini Sumo - Sumo Stage)<br/><b>Shopping</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Fancy &amp; Schmancy)<br/><b>School</b> (We Love Katamari - Teacher - School Stage)<br/><b>Camp</b> (We Love Katamari - Campfire Guy - Fireball Stage)<br/><b>Limited to 50</b> (We Love Katamari - Baby - 50 Item Limit Stage)<br/><b>Snowman</b> (We Love Katamari - Snow Guy - Snowman Stage)<br/><b>Hot Stuff</b> (Beautiful Katamari - Roller Roaster)<br/><b>Small Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Small Just-right)<br/><b>Medium Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Medium Just-right)<br/><b>Large Just-right</b> (We Love Katamari - Hola Girl - Large Just-right)<br/><b>Wake up the King</b> (Beautfiul Katamari - Schloss Kosmos)<br/><b>The King's Dream</b> (Katamari Forever)</p><p>Katamari Forever has the unique variety of challenges found in We Love Katamari and, to a lesser extent, Beautiful Katamari, along with the growing scale found throughout all the games in the series.</p><p>Unfortunately, the scale is very scattered.  There's no sense of starting off small and eventually growing large from level to level.  By the time you've gotten to "Make a Star 7", which is The House from Katamari Damacy, the first level where you're big enough to roll up humans, you've already rolled up cars in "Cows and Bears" and horses in "Constellations".  Katamari Forever doesn't start building up scale a few levels after that.</p><p>I remember the first time in Katamari Damacy when I rolled up that little girl in The House.  In each level before that, you could roll up small animals, but the game made a point of making humans just a little bit too large for you to capture.  It wasn't until you completed The House, and rolled large enough afterward that you could envelope that girl.  It really made you work for it.  In the next level, you had to work at it again.  This time you could roll up adults, if you made it well past the level's goal.</p><p>Besides being inconsistent, New-comers to the Katamari series will have no concept of this at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Overall</b></div><p>Though, this game is really made for the fans.  Most of the best levels from the 3 core games of the franchise are in one spot.  They play and look better than they ever have before, so I can't complain too much.  I no longer have to wait through horrible load times in We Love Katamari or Beautiful Katamari...  I can pop in Katamari Forever and roll away pretty quickly.</p><p>Unfortunately, after a week of playing, I've almost unlocked everything.  Playing these level for a second time is pretty fun, but I've already played them to death in their original games...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091002_katamari/IMG_5141.webp"  /></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 4, 2009<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">October 2009</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/katamari-forever">4</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/moby-fine-line-music-cafe-minneapolis">5</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/dark-dark-dark">6</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/i-love-ramen">7</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/john-digweed-visions-chicago">11</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/upcoming-electronic-music-events-of-interest">12</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/brutal-legend">20</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/evangelion-10-in-english">25</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/jonathon-coulton-majestic-madison">26</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
