O_o.</p><p>After my japanese class on Friday, i met up with Mark about some school festivel deal that he wanted to talk to me about.</p><p>Each year, on the first weekend of November, the Nagasaki school holds an international festivel where each culture presents a food dish for sale.  This year, since the american group was so large, they were able to split us up into 2 groups.  Mark went through all this paperwork on his own since the deadline was actually today.  He bought Shane in charge of one of the groups and myself in charge of the other.</p><p>All the paperwork was filled out and set to go, except we needed to make an advertisement for the festivel pamphlet.  Mark had signed up the other group to work on Hamburgers, and signed up us to do Tacos... O_o.  the great american food, apparently.  That's fine ^_^.  Tacos are delicious.</p><p>I ran down to the office to get the form needed to make an advertisement and spent a good part of the day drawing it out:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04082.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04082.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04082.webp" /></p><p>Wheeee...  i forgot to write a bunch of Engrish on it though like... "Enjoy tasty delicious American sensation in your Mouth!"..  or "Taco is American super awesome delight"..  or something like that.  oh well.  The women down in the international office thought it was pretty slick.</p><p>While drawing this up, i mentioned those kickass Evangelion Mermaid statues to Kyle, and told him i'd pay him 1000 yen for each statue he would win me.  Kyle has been rather addicting to those crane games, but unfortunately (or fortunately) he hasn't found one that had anything he liked..  The thought of making some money on them did appeal to him, so we walked down to Sega World after school.</p><p>I started off by putting $2 in the machine to see if i could get something.  It seemed pretty easy.  You just needed to line up the horizontal, line up the vertical, and hit the clench button when the crane was lined up with the holes in the side of the box.  Piece of cake ^_^.</p><p>Well i missed the first time.  Then i put a $5 coin in the machine for 3 tries.  I came closer and closer to victory.</p><p>I was $7 down, but it seemed so easy.  I put in another $5 coin and made way to the asuka statue.  Left Left a little, then back and....  CLENCH.  HUZZAH!..  a perfect grasp.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04083.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04083.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04083.webp" /></p><p>cha-ching!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04085.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04085.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04085.webp" /></p><p>I still had 2 tries left..  so i made way for the nearby Rei statue.  Arghhh... so close.  and Again with another miss.  $12 for one statue..  But if i got the Rei statue, then i'd have 2 for $14.  That seemed like a good deal.  Left Left, Up and CLENCH!..  miss.  Left Left, up and CLENCH!.. miss.  Whatever.. one more try then i'm quitting..  Left Left, Up and CLENCH!...  ahh.. dammit.  So DAMN close that time...  I thought i had lost it, but as the Crane moved back up, and actually held onto the box.  Whoo hoo..  The box fell out of the grasp halfway up, but it fell down all the same.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04086.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04086.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04086.webp" /></p><p>Wheeee....</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04089.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04089.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060929_stuff/DSC04089.webp" /></p><p>Ahh... it feels good to get what you want for a reasonable price.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 29, 2006<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 28, 2006</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Karma?</h3><p>so it looks like my days of poking stray cats with sticks have come full circle.</p><p>Last night, a cute little kitty found itself inside our dorm.  Once Bryan saw the cute little fur ball, it took off running in the opposite direction down the hallway, straight into the Kitchen.  One of the japanese guys was cooking dinner inside, so the kitty stopped in it's tracks and shot off down the hall again.  This time it found itself in my room where i was 'reading' a magazine.</p><p>"holy crap! more humans..  oh my god!?," the cute kitten thought in terror as it turned the hell around and shut back down the hall from where it came.  Bryan and the japanese guy had the hallway cornered off, so it turned around pretty fast.  It shot down the hallway right in front of me as i jumped out of my room.  It tried to runaway as fast as it could, but stood still as its claws scrapped against the slippery bare wood floors.</p><p>I leaned down and snatcher it in my grasp.  The little sweetheart went furious in my hands, thinking it would be done for.  She scratched and bit at my hand for me to release my grasp, all while hissing her little head off.</p><p>"ARharhgghhgghhgg.... gawd," as i tried to hold on to her.  Finally the pain was too much, and i tossed her out the nearby open window onto the roof.  My hand bled quite a bit, but the japanese guy had one cut in the middle of his finger that would not stop bleeding.  The little kitty ran around on the roof a little bit trying to get away.  Eventually she took a look over the edge and jumped off.</p><p>Our battle wounds were present, and the kitten had fled.  This type of thing doesn't happen in Pokemon Snap, i thought.</p><p>She was a cute little kitty too..  Too bad i didn't get my camera out in time to snap a few shots.  I only have the maul wounds as a memory..</p><p>___</p><p>In other news, Leigh and I went to Togitsu this morning right as the stores were opening and got ourselves a copy of Pokemon Diamond.  Diamond is clearly the cool version, as the Pearl version is all pink and girly.  Most places were completely pre-sold out of Diamond, but we were able to snatch ourselves a copy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04069.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04069.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04069.webp" /></p><p>Check it out.. here's me buying Pokemon!  I'll probably write a gamelog or something about it once i start playing.  Five said that he'd take me to his school someday so that i may destroy his students in a rugerous game of Pokemon 4.  I have a feeling that i'm the one who will probably get my ass kicked, and then have a bunch of losses on my permanent record.</p><p>I took a look around the store again today and they had some more stuff of interest, such as: a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04070.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04070.webp">Pocketstation</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04071.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04071.webp">Link's Awakening DX</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04072.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04072.webp">DDR 2nd Mix</a> on Gameboy, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04073.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04073.webp">Sin and Punishment</a> for $20, a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04074.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04074.webp">The Ring</a> game for Wonderswan, and the japanese version of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04075.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04075.webp">Excitebike 64</a>.

I took a bad picture of two stray cats:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04049.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04049.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060928_pokemon/DSC04049.webp" /></p><p>They were scared of me though..

You have to be quick and cunning to snap the perfect picture, otherwise they'll run away and you'll miss your opportunity.  In other cases, you need to bait them out into the open to get a good shot.  And other cats will just come up to you and hang out without giving a shit.  And in other cases you need to poke them with sticks for fun.</p><p>I proceeded down the road to take a look into the Sumiyoshi You-Ing for some more games.

It was still about 2pm though, so i needed something to do.  I decided to venture forth into the unknown and see where i'd end up..  I took off in the opposite direction, away from the city and places that i knew of..  I came into an intersection, and went underneath a tunnel:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC03998.webp" /></p><p>Besides mountains, naturally, Japan also has quite a bit of tunnels.  We went through about 10 tunnels on over journey from Fukuoka to Nagasaki.</p><p>On the other side of this tunnel was a Hydro electric plant:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04001.webp" /></p><p>There was a guy on the top of the damn practicing Martial Arts and doing kicks in mid-air.  It reminded me of Rocky for some reason.  This guy was in tip-top physical condition.  After doing all these air kicks, he took off running past me and along the river bed.</p><p>I continued walking towards that direction, since it led back into town.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060927_around/DSC04020.webp" /></p><p>Probably the most prevalent thing i've learned from studying abroad is the amount of distance one can cover by simply walking.  Besides the 30 minute walk to school each day, i've spent at least 4 hours walking around from here to there.  I'm sure i walk around 5 or 6 miles a day.  When i get home in the night, i'm so fricken tired that i usually just instantly go to bed.</p><p>Anyways, i made my way back to the strip, bought some curry, and went back home.

I've picked up enough for the next week.</p><p>It's quite easy to make as well.  Inside the box is a little silver package.  You stick this into boiling for a little while to cook it.  5 minutes later, it's done ^_^.

Rez was originally designed for the Dreamcast with hardware and graphic capibilities in mind.  The PS2 port is a little bit muffled, since UGA didn't redesign it for the PS2 hardware, so Dreamcast Rez really is the best version.  Also, the dreamcast version was only offered online through Sega Direct, so you weren't able to buy it in stores..  I really was quite lucky to find it.  Now all i need is a Dreamcast VGA cable, and i will be able to experience rez in the best visual capacity.  Hopefully, i'll find some good headphones before i get back.</p><p>I also found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03634.webp">Lapucelle Tactics</a> with its beautiful japanese cover, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060925_togitsu/DSC03637.webp">Mo-jib Ribbon</a>, and...

It was the cutest meow you've ever heard in your entire life...  This meow could literally melt evil.  I sat down with the kitty and pet it for a while..  Lost in the cute-ness.

The road itself had plenty of trees around the edges.  My head caught a little bit of a spider's web too.  I brushed it off like normal, until i looked at my hand and saw this menacing black spider about half the size of my hand.  I tossed that thing on the ground and took off the opposite direction..  I don't care how tough you are, if you see a spider that big on your skin, you would freak out too.</p><p>five and i have had a previous discussion on japanese insects and spiders.  He said that the Japanese Wood Spider is responsible for the biggest strongest web in the entire world.  The biggest web recorded had been 2 meters in length, and as strong as cavlair.  Apparently small birds have been known to get caught in the web too.  (and) I probably had that fucker on my hand..  I wasn't going to let that stop me..</p><p>As i rounded the corner, i came across a separate path off to the left.  There was a staircase that led off into the forest.  Hmmmm....  Earlier five had mentioned a shortcut that i would find off to my left.  Hell, i'm all for shortcuts..  The road was pretty overgrown, and dumped with leaves and branches from the typhoon.   It was the old road that used to lead up the mountain before they made the current one..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02809.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02809.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02809.webp" /></p><p>Hell, i've walked through worse back in Wisconsin and Minnesota.  I'll be fine..  That was my general thought until i walked my face directly into a massive spider's web.  I fled back down that overgrown trail with my arms flailing and ripped off spider web from my face and hair.  "wahh, get it off me."  Fuck that route.  I'm taking the street.</p><p>I swear..  After today, i think Japan has turned me into a bug wuss.  here's one of those assholes i found up the hill a little bit:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02812.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060919_inasa/DSC02812.webp" /></p><p>__</p><p>Anyways, i had finally made it to the top of the hill, but there was still plenty of walking remaining.

It's look like the top of the mountain was just cut off, and then the school was built.  At the base of the mountain, lies a little community nestled between the moutain, and the main Nagasaki road.  The road has several fast food places and a pretty big electronics store as well.  Behind the school's mountain is another larger community where my dorm is.</p><p>Also at the base of the moutain is the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02639.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02639.webp">girl's dormatory</a>.

Five and I decided to start playing Quest of D.  It was actually a bit cheaper to start playing the game.  The starter deck was $5, but it came with an ID card.  Though, it was $2 per play :/</p><p>Look at this guy's collection of cards:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02654.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02654.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02654.webp" /></p><p>You get ONE card each time you play..  unless he bought all those cards from somewhere, this guy has put more money into Quest of D than I probably have into DDR.</p><p>I went over to the vending machine and bought my starter deck: A poison dagger, a potion, a skeleton mage, and a map...  that's good right?  I actually ended up purchasing the LAST starter deck from the machine, so five was fresh out of luck.  The arcade was a bit busy though, and with all this Quest of D experts around, i didn't really want to look like a dumbass trying to figure out the game.  So, we decided to come back later sometime..</p><p>Before we left, we played some more DDR.  Simple songs, and then we ended on Paranoia Survivor..  We formed a decent crowd behind us and five overheard one of the guy's saying that i was pretty impressive ^_^.  ahahahaha.</p><p>We hopped aboard a Street Car and went back to the shopping arcade in downtown Nagasaki to check around for a cell phone.  I was a little hungry, so five recommended this Takoyaki place on the corner.  I ordered some takomeshi:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02656.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02656.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_stuff/DSC02656.webp" /></p><p>Which is Tako (Octopus) mixed/cooked into rice.  It was quite delicious ^_^.  The octopus formed perfectly with the rice.  I need to figure out how to make this stuff.  It's probably done by mixing it all together before you cook the rice.</p><p>Since we were in the shopping arcade, five took me to the anime store, which was a little dissapointing.

From previous posts: Yoshinoya is a fast food type chain of delicious rice bowl menu items.  Gyuudon is their popular beef bowl which they have been unable to serve to the public thanks to the government banning the import of Beef, which in December 2003. In July 2006, the ban was lifted, but the public were still uneasy with the beef.  Today, on September 18th, Yoshinoya has decided to bring back their beef bowl.  The would start serving them at 11am and would continue until sold out.</p><p>I had to get myself one ^_^.</p><p>As i waited for five to get ready, i walked around a bit to access more damage from yesterday's typhoon.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02557.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02557.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060918_yoshinoya/DSC02557.webp" /></p><p>The top corner of this building's roof is a bit broken up..

It was pretty crazy.  Frequently, plastic bags would just shoot on by the window.  You could see things knocked down in the streets below.  Every once in a while, we'd see some ceramic tiles fly on by and smack into the ground or the roof of another house.  Also occasionally, you'd see a huge surge of light and a bunch of sparks..</p><p>It had to die down eventually though:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02442.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02442.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060917_typhoon/DSC02442.webp" /></p><p>We were in a pretty unique location, nestled in a little valley between mountains..

You could look over at an apartment building that was completely black, but some of the windows had flashlights moving around in them.</p><p>And now today... we have the aftermath.

You play your team on the playing field, and move your cards around to where you want your players to go.  This game supports 8 players, and shows highlights on the big screen in front of everyone.  Very extravagent.</p><p>__</p><p>Five showed me another game which i found QUITE interesting. It's called Quest of D, and here's <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02155.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02155.webp">some guy</a> playing it.  It's a fantasy adventure type game, that plays a bit like diablo, but it also uses a card system.  To even begin playing Quest of D, you must purchase an ID card to save your character.. that's about $5.  Then you must need to buy a starter deck of items, which is about $4.  Then you need to create your character which costs one credit, or $1.  That's $10 to start the game, and you haven't even played yet.  They have a separate machine for creating a character.</p><p>Once you've created your character, and you're set to go.  Then you can plop your down on a real machine, like that guy was on.  You need to insert cards from your starter deck into the machine which can be used as items.  You get potions, armor, weapons, etc this way.  You'll get a menu where you build your inventory for the upcoming quest and take items from your deck and place them on your person.</p><p>Once item selection is complete, it's time for the quest.  For each quest you're given an objective and a dungeon to complete that objective in.  You can take on the quest alone, with a friend, or you can do net play and team up with 3 others from across Japan.</p><p>The controls are pretty simple.  You have a joystick for movement, and buttons for attacking.  The display is a touch screen, and you touch the screen to use items, move around items, pick up loot from killing creatures, opening up treasure chests, and a few other things.</p><p>When you defeat levels, the game will spit out booster packs of cards for you.  You can also buy booster packs for your deck as well.</p><p>Very interesting...  i'll probably start playing it once i get settled in my dorm room.  Though, i can see this getting rather pricey.  I might set myself a limit from the beginning, like $25 max, and then see where i'm at when i get to that limit.</p><p>Quest of D is made and distributed by Sega and looks like it runs off the Xbox arcade board.  Here's a pic of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02157.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02157.webp">card vending machine</a>.

When you walk up to this Arch, it's actually turns a bit slightly from the blast, which partially led to it's topple.  The rest lay against the wall down the sidewalk a little bit.</p><p>Continuing along the path was the new Sanno Shinto Shrine built on the site of the old one after it was blown away.  Here's a panorama of the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02187.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02187.webp">entrance way</a>..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02192.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02192.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02192.webp" /></p><p>At the top of these steps are the famous Camphor trees of the Sanno Shinto Shrine, which survived the atomic blast as well.

Most of the tree's bark was completely stripped off from the force of the bomb.

Another plaque stated that after the blast, when people drank from the river they would collapse and die from the amount of poison that water had obtained..  So many japanese died from the river..  So many corpses would be washed down the river and brought into the Nagasaki bay.  Eventually the river was so littered with corpses that it formed a damn of rotting flesh..  "it was hell on earth," some guy said..  Once people realized the danger, everyone became afraid of drinking water..  many also died of thirst because they were too afraid of getting poisoned..<br/>__</p><p>Anyways...  we continued along and found another little <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02256.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02256.webp">niche arcade</a>.

The city itself is so rich in history, but it's set within a culture that is quite connected to it's age-old traditional routes.  Everything just has this deep rich aura to it that just completely escapes me.  It's magical my friend... lemme tell you. ^_^</p><p>___</p><p>Anyways, we made our way back to the strip for shopping primarily.

They couldn't sustain the purcahse, even though they are pretty cheap at around $20 each.</p><p>After spending about an hour in You-ing, we made our way to the electronics store for a power cord and some delicious food as well.  We found a yakitori stand on the way there:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02350.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02350.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02350.webp" /></p><p>It was pretty cheap at 80c each, so i picked up some ã­ã?ã¾ and ã?¢ã?¢ã?¿ã?¬.  The ã?¢ã?¢ã?¿ã?¬ was absolutely delicious.  It tasted exactly like bbq ribs.  MMmmmmMmmMMmmMMmmmm....</p><p>We got the power cord before dinner.  It signed up for a Point Card at the same time, which five recommended since this in my neighborhood near the university.  For those who don't know, most large electronics stores have a Point Card system that will award you credit at their store.  You get a certain percentage of your purcahse back on your card, and you can use points to pay for your purchase.  Also, they have little contests and games to award yourself points on your card to spend at the store.  It's their way of hooking you as a customer, so that you keep spending your points back in the store rather than going elsewhere.</p><p>Afterwards i finally had some of Nagasaki's famous champon noodles:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02356.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02356.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060916_walking/DSC02356.webp" /></p><p>It was so good..  very delicious.</p><p>___</p><p>Afterwards, we decided to go downtown..  like downtown downtown, to the bar areas..  though, five was getting a bit sleepy, so once we got off the street car, we went to starbucks..

It's actually been amazingly helpful while over here in Japan.  The rakubiki jiten is designed for high school students to study english.  When you load the game, the main screen is displayed right away.  There's no intro, or menu..  it's just loads the content.  It gets the meat of your purpose.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/rakubiki_jiten2.webp" /></p><p>On the touch screen, you enter in your kanji, english, hiragana, or katakana and spell out the words you wish to know the meaning for.  You can write out some english word, and it'll give you the word in japanese, and vice versa.  The recognition is EXTREMELY fuzzy though.  I find myself entering some kanji 5 or 7 times before it finally registers correctly.  Though..  in doing so, i memorize the kanji i'm trying to write because i have to redo it over and over again.</p><p>I've used it to figure out a couple things that i've come across while walking around.

I can write this into the rakubiki jiten and know that è¥¿ is ã«ã?, which means west; å? is ã?ã?, which means steep slope; and ç?º is ã¾ã¡, which means town.  Actually i've learned ç?º before from class back in the day... so i guess i should've remembered instead of typing it in.</p><p>So the sign says West Slope City 19.  Five says that Japan has a quite different way of addressing residences.  Nagasaki, itself, is broken up into several different little towns or neighbors.  è¥¿å?ç?º is the neighbor i was in.  These neighborhoods are broken up further using numbers.  19 is way the hell up the side of the mountain.  Five lives down in 5, i think.  Beyond that, within the numbers, a specific building or lot has a number assigned to it, and addresses are further broken up if that lot has multiple addresses... such as an apartment building.</p><p>It's pretty easy to find an address you're looking for...  Within the City, just get to the neighbor, then the right division, then the right building, then the right apartment.  Though, it's rather difficult for me since i've been completely set up on the gridded road manor of addressing and finding places.  I can see how this works well for Japan since it's population density is incredibly high, but it would just be a bother for America to use this system.</p><p>Driving from road to road to road makes more sense since we're spread out and have plenty of space between residences.</p><p>Anyways, the Rakubiki Jiten is pretty slick.  Though, it's not like i've been walking around with my DS writing in symbols i want to know the meaning of.  I usually just take a picture if i'm curious and then check it out when i get back here.  It's a great purchase for $42..  So if you're coming over here to this great land and own a DS, you might want to set aside the money to pick one up.  Though, if you have a good dictionary, then you're probably already good to go.</p><p>Be careful though...  don't buy the rakuhiki jiten by accident.  That one is setup for students to learn just kanji and things, rather than english, so you won't find it useful at all.</p><p>___</p><p>Anyways, One other piece of technology i've been using has been some additions with Google Gadget.  For those who don't know, click on 'Personalized Homepage' when going to Google.com.  You can add any number of little gadgets to keep yourself informed of what's happening in the world.  I have it setup as my homepage with several news site, my gmail, the weather and a little gadget i made with a bunch of bookmarks of mine.</p><p>Well..  now that i was over here in Japan, i was trying to get the weather Gadget to display the forecast for Nagasaki.  It's pretty important to know whether or not it's going to rain since my main mode of transportation is walking.  Unfortunately, the closest city the weather gadget had was Fukuoka, and that was 2 hours away.</p><p>So i thought to myself.. "hey..  Google isn't just an english site.  I bet google.co.jp has some weather gadgets to help me out.."  Sure enough, i was right ^_^.  Google Japan has a ton of gadgets that are actually in japanese too, so i can practice the language as well.  All you have to do is grab the location of the google gadget, and then input in your english page using the URL option.  Pretty slick ^_^</p><p>I grabbed the Game Watch news feed and searched for a å¤©æ°? gadget for nagasaki.  I was surprised as hell that i remembered that kanji.</p><p>On a side note: Something rather interesting Don told me a while ago was that i'd be amazed with the amount of the language i would have forgotten since i hadn't done anything Japanese in between now and then.  Honestly, i'm far more surprised when i DO remember stuff like that.</p><p>Anyways, I found this wonderful gadget:</p><p>http://weather.livedoor.com/forcast/rss/42/118.xml</p><p>It's pretty poorly programmed, but it has all the information i need.  Once again, i surprised myself by remembering some Kanji.  Though, to be fair, é?¨ (Rain) is a pretty rememberable kanji.  I mean, the kanji looks like some rain coming down from clouds.  Others are é?² (Clouds) and æ?´ (Fair).  And then there are some conjunctions used in determining the actual forecast.</p><p>If you look at the feed you'll see a line of text that looks something like this:</p><p>[ 22æ?¥ï¼?é??ï¼?ã®å¤©æ°? ] é?·å´? - æ??ã?? - æ??é«?æ°?æ¸©27â?? - 9æ??22æ?¥(é??)</p><p>The first part is the day of the week (Friday's weather, in this case), then é?·å´? is Nagasaki.  The next part is the forecast, then the High temperature for the day.  Then the date, again, for some reason.</p><p>The High is pretty easy to read since it's just numbers.  20 Celcius is 68 Farhenheit, and 0 Celcius is 32 Farhenheit.  I pretty much just use the scale to figure out the farhenehit temperature from that.  Looks like it's going to be pretty damn hot at the end of the week.</p><p>The forecast will also add some kanji to make Cloudy w/ a chance of a Rain, etc.  ã®ã¡ is some chance of, and æ??ã?? is good chance of..  i think.  So é?²æ??ã??æ?´ means Clouds with a good chance of Fair weather...  or...  Partly Cloudly.  é?²ã®ã¡é?¨ means, Clouds w/ a chance of Rain.  Sometimes the reverse shows up too.  é?¨ã®ã¡é?²..  Rain w/ a chance of Clouds?..  That must mean, chance of Thunderstorms..  I mean, that's today's weather and it has been thunderstorming a little bit, so that's probably right.</p><p>Anyways, have fun with it ^_^.</p><p>__</p><p>By the way...  if you're seeing a box of little boxes in the middle of my sentences, then you don't have the japanese font installed in your computer.  It's pretty easy to install, you just need your Windows CD.  In firefox, to have it read japanese characters goto View -> Character Encoding -> Japanese.  Something like that anyways.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 15, 2006<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 15, 2006</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Downtown Nagasaki</h3><p>Today was spent walking around, again.  Before five had to leave for work, we went to the local department store.  There were some pretty slick tshirts on the men's floor, and the movie theater was playing Xmen 3 and Superman.  We also took a look at cellphones.  I'll probably pick up one tomorrow when five has all day to shop and walk around with me.  Outside of the phone store was a gigantic ad featuring Hermes from Densha Otoko</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01907.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01907.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01907.webp" /></p><p>We picked up some lunch down in the fast food court on the bottom level.  I order some Takoyaki from this place downstairs:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01911.webp" /></p><p>It wasn't the best thing i've had.  I figured that the consistency of the takoyaki ball would have been more firm and solid, rather than a gooey mess of batter, mayonaise and octopus.  It was incredibly hot as well, which didn't help.  Oh well...</p><p>As five left for work, he got me a touristy map of Nagasaki so that i could find my way around town.  He pointed out that i should check out the shopping district of Nagasaki, so away i went.  He suggested that i take the electric car over there, but i'm not exactly comfortable with that at the moment.  Even though, plopping a 100å?? coin into the basket seems easy enough.  Besides, there's no telling what i'd miss out on if i didn't walk.</p><p>After walking quite a ways, i finally got to my destination:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01913.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01913.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01913.webp" /></p><p>The Nagasaki Shopping District was huge.  It's basically an indoor sideways that spans about 4 blocks.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01914.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01914.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01914.webp" /></p><p>Oddly enough, there really wasn't a whole lot inside.  Just a whole lot of random crappy mall stores, along with restaurants and fast food places..  I continued walking around the area, just to see what i could find.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01933.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01933.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01933.webp" /></p><p>Nagasaki is so pretty ^_^.  I circled around the shopping district.  I sorta zig-zagged through streets and alternate roads to see what was down them.  I didn't stray too far away from the main street, so that i could still find my way back.  I came back into the side of the indoor/outdoor mall and spotted a cellphone store off to the side and decided to take a look, since i was in the market for one.  This store had the same type of feel as yodobashi back in fukuoka; like, the entire store was electronics.</p><p>While peering at the camera flip phones, i noticed this teenage kid come in the store and jet up the one-way escalator to the side.  I'm not exactly sure why i decided to follow him, but when i got the second floor, it was filled with all sorts of appliances such as Microwaves, Laundry machines, etc.  I knew this kid's destination was something video game related.  Why else would he come to this floor, if not to go to somewhere else more to his liking.</p><p>I took the escalator to the next floor and was bathed in gaming advertisements.  ha ha, i had found what i was looking for: a game shop.  They had some pretty slick stuff like <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01943.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01943.webp">Rogue Galaxy</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01944.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01944.webp">Every Extend Extra</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01945.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01945.webp">advertisements for Pokemon 4</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01946.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01946.webp">the new DS headset</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01947.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01947.webp">that sweet DS mecha game</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01948.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01948.webp">the Tingle DS game</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01949.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01949.webp">a copy of Daigasso</a> (which i should probably pick up), <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01952.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01952.webp">the Gunbuster game</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01953.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01953.webp">this big Castlevania box</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01954.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01954.webp">the Limited Edition version of Berserk for ps2</a>.

I picked up another DS game holder.  This time i actually bought that slick, compact case that holds 6 games.

This high-class clothing shop featured a slogan character: Suit Man!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01963.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01963.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01963.webp" /></p><p>Which actually didn't show up so well in the photo -_-;;</p><p>I also found a place that sells crab:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01966.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01966.webp" /></p><p>I continued around the tightly compact alley ways, found some interesting buildings, and then came across the international symbol for "place to spend all of your money here".</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01978.webp" /></p><p>The whole 3rd floor of this building was dedicated to games, so i was set to spend another hour or two.  Their selection of DS games was huge.  They had a Used copy for just about every new release title.  Though, you don't really save a whole from buying Used in Japan.  Most of the time they just shave off $2 or $3.</p><p>I found some choice title though, like <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01982.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01982.webp">the japanese Smash Brothers Melee</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01983.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01983.webp">Giftpia</a> for $15, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01984.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01984.webp">Berserk</a> for $30, and several other titles i didn't take pictures of.  Even though the place was pretty big, they did not have a single copy of any Dance Dance Revolution title.  What a fricken let down.  On the way out i noticed ads for <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01986.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01986.webp">Nightrider</a>, Some new <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01987.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01987.webp">Lodoss War</a> box set, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01988.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01988.webp">The A Team</a>.</p><p>I walked up this beautiful road back to the direction of five's apartment:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01989.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01989.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01989.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01993.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01993.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01993.webp" /></p><p>Also on the way home, i passed the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01994.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060915_downtown/DSC01994.webp">Konami Sports Club</a>, which seemed to be exactly like a YMCA type establishment meant for the younger crowd.

Most people don't really care.  I mean, if you were in downtown Madison and you saw a japanese person walk by you, you wouldn't give a damn that they were foreign.  That's pretty much the same sentiment here as well,  "Ok, so he's a big tall white guy.. big deal.  not like i haven't seen that before."</p><p>The creepiest people i've come across so far have been foreignors.  They always seem to stare at me, and i really have no idea why.  The first night here, i walked past this other American and his eyes were set directly with mine.  I just looked away and ignored him while walking past.  It's like he wanted to say something to me, or expected me to do something.</p><p>Earlier today, i was browsing around in a store and this white women was staring at me as well, when i was just looking around at things.  Everytime i peered over, she had the most intense stare at me.  It was quite unnerving.</p><p>I think for those living over here for an extended period of time begin to borrow into their own personality.  I mean, you don't see many foreignors around here at all.  During this whole trip, i've seen about 7 clear foreignors and each of them has acted a bit odd when i look at them.  I think they just get used to being an outsider and lose a bit of their homeland personality along with it.  Even five is a bit kooky...  more so than before.</p><p>Seeing one of their own kind kinda throws them for a loop.  I've been kind experiencing that as well.  Even after two days, i know how a japanese person is going to react when i pass them on the street.  I'll nod or smile at them, and they'll be nice and do the same.  It's completely different how you'd great someone in America. So, you aren't going to do the same for a foreignor.  Beyond that, you can't say "hi there" or "howdy", because not all foreignors are American.</p><p>So.. I just walk by them, and they stare at me oddly.  whatever..  though, posed with the situation again, i think i'm going to say something...  or probably wave.  :shrugs:</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 15, 2006<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 14, 2006</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Nagasaki, Day One</h3><p>Today i had the day to myself.  Five was off at work, and left me with my amazing surroundings.  So i began my walk.  Five pointed out this sign to me yesterday when we arrived:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01635.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01635.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01635.webp" /></p><p>With some spooky guy trying to get the women.

There were a bunch of stray cats hanging around on the benches and nearby.  I wasn't exactly sure where they had been, so i didn't play around with them too much.</p><p>The shrine of 26 matyrs is there to honor 20 japanese and 6 foreignors who were slain defending the name of Christanity.  Around the corner was the church this shrine was dedicated to:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01640.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01640.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01640.webp" /></p><p>The shrine also featured a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01644.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01644.webp">map</a>, which i thought was quite helpful.</p><p>Before i went any further, i forgot five's number back at the apartment.

Nagasaki is so beautiful.  There's so much stuff.  So many houses and residence.  America just seems so plain now.</p><p>I got back out to the main nagasaki road to look around for some food.  I found this in a vending machine:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01690.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01690.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01690.webp" /></p><p>Deeppresso, the coffee that causes depression.</p><p>I saw five's apartment from the street too: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01691.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01691.webp">here</a>.

I picked up some Onigiri and grape juice.  I couldn't eat them right there, so i decided to go back to the apartment.  On the way back i snapped some pics of the gas station prices:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01707.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01707.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01707.webp" /></p><p>Regular is 147 yen per liter.  2.5 liters is about one gallon, isn't it?  That's about 375 yen per gallon then.  So gas is about $3.50 here.  $1 more.  I really wonder how much gas mileage some of these car get.  Most of them look pretty futuristic ^_^.</p><p>One really odd then i've noticed from the moment i got to Japan, is that all the cars are pretty much new.  I haven't seen a single car that looks older than 5 years, except for the taxi cabs.  Everyone drives something that's actually pleasant to the eyes, rather than some crappy ass car you find all over the US.  It seems like Japan actually has standards when it comes to these things.  All the more reason to pick up a Prius when i get back.</p><p>Also when i was out I found several Beer vending machines:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01713.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01713.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01713.webp" /></p><p>This one has those gigantic cans that i saw at the grocery store yesterday.  So... once i got back, i snacked on my Onigiri and checked the internet again.  It was a good rest considering i've been walking up and down hills to get everywhere.</p><p>__</p><p>Once fully rested, i departed for the department store to look for games and things.  My mission got somewhat side tracked when i came across this staircase:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01714.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01714.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01714.webp" /><br/>This sign said 'Shrine this way', so i figured this would definately be awesome:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01716.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01716.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01716.webp" /></p><p>and i wasn't dissapointed ^_^.  here's a panorama of the base: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01736.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01736.webp">here</a>.  This shrine was the center of a pretty massive grave yard, nested within the heart of the neighborhood.  There were plenty of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01737.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01737.webp">decorated graves</a> about the place.</p><p>I went up the side of the staircase, and took another <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01759.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01759.webp">panoramic shot</a>, or <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01764.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01764.webp">two</a>.  Off to the side, there was a massive staircase, just begging me to climb it:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01767.webp" /></p><p>Which gave me a better view ^_^.  It was getting closer and closer to this massive statue i've seen from the distance:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01769.webp" /></p><p>That's as close as i got to it though.  Maybe tomorrow, i'll go over to that shrine.  I continued up the staircase, and took <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01777.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01777.webp">plenty more</a> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01794.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01794.webp">panoramic shots</a>.  I kept climbing and climbing and climbing.  I turned around to see how far i've gone:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01795.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01795.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01795.webp" /></p><p>Good lord..  and there were still plenty left to go.  I think by the time i come back, i'm going to be in pretty good physical shape.</p><p>I finally made it to the top, and i whipped out my camera for some more <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01812.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01812.webp">panoramic action</a>.  So.. now i was right next to the White Hotel building that has been in my other panoramic shots.  ALLLLL the way at the top of hill/mountain.  I turned around to see what was on the other side of the mountain..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01813.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01813.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01813.webp" /></p><p>holy crap.. more city.  I took out my camera and took more panoramic shots: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01821.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01821.webp">one</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01829.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01829.webp">two</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01845.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01845.webp">three</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01872.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01872.webp">four</a>.  I stopped off at a convience store to buy some water because i was so tired at this point.</p><p>I continued forth, though.  I found another staircase that lead up to the top of the next hill.  It lead up to an empty baseball field.  Off to the side was a scenic overlook, but you couldn't really see anything with all the trees in the way.  I figured at this point i took enough pictures and was tired enough to warrant a visit back and the apartment.</p><p>___</p><p>Japanese people are so cute ^_^.  I mean, besides the girl's being hot, the older folk have been quite nice.  Whenever when someone walked passed me, or noticed me, i would smile and nod and they would always smile and nod back the same way.  Quite friendly ^_^</p><p>When i went into the rural convience store, the guy on the counter figured that i had no idea what he was saying and pointed out the cost of my purchase in a very instructional way, like i couldn't read numbers or something.</p><p>That wasn't so easy earlier on that day with the other convience store which didn't have a display counter.  I heard the cost quite clearly, ä¸?ç?¾ä¸?å??, but i kinda choked.  San byaku..  what the hell is byaku.  it's 300 something..  eh, screw it, i'll just give her a 500 coin.  when i saw the 8, it clicked.  I forgot about all those crazy conversions with 4 and 8.</p><p>The whole trip i was just waiting for some little kids to run up to me and start talking to me or making fun of me or something.  I knew it was going to happen eventually.  On my way back to the apartment the second time, there were these 3 little girls playing around outside this playground.  They were looking at something intently, so i scuttled past unnoticed.</p><p>One of them noticed me, and the whole little group started following me wondering what the hell was up with me.  Before i turned down the corner towards the apartment, i turned around to see what they were up to.  They had this "what the fuck" look on their faces that was pretty funny.  I made some faces at them, but it didn't seem to stun them anymore than they already were.</p><p>Anyways, nagasaki is rather tiring.  I spent a good 6 hours walking up and down hills today, and then another 3 hours going through all the pictures.  I would clean up those panoramic pictures a little more, but that takes too much time at the moment.  I don't want to stay in the apartment all day long editing photos.  Though, next time i'll probably rotate them so the pictures fit together a bit better.</p><p>Not all the pics i took today are shown, but all the good ones can be found here: http://www.theschlock.com/photo/060914_stuff/<a href="/old/v6/nagasaki-day-one" title="/nagasaki-day-one" /></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 14, 2006<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 13, 2006</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Nagasaki</h3><p>Once we got to nagasaki, i had to lug my luggage up this huge hill to get to five's apartment.  He kept complaining about how small his apartment is, and to not expect much.</p><p>So when i got inside his apartment, it was actually alot bigger than i thought it would be.  It was thinking it'd be as small the hotel room we stayed at the previous night.  It's actually pretty much as big as the place i was living over the summer in madison ^_^.  Though, there's absolutely no counter space to prepare food.  Apparently five eats out everyday because of this.  so far i've spent about $10-$15 on food per day.</p><p>That's pretty pricey if this trend continues for my 100 day stay.  Though, the amount of money i will get back from living in a dorm rather than a host family will pretty much cover that, so i think i'm good to go.  Once i get used to buying groceries, and preparing them i can start thinking about cheaping out for food.<br/>After dumping my luggage off at his place and hanging out for a short while, we ventured forth again to show me around this area a little bit, and to get my laptop and adapter.</p><p>Even though, Japan uses a very similar power current to the US, all of their outlets have the two prongs.  None of them have three prongs like all of our top end electronics.  Not that a third leg is really useful anyways, it just keeps you from falling down as easy.</p><p>the first place we stopped at was called london park, his local arcade.  They had plenty of fighters and shooters there, along with an entire wall of bemani games.  the Beatmania II Dx machine was huge:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01621.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01621.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01621.webp" /></p><p>although, five said it was actually rather cheap compared to the high-end arcades around.  But, we found what i was looking for: DDR SuperNova.</p><p>Before i dumped in my 100å?? coin, five brought me around the corner to this card dispenser.  You can pay 400å?? and receive your Konami e-Amusement Pass that most konami games read.  I put my card in DDR SuperNova and registered my name and location.  We couldn't find America quick enough, so i'm register under Nagasaki.</p><p>This card will keep track of ALL your scores you get when you complete songs.  I cycled through the song list, and chose songs that popped out at me as being interesting.  I found a remix of Seduction (from DDRex2), Des-row had a new song, and then a chose this catchy tune, AA, by dj amuero.  I don't think i made it 20% through the list of songs, and i had heard of none of these songs before.  Maybe i didn't get far enough to the songs from previous versions.  Also, i didn't check to see which songs were red.  I'll do that soon enough though.</p><p>We went to the department store right after this because it was getting late, and we didn't want it to the close before we got there.  We looked around a bit at some of the stuff.  Found this somewhat <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01622.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01622.webp">funny tshirt</a> and a display for the japanese release of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01624.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01624.webp">LOST</a>.<br/>We found a power adapter, picked up a blanket, and some food.  Check out what i ate:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01633.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01633.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01633.webp" /></p><p>I said to myself, "something this horribly revolting has got to be good."  It wasn't the best thing i've had, though.  It tasted like sweet soft cooked mushrooms.</p><p>While at the grocery store, i found some Superman cereal: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01630.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01630.webp">Frosted Flakes</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01631.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01631.webp">Corn Flakes</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01632.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01632.webp">Bran Falkes</a>.

In fact, i haven't seen any beer that looks like what i had bought for the Beer fest.  It appears that i was ripped off.</p><p>__</p><p>Anyways, so far has been pretty fantastic.  I woke up today and looked out the window to this:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01634.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01634.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060914_stuff/DSC01634.webp" /></p><p>Today he's gone working in Omura from 10 AM to 11 PM, so i've got the whole day to myself pretty much.  There is a shrine right around the corner we passed several times on our way back up here.

It was pretty much like a sears, except all electronics on 4 floors.  The first floor had cellphones, TVs and DVDs.  The TVs were quite beautiful.  They had these gigantic flat LCD ones for under $1000.  When i first walked over to the area, i noticed that the TVs featured some guy kiteboarding... O_o. Unfortunately, i was unable to get my camera out in time to snap a shot of the illustrious sport.</p><p>The DVD section was...  well...  a DVD section.  It was pretty much half Anime DVDs, a quarter American movies, and the rest was everything else.  They had a DVD of Evangelion music videos with a kickass cover:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01563.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01563.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01563.webp" /></p><p>The shoe is so neat..  i'd love to have running shoes that looked like that.  sadly, that's probably what it would take to get me out and about more.</p><p>I took some pictures of a few others notable things.</p><p>Apparently, the japanese release of Samurai 7 also had a over-sized box which contained little storyboard books, just like the US release: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01565.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01565.webp">here</a>.   Respect++ towards Funimation for releasing a semi-authentic product in america.</p><p>The second floor of yodobashi had more of what i was looking for: Games and Toys. ^_^  I found my Rakubiki Jiten without a problem, and picked up a DS Gamecase, which proved to be somewhat disapointing.  Their DS selection was alright.  It was kinda like a Best Buy's game selection, where they have a ton of games, but they are all the most recently released ones.  They didn't have alot of older games.  I'm not really even sure what it'd be looking for though.  They were really promoting the Recipe game Erika posted about on the SPAMM forum.  I also found Rune Factory, Xenosaga I+II, and Children of Mana pretty easily.  I also found that Custom mecha game where all the controls are done using the touch display.  I don't remember the name though, Something Something MS.  I'll probably pick up Rune Factory and the Mech game before i leave if they aren't announced to be released in the US.</p><p>I also found a copy of Zombie Vs. Ambulence on PS2:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01573.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01573.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01573.webp" /></p><p>$19 is not too shabby.  #five and i found some other neat stuff as well: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01574.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01574.webp">a Flonne figure</a>, <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01577.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01577.webp">a weird snotty kid</a>, and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01578.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01578.webp">a huge evangelion model kit</a>.  We also checked out cameras and computer things.</p><p>This whole shopping experience really just reminded me of the dealer's room at an anime convention.  It was just a ton of japanese stuff for sale.</p><p>here's yodobashi from the outside:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01582.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01582.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01582.webp" /></p><p>and another hastenly put together panaroma of the place: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01590.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01590.webp">here</a>.  The building design was rather interesting.  Basement to 3rd Floor was all electronics, and then the 4th and 5th floors were restaurants and convience stores.  The levels above that were all parking, and this side of the building were ramps to get you all the way up there.</p><p>It seems like such a waste of concrete to put your parking above your department store, because you have to use a good 20% of your ground area for parking ramps.  You could have the parking be the first couple of levels, and the stores above instead, then you'd have more surface area per floors.  I really wonder why they put their parking above their stores, rather than underneath.  It doesn't really make a whole lot of sense to me.</p><p>We walked around the train station a bit to see what else was around.  I was getting a bit thirsty, so i bought some Kirin Water:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01593.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01593.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01593.webp" /></p><p>Which really wasn't water afterall.  It tasted a lot like a weaker, more delicious Red Bull.</p><p>I noticed a store that had a bunch of CD/DVD signs around it, so i figured they had to have games as well.  We ventured forth.</p><p>The manga section was alot like i thought it would be from what i've seen in anime and j-drama:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01596.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01596.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01596.webp" /></p><p>Plenty of freeloaders.

This would be like if McDonalds made a video game.  You basically manage your own restaurant of Yoshinoya, kinda like Sim-Restaurant.  I can't see what the price tag says in this picture though, i think it was $25 though.  I should've picked it up, considering i had a bit of hitsory with it.</p><p>#five and i were a bit hungry by now.  We went over to the Bus station to get our tickets for Nagasaki, and then went out to eat, and you'll never guess where we went ^_^</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01603.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01603.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01603.webp" /></p><p>Yoshinoya. ^_^</p><p>This place is pretty tasty as well.  I bought their pork rice bowl which was 420å??. These posters were all over the place too:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01616.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01616.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01616.webp" /></p><p>(This was taken later at a different restaurant though)</p><p>#five was telling me that there was a ban for importing Beef from the US and other countries for a little while, but this ban had just been recently lifted for some reason.  This poster says that on September 18th, for one day only, Yoshinoya will be bringing back their Beef Bowl which was ever so popular before they banned Beef from the nation.</p><p>You can be damn sure i'm camping out in front of Yoshinoya early Monday morning to get myself a Beef Bowl.</p><p>Then we took our 2 hour long bus ride over to Nagasaki.  I took a few pictures aboard the Bus, but they turned out like crap..  This one is somewhat ok:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01610.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01610.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01610.webp" /></p><p>___</p><p>Everything felt rather jumbled and squished together in Fukuoka, but after realizing the scale of the city, what the hell was i expecting.  Fukuoka is about the size of Minneapolis with the Population Density of downtown Chicago, so of course everything is going to be jumbled together.  It's a hell of a lot of people in not that big a space.  I should've really researched some of these places before-hand so i knew the scale of what i was getting into.  But... oh well, I learned pretty fast otherwise.  I mean, it was pretty much like being in downtown chicago.  A big city is a big city.</p><p>I dunno, after watching Anime, playing Video Games, reading Japanese, and getting used to seeing, recognizing and operating within the Japanese language, this really isn't all that foreign to me, yet.  It's just a little different, but's it still Earth...  Urban Earth.  Just give me a map and the japanese yellow pages, and i'll find everything i need.</p><p>I suppose one of the biggest reasons i don't feel so lost is the amount of reforms the US did for Japan after World War II, where they gave Japan the blueprints for a democratic urban society.  Also, i'm with #five and he's doing all the japanese conversation, so it's not like i've been alone <_<</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 13, 2006<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 13, 2006</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Foreign</h3><p>So, on the way here, i realized that i completely forgot to bring over any of my japanese dictionaries.  I was kinda mad at the moment, but then i said to myself, "whatever..  i know some japanese.  i can get around easy without them."  It's been coming back pretty fast, too.  Most of the phrases i think of that i'll probably have to say are things that i already do know how to say.  I just need to remember them.  Things like ã©ã?ã«ã??ã?ãã¾ã?ã¯ just come to mind.</p><p>So far i've really only spoken a little bit of japanese, and that was to a guy who was already speaking to me in English.  He asked me if i knew how to speak Japanese at all, i thought i was being clever by replying: ã?ãã?ã??  But apparently 'little' to him was still far advanced, because i know idea what he said after that to 'test' me.  I've pretty much been speaking to people in english, pretending like i think they understand what i'm saying.  Things like 'excuse me' and 'thank you', which are the first things you learn when studying the language.  I feel like that out of place English guy you see in some Anime.</p><p>I kinda wish that i would've brought just a little more money.  I got 20000å?? for my trip, but i probably should've grabbed $400 worth instead.  I've already used up about $80 of it.  I bought an umbrella ^_^, among other things.</p><p>Also, #five and i checked into this hotel near by, so we could still check out Fukuoka tomorrow instead of going directly back to Nagasaki.  This room is so damn tiny.  I don't know why i was expecting a bigger room when Seb has already shown me pictures of how tiny these places are.  The bathroom is like something you'd find in an RV.  Here's a hastenly put together panaromic shot: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01560.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01560.webp">click!</a><br/>When #five and i were checking in, the desk clerk made some comments about my name being Jimmy Hendricks.  Good lord.  "Ah.. Jimmy Hendricks?  Ahaha.  Do you listen to Purple Haze?" It never fails does it <_<</p><p>We're at the Green Hotel 2 at the moment, and apparently when you come into town, the school sets you up in the Green Hotel 1, so #five figures that i haven't really been missing anything so far.</p><p>After we checked in and i had someplace to dump my huge-ass luggage, we were able to walk around town much more freely.  I had slept off and on for the past 7 hours of my flight, so i figured another couple hours of checking out places was fine for my consciousness.</p><p>We went to this little restaurant outside, which was pretty cheap.  Before you come inside, you make your selection from the choices outside in the window.  When you've made your selection, there's a vending machine inside the little restaurant that you dump your change into to pay for the meal.  This machine will output a ticket.  We just found a place to sit, and then you hand over the ticket to the waitress when she notices you.  It completely elimates the need for a cashier at their restaurant, which is a rather novel idea.  Then they only have to focus and cooking and serving.</p><p>Here's what i got:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01550.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01550.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01550.webp" /><br/>It was so good.  I've had something slightly similar to this before, but it, in no way, compares.  man.. i can still taste it.  Good thing food is relatively cheap here, i could easily go broke eating around town.  Mitsuwa's restaurants are pretty representative of Japan, afterall. ^_^<br/>___</p><p>So let's here..  I've bought 4 things so far, and my change is already pilling up.  They have 500å?? and 100å?? coins here (equivalent to $5 and $1), which are used qiute often.  Since their change is in such high denominations, they use vending machines and automated machines for alot of their transactions.  #five states they i'll definately want to pick up a little coin wallet to carry around my change.  I wonder if i can find that little froggie wallet from Naruto around here.</p><p>Also, you need to carry around your passport at all times.  I don't have my 'alien registration' card just yet, so my passport works as a substitution.  If you don't have one of these forms of ID on you, they'll hold you at the police station.  I don't think i'm going to test that one out..</p><p>So far, the idea that i'm in Japan and away from the US hasn't really set it.  I feel like i could drive an hour away from here and be back in familar surroundings.  Having #five here for me, showing me around, and helping me out has been invaluable.  If i truley did come here alone, and had to wait for the Nagasaki representative and have them show me around, i would've been FARRR more nervous.  But, being free of some set schedule and having a guide puts all those little fears to rest.</p><p>Maybe #five and i should come back up here next week and intercept the rest of you guys when you arrive, along with the Nagasaki rep.  Hmm.. but then again, it is 2 hours away..  More boring travel.  Besides, if it's this Mark guy that comes to meet up with you, it'll pretty much be the same situation.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 13, 2006<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 12, 2006</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Finally in Japan</h3><p>okey dokey.  i'm bored again waiting for my fukuoka flight..</p><p>well, the Narita airport was certainly not what i was expected.  when i think of the term international airport, i think of the scale of Minneapolis or Chicago, where there are tons of shops within.  Minneapolis is like a Mall.  Narita, on the other hand, basically treats itself as a conduit.  Connecting flights from across the globe and internally within its country as well.  That's it..</p><p>There are little food stands here and there, but they are all privately owned.  There's no 'mcdonalds', and there's no convience store chain.  I mean, overall, i know that Japan specializes far more in 'mom and pop' type organizations as we would see it, but i figured that some of the bigger chains would sink their roots into the airport.</p><p>Unfortunately because of the small scale airport business ventures, i have been unable to find my DS dictionary game thingy.  Oh well..  i'm sure i'll be able to pick it up tomorrow somewhere.<br/>__</p><p>Let's see here..  for those of you coming over here next week and flying through Narita airport, i thought i'd let you in on two big things that i wasn't expecting at all, but really weren't a big deal.</p><p>1) The airport is divided between international flights and domestic flights.  All internation flights arrive and depart from Terminal 1, whereas domestic flights use Terminal 2.  Both terminals are not connected at all, and you will need to take the shutter bus from one Terminal to the other.  This really isn't a big deal, since the shuttle bus drives back and forth between the terminals every 8 minutes.</p><p>2) All checked baggage must pass through customs.  At the beginning of the day, the bording pass guy said that my baggage was checked and would arrive at Fukuoka automatically.  Well, this was not what happened because the Japanese government wants to check everything that comes through the airport.  Therefore, most likely, you'll need to actually pick up your luggage from the Narita airport, go through customs, and then re-check your baggage in on your flight over to Fukuoka.</p><p>Unfortunately for me, i took the first advice i was given and left my baggage back at Terminal 1 after i had already gone to Terminal 2.  So.. I had to go back to the first terminal, get my stuff, and then come back to Terminal 2.  Luckily, the girl who was checking me in for my Fukuoka flight was incredibly nice ^_^.</p><p>3) I suppose one more thing that i didn't know was coming, is a customs form they give you on your long flight to Japan.  You must fill this thing out to give to Immigration in order to receive your passport stamp for your stay in japan..  It takes a minute to fill out.  super easy<br/>___</p><p>Anyways, nothing can really prepare you for how annoying your 12-13 hour flight will be.  It's horrible.  Well, at least with American Airlines' cheapest seat.  I suppose First Class would definately be a step up.  But it's still so damn long, and that's only half of your travel time for that day.  Get yourself a GOOD DS game you can waste countless hours on, and then while you are in airports, find some way to recharge it.</p><p>I don't know what i'm going to do on my way back, but i'm sure as hell going to find that USB DS charger.</p><p>Man... i really can't think of anything that would've made that flight better.  You can't get comfortable at all.  Maybe i should stop buying airfair for as cheap as possible.<br/>___</p><p>Ok...  the Fukuoka airport is MUCH more what i was expected from an international airport.  Huge spaces and plenty of shops ^_^</p><p>My good SPAMM pal, #five (or Nathan), was there waiting for me by the baggage claim, so i was in good hands.</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060913_stuff/DSC01545.webp" /></p><p>Check out the baggage claim sticker they put on the luggage:</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01561.webp" /></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 12, 2006<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 11, 2006</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">On a Jet Plane</h3><p>Oh my god, this flight is so damn boring.  It amazing how you think you're prepared to waste 23 hours playing Nintendo DS, and you can't make it half way through the trip without wishing you brought some other form of entertainment.  I blame that on the games though.  Deep Labyrinth is pretty bad, and Mario Kart isn't the type of game you play for an entire day straight.</p><p>Also, i've seen Nacho Libre twice on the flight already, and i'll probably watch it another 3 times before i land in Tokyo.  Like everything on the plane it has japanese subtitles to go with it, so i've been practicing my Katakana quite a bit.  I keep seeing ã?¬ã?¹ã?©ã?¼ during the movie, and i couldn't figure it out, until it just clicked.. wrestler.</p><p>I'm going to have to kiss that boarding pass attendant guy that i got this morning, as i rolled into Minneapolis airport around 6:30 AM.  He modified my flight path to fly out of Chicago, rather than all the way down to Dallas.  Thus  changed my flight time from 17 hours down to 12 hours.  I haven't even been on this flight long enough to cover that difference, and i'm already going stir crazy.  Ok, that doesn't make sense, Chicago would save me 5 hours?..  Oh.. i added, wrong.  That would've been a 13 hour flight, not 17.</p><p>Japan is ahead 14 hours from the US (15 during daylight savings), so i'm used to always adding 2 and 12 hours to our time to get Japan time.  I keep forgetting i have to do the reverse from overhere.  it hasn't quite clicked yet <_<</p><p>I don't think this flight would be as boring if i could have the window shutter open to watch outside the whole time.  For these long flights, they shut off all the lights and close all the windows, to give people the option to sleep, rather than keep them awake.</p><p>I really wish i would've installed Google Earth on my computer before i left so i could actually identify to mountains and lakes as we fly over there, rather than relying on the flight information solely.</p><p>The onboard flight display is rather informational about our current flight status.  It cycles through a bunch of maps of exactly where we are on Earth, along with Miles remaining, time remaining, time in tokyo, time at home, time underneath us.  In fact, I've got exactly 7 hours left before i land over there.</p><p>Oddly enough, Tokyo, Japan is almost exactly 10,000 km from Chicago.  What a weird little fun-fact that will ultimately prove useless.</p><p>One thing that never really occured to me because i wasn't thinking outside the box, was the curvature of our flight path.  I mean, yes we're flying on a straight path directly to tokyo, and the shortest distancee between those two points, but on a flat map it's a semi-circle.  I wasn't taking into account the curvature of the Earth and the flight path being wrapped around it.  So actually, we haven't even touched the Pacific ocean yet.  Currently, we're above Alaska.  I wonder if i can see that screwed up oil main...  :looks outside: .. holy crap, snowy mountains!</p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01537.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01537.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01537.webp" /></p><p><img border="0" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01541.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01541.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/060911_airplane/DSC01541.webp" /><br/>jesus, check out those last mountains.

Overall my travel is 23 hours :/..  I have a quite flight down to Dallas, and then a 17 hour flight over to Tokyo.  In Tokyo, i have a 4 hours lay over before my 1 1/2 hour flight to Fukuoka.</p><p>During those 4 hours i plan on puchasing this Japanese Dictionary for the DS: <a xhref="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-hw-49-en-70-198v.html" title="http://www.play-asia.com/paOS-13-71-hw-49-en-70-198v.html">The Rakubiki Jiten</a>, which allows you to draw in Kanji using the Touch Screen, and it'll translate the characters and give you the meaning, the romaji, and the english translated word.  It's rather well know dictionary too, so i figure that it will be rather easy to find at Narita airport in Tokyo when i'm there for 4 hours.</p><p>I need to make sure not to run my DS out of batteries on the way there though.  I should've bought this DS USB power cable, so i could recharge it using my laptop's battery mid-trip.  :shrugs: oh well.</p><p>___</p><p>Anyways, i'm outta here.  Later USA.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 10, 2006<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">September 2006</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/yen-is-weird">10</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/on-a-jet-plane">11</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/finally-in-japan">12</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/nagasaki">13</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/nagasaki-day-one">14</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/rakubiki-jiten">15</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-return-of-yoshinoyas-gyuudon">17</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/checking-out-the-school">18</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/mt-inasa">19</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/dormatory">20</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-unsen-resort">22</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/taito-afterwards">23</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/videogame-shopping-in-togitsu">25</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/nagasaki-temples">26</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/around-sumiyoshi-into-nagayo">27</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/karma">28</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/great-american-taco">29</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/taito-game-station">30</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
