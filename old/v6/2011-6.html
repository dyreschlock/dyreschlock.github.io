It's really the hub of all bus traffic in the city.  Whether they begin their journey there, or simply pass through is a matter of route.  Most busses arrive early, and must wait until their scheduled departure time.</p><p>Jim Hendricks waits at this bus stop every morning.  He walks from his apartment down the road, then waits for his bus to arrive.  This morning was really no different than any other.  The bus arrived on time and he boarded.</p><p>"It's a Nook Color", Jim replied.</p><p>"A what?"</p><p>"A Nook Color," Jim replied again.  "From Barnes &amp; Noble."</p><p>"Ah yes...", the old man finally realized.</p><p>Today was a little different.  Someone on the bus actually talked to Jim.  Everyday, Jim waits for the bus, he boards, and now recently, he reads.</p><p>A few weeks ago premiered a television program that he was very excited for.  This program is called Game of Thrones.  It is based off of a series of novels that his college friends Tony of Gregerson and Erika of then Lamm, but now of Aho had implored him to read.  These friends were of like minds and tastes to Jim, and these books had captured their hearts.</p><p>"Game of Thrones is my favorite fantasy series.  All of his characters are rich, and his story doesn't care for them at all.  He kills of characters on a whim.  The story is brutal.  And you'd love it,"  Tony had stated.</p><p>"Yeah, Jim.  You should read them," Erika reinforced.</p><p>"I'm sure they're fantastic, but these books look really really long, and reading is boring," the young and naive Jim had replied to their recommendations.</p><p>It was 6 months and 5 years ago that Tony, in a further effort to expose Jim to these fantastic novels, had invited him to Madison.  The author, George R. R. Martin, had recently published A Feast for Crows, the fourth book in the series, and was on a book tour stretching from the salty seas of the Pacific to the Atlantic.  It was here that Jim met GRRM, shook his hand, purchased his books, and had them autographed.</p><p>But Jim was stubborn, and engulfed in course work at the time.  His stubbornness persisted even after university was completed, and began work in the midwestern city of Madison.  Many of his collegues had read the works, and shared their recommendations.  <em>Man, everyone loves these books.</em> But it was only until he saw the televised product that he began to head their words.  He and his friends watched in splendor as the distinct characters and vivid environments came to life.  After a few episodes, they were hooked.  They were fans.  And it was lucky that Jim owned the novels, so they all could read how it was originally wrote.</p><p>After 5 episodes had aired, Jim started reading Game of Thrones.  He had been discussing the program with Chris of Schroeder at his office.  <em>This show is pretty damn awesome, but there is a lot going on.  I really wonder how much of this stays true to the books.</em> So he read.  For the first time, in a long time, he read.  And of the recommendations, they were all justified.  For he did like the books.</p><p>"I really like it.  I bought it mostly for a vacation, and I've been using it quite a lot since then," he continued to reply to the old's man question on the bus.</p><p>Reading the novels had been great at first, but his yearly vacation across the seas to the volcanic Islands of Japan had drawn near.  He had a mere 200 pages remaining in Game of Thrones which he could surely finish given several hours.  <em>I'm just about done with this book, but I don't have to time before I leave.  I can't bring both books with.  They take up too much space.</em></p><p>He recalled a coversation he had with Lady Kait of Stites a week or two prior.  Though, he didn't recall the conversation perfectly as it had been at a bar, and Jim drinks many beers when he's at a bar.  He thinks this conversation was born out of talking about the band they at the bar to see.</p><p>"I find it odd how much I've completely switched to digital music.  I still feel like I'm one of those people who enjoys owning a physical copy of something.  But, ever since I bought this iPhone, I've stopped buying physical copies of music.  Almost everything is digital.  The only physical copies of music I purchase is Vinyl, as I feel that's the ultimate physical representation of music these days."</p><p>"Ya know, maybe books are the same way.  Having a first edition hardcover copy of book, is like having a vinyl copy of a vintage album.  And there are many books I don't care about but still want to read.  Maybe buying an ereader makes sense for those titles.  And portability too.  I'm going on vacation rather soon, and can't hulk around those mamoth tombs with me everywhere.  It makes sense to buy one of those things."</p><p>"Yeah, I could see that," Kait had replied, though probably just to humor him, as he was talking about boring things.  She smiled, and they went back to listening to the band.</p><p>A few days later, he found himself in Barnes &amp; Noble.  He was interested in the Nook Color above other ereaders for 3 key reasons.  The first was because of his hatred for e-ink.  e-ink was monotone and had an annoying lag between turning pages.  The second point had been it's OS built on Android.  There were several articles on tech blogs saying how easy it was to jailbreak the device, and find yourself with a full Android tablet.  Unlocked, it would be able to read any file format, read emails, looks at maps, translate Japanese.  The third point was the most important given the second point, the price.  It was only $250 for a easy-to-unlock tablet device designed as an ereader that could do much more.  After an hour of looking it over, and playing with it, he bought it.</p><p>He finished A Game of Thrones in transit to vacation.  Before returning from vacation, he was able to read over half of the second novel, The Clash of Kings.  Along with those novels, he packed several maps, an itinerary, a shopping list, and a Japanese dictionary on his Nook Color, and they were very helpful.  For this, he was grateful.</p><p>Back on the bus he relayed all of this information to the old man.  "So you can do a whole lot with it," the old man replied after a second of digesting what was just said.  Perhaps Jim had said too much information, and was probably boring people again.  They went back into silence.  Jim turned back to the Nook Color to continue reading.</p><p>He has started the third book in the series, A Storm of Swords and intends to read them all.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 30, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 26, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Child of Eden</h3><p>On a console that sees release after release of first person shooters in a war setting, or in a space setting, Child of Eden finds itself among a very different crowd.  It's about as opposite as you can get from all that.  It is a unique gaming experience that takes you on a journey of sights, sounds, and color.  Brilliant vibrant colors.</p><p>What Tetsuya Mizuguchi began with Rez in 2001/2002, he has continued with Child of Eden.  The visually stimulating and pulsing background bores its creatures.  On screen, you target these creatures and shapes with the crosshairs, lock on to them, and fire your weapons.  You also have smart bombs, that take care of all the enemies on the screen at once.  Child of Eden adds a third weapon: rapid fire.  Only rapid fire can take down incoming enemy fire, and some enemies are only vulnerable to rapid fire.</p><p>Both Rez and Child of Eden seem rather easy on the surface.  Point and Shoot, right?  It goes a little deeper than that.  In Rez, you start building up massive points if fire all your locked-on shots at once.  Child of Eden continues this scoring method, but adds in a little twist.  You need to fire your shots along with the beat in order to build up your multiplyer.  Rez did this automatically for you.  Once I figured this out, Child of Eden became a much more aesthetically pleasing game.  Music games always sound their best when you play them correctly.  :)</p><p>While this game is a beautiful work of art, I never really felt the same excitement and wonder I did when I first played Rez over 9 years ago.  Rez absolutey blew me away on that winter day in January 2002.  Each level had a unique feel.  It's music was raw, dynamic, and told a story of its own.  While Child of Eden's music has a few dynamic sequences, it feel mostly flat and generic.</p><p>Rez used tracks from established artists, and pulled together 6 songs that had variety and cohesion.  The music behind Child of Eden is a much different story, and barely mentioned anywhere.   It's really just an interactive visualization for the Genki Rockets.</p><div class='title'><b>Genki Rockets</b></div><p>The Genki Rockets is a group formed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi starring a fictional lead singer, Lumi, who is a hologram (much like Sharon Apple from Macross Plus).  It's known now that the lead singer is portrayed by Rachel Rhodes, but whatever.  Also in the group is music producer Kenji Tamai.  All other members are secret, apparently.</p><p>The group began in 2006 when Mizuguchi wrote the song "Heavenly Star", made a colorful video, and posted it to youtube.  It went viral, and became a huge success.</p><p>Like all other J-Pop groups who have fictional characters as band members, they have a detailed back story, and this is the same story that sets up Child of Eden.  Lumi is the first human born in space on September 11th, 2019 (NEVER FORGET).  She expresses her thoughts and feelings through songs, and sends them as messages to earth.</p><p>The Genki Rockets have a unique live performance involving the visual component as highly as the audio.  Since Lumi is in space, and has never been to earth, her appearance is projected on stage using hologram-like technology.  The wikipedia articles states the technology is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musion_Eyeliner">Musion Eyeliner</a>, which is basically just using a large LED screen that gives the appearance of projecting.</p><p>They really don't have that many songs.  "Heavenly Star" premiered in 2006, and was featured in Lumines II.  In 2007, the recorded a couple more singles, and in 2008, they recorded enough to release an album.  They really haven't done a whole lot up until now.  Here's their tracklist for Child of Eden:</p><p>Stage 1 - Matrix - <b>Fly!</b> (2008)<br/>Stage 2 - Evolution - <b>Star Line</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 3 - Beauty - <b>Breeze</b> (2007)<br/>Stage 4 - Passion - <b>Maker</b> (2011)<br/>Stage 5 - Journey - <b>Heavenly Star</b> (2006) &amp; <b>Flow</b> (2011)</p><p>Check out their website: <a href="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/" title="http://www.genkirockets.com/en/news/">Genki Rockets dot Com</a>.  They have a live streamed concert on Ustream happening on Tuesday!</p><div class='title'><b>Extended Story</b></div><p>Child of Eden expands on Lumi's story.  With her music, mankind is inspired to explore the vast reaches of outer space.  With their exploration, the Internet expands and grows.  The Internet can be accessed anywhere humans have reached.  And the Internet is renamed to Eden.  Eden is the fountain that which all knowledge flows.</p><p>In the 23rd century, humans rebuild Lumi's likeness and personality in Eden.  Project Lumi nears completion, but is compremised by a virus attack.  And this is where you come in.  Protect Lumi, and complete the project.</p><p>Incidentally, the story of Rez picks up after Lumi is completed.  Later on, Lumi becomes the central AI for Eden and controls the flow of information.  However, the information is vast, and the task becomes overwhelming.  Lumi shuts down, and exposes Eden to all manor of virus attacks.  In Rez, you explore from your local areas of Eden to the central mainframes.  You take down rouge programs and viruses, while rebooting Lumi and restoring order.</p><p>It's rather interesting how Child of Eden portrays the future Internet as a lush utopia of wonder and beauty.  While the future beyond that in Rez is dark and crippled.</p><div class='title'><b>Thoughts</b></div><p>Child of Eden seems like the ultimate goal of Mizuguchi's plan for the Genki Rockets.  I really wonder at what point did that plan began.  Unfortunately I'm not as familiar as I should be with his works.  I consider myself a fan, but I haven't played anything of his since Rez.</p><p>After leaving Sega in 2003, he formed Q? Entertainment, and they've made Meteos, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and Gunpey.  Lumines is their huge money maker, and it makes heavy use of music.  Is all that music licensed?  or is it all original tracks developed in house?  I should play that game.</p><p>I wonder if the Genki Rockets was just some weekend project.  He got some of his pals together, jammed, and wrote a song.  Then he started working on the video, and then posted it to see what some of his fans thought.  With its huge viral success, he probably just wanted to see how far he could take it.</p><p>Then again, the Genki Rockets had all their fame in 2006 to 2008.  They sat on the back burner for 3 years until now with Child of Eden.  And you barely see the name "Genki Rockets" anywhere.  Mizuguchi is just retconning Rez to be canon with his washed up JPop band.</p><p>I'd be real interested to know the actual story behind all of this.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 26, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 23, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Gabriel &amp; Dresden</h3><p>My favorite trance duo of all time is Josh Gabriel and Dave Dresden.  I've been of a fan of theirs since near the beginning, and some of their DJ sets I could listen to hours and hours over and over.  When they're on, they have the perfect mix of ambiance, harmony, and melody complete with an underlying beat that never tires me.</p><div class='title'><b>The Beginning</b></div><p>The duo formed around 2001 and 2002.  I think they really made it big when the played at the Pawn Shop at WMC 2002.  Later that year, Markus Schulz started featuring them on the Global DJ Broadcast every few months.  Leading into WMC 2003, they had their own Essential Mix, and during WMC 2003 their popularity exploded.</p><p>They first I had heard of them wasn't too long after that.  At the time, I was downloading DJ sets from the website djmixes2k.com.  Each week, they'd record the guest mixes from the Global DJ Broadcast, and host them on their site.  G&amp;D had a guest mix on July 6th, 2003, and it was one of the best mixes I had ever heard.  I was an instant fan.</p><p>I tried to find other stuff, and kept a look out for any new sets, but it wasn't as easy as it is today.  All of the music sharing communities were behind closed doors, and I really didn't have anything to offer in order to open them.  I just stuck to whatever showed up on djmixed2k.com.</p><p>They had two very solid tracks, As the Rush Comes and Beautiful Things.  Josh Gabriel is a technical wizard.  While other DJs were still running with Vinyl, and some using CDs, he was already embracing change beyond with Ableton.  Ableton is DJ software that can mix tracks on the fly. When Josh Gabriel took over the decks, all the track seamlessly melded together.  Tracks were mixed, remixed, and sampled to form a unique performance that was completely new at the time.  And backed by Dave Dresden amazing sense for track selection, their sets were always cohesive to the point it felt like a symphony.</p><div class='title'><b>Their Prime</b></div><p>2003 was an amazing year for Gabriel &amp; Dresden, and they continued to climb in 2004.  That's when I finally got the chance to see them.  They stopped by Vision, Chicago on Feb 28th, 2004. In fact, I had the opportunity to actually meet with them before the show through one of tranceaddict.com's meetups.  Their meetups had been very successful with Armin van Buuren, but when I arrived at the bar, there were only 5 of us.  Gabriel &amp; Dresden showed up, and we all had an awkward chat about random stuff.</p><p>Their performance was everything I had come to know them for. Harmonious and melodic trance that was way beyond what I was hearing from most other artists and DJs.  Hearing As the Rush Comes, Beautiful Things, and No one on Earth all live for the first time was a treat for me too.</p><p>Here are some pictures from that event: <a href="/old/v6/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago" title="/gabriel-dresden-vision-chicago">http://theschlock.com/club/040228/index.html</a></p><p>Later on in September, they finally made it to Minneapolis.  Pictures: <a href="/old/v6/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis" title="/gabriel-dresden-tabu-minneapolis">http://theschlock.com/club/040903_dresden/index.html</a></p><p>They continued to dominate throughout the year.  They released their first artist album and mix CD, and continued to pound out some amazing remixes, and performances.</p><p>Unfortunately, I started to loose track of them in 2005.  2005 was an awkward year as DJs made the inevitable transition from analog to digital.  Vinyl could not cut it any longer and it was either going to be CDs or Laptops going forward.  Also, during that time I was focusing on schoolwork and other hobbies which kept me at home in Platteville, rather than out in Chicago Saturday night.  I was still listening to their music downloaded from the Internet, but I wasn't actively seeking it out.</p><div class='title'><b>The Split</b></div><p>It wasn't until 2008 and 2009 that I returned to the dance music community, and actively starting following DJs again.  When I started looking up what Gabriel &amp; Dresden had been doing over the past years, they were no more.  In early 2008 they announced that they were breaking up, and at WMC 2008, they played their final performance at the Pawn Shop, the very spot that made them international acclaimed.</p><p>Their split makes sense though.  Even though they were a duo, they never played back to back.  It was always one than the other.  Dave wanted to play more housey "raise the roof" kinda tunes, while Josh wanted to actually build and blend a performance.</p><p>I went back through all the sets that I had missed, and none of them really had the same harmony as those original sets back in 2003.  There are some amazing gems in the bunch, though.  Their Banana Beach Bar set from Aug 14th, 2006 brings their later years very very close to their early years.  And their set from Guvernment, Toronto on Nov 16th, 2007 is an amazing mix of their later style.  I would say that it's the definitive Gabriel &amp; Dresden set of their later years.</p><p>Their final set from the Pawn Shop, WMC on Mar 28th, 2008 has been recorded, but it's not as tight or as expressive as the Guvernment set.  Maybe that's because all eyes were on them that day, and they went for technical greatness, rather than taking chances.</p><p>I don't really feel like I missed much having left them in 2005.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo</b></div><p>Unfortunately, I don't think they got the same acclaim running solo as they had hoped.  Dave Dresden and Josh Gabriel came through Chicago several times in 2009 and 2010.  And every time I saw they were coming, it didn't really register with me.  Even though when they were together on stage, their performances were separate.  I don't really know.  Together, they just had some kind of magic that blew everyone away.</p><div class='title'><b>Reunion</b></div><p>I think they figured this out as well, because in late 2010 they announced they would be taking the stage at the Hollywood Paladium together for New Years Eve.  Tickets sold out immediately, and the message boards went nuts.  It would have been amazing to be there in person.</p><p>They recorded part of their set and put it online, <a href="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-nye-2011" title="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-nye-2011">right here</a>.  I found it a little disappointing though.  The tracks didn't really compliment each other.  Most were just a bunch of other tracks that trance DJs were already playing.  It didn't have a unique sound at all, let alone did it sound like Gabriel &amp; Dresden.</p><p>"Well that sucks," I thought as I went back to listening to someone else.</p><p>But they were persistent.  A couple months later, they did another reunion show in DC, and again at Ultra Music Festival with Above &amp; Beyond.  I listened to their sets, and, again, it sounded no different than what other DJs were doing.  But the community was incredibly supportive.  G&amp;D signed on for a reunion tour, and now have basically announced that they have reunited for good.</p><p>I hadn't really been blown away by their reunion thus far, but when The Mid, Chicago announced G&amp;D were coming in July, I bought those tickets immediately.  I'm still a fan after all. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Reunited</b></div><p>This past weekend, they had 4 shows and 2 of them have showed up online.  Beta Nightclub on June 16th (<a href="http://www.tranceaddict.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=605277&forumid=6&s=" title="http://www.tranceaddict.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=605277&forumid=6&s=">info</a>) and Electric Daisy Carnival on June 18th (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-at-1" title="http://soundcloud.com/davedresden/gabriel-dresden-live-at-1">info</a>).  Both of these sets are very similar, and both sound pretty damn great.  After 6 months of being reunited, I think they've finally found their unique sound that sets them apart from everyone else.</p><p>Their melody, harmony, and catchy beats have returned, which makes me very very happy.  I can't wait to see them in July.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 23, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 14, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Super Potato Osaka</h3><p>One store that comes up often enough in the retro gaming community when talking about where to buy retro games in Japan is Super Potato.

There are castles which keep the original woodwork and layout since their construction. There are castles which have been completely gutted and had their insides completely replaced with a modern building turned into a full museum. And there is a combination of the two, where the interior hasn't been completely replaced, but it's been updated and some things moved around for ease of movement.</p><p>Throughout Japan, there are very few castle remaining in their original state. And I think the most common state of castles these days are the ones whose interior haven't been completely replaced, but changed slightly.
