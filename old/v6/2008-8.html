Last year, it really didn't feel all that crowded.  Sure there were tons of people, whose totals overcame 40,000, but I could still play stuff without waiting too long, and get into panels and main events I wanted to.</p><p>This year is huge.  After roaming around the exhibition hall, and going to some panels and movies, everything had some sort of line and a crowd.  We were unable to see Ken Levine's keynote and the inaugural Penny Arcade Q&A session of Friday because the room had been completed filled.  I don't think there were that many people last year that they refused entry.  Yet this year, the main event was moved in a larger room and was completely filled?  I'm sort of cringing at the amount of crowds we'll see today.  But I'm looking forward to playing a lot of game demos on Sunday.</p><div class='title'><b>Booths</b></div><p>Yesterday we spent a bunch of time overlooking all the booths and demos in the exhibition hall.</p><p>From Fallout 3...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1899.webp" /></p><p>To Deadspace...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1904.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1904.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1904.webp" /></p><p>To Onechanbara...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1906.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1906.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1906.webp" /></p><p>To Mirror's Edge to Left 4 Dead to Battlefield Heroes to Castle Crashers to Little Big Planet to Star Craft II to Wrath of the Lich King, to name a few.</p><p>Brawdo sports drink even had a booth.

I've found Waldo at a couple of places now.  Once at the Quest in Minneapolis, once at the <a href="/old/v6/barack-obama-in-madison" title="/barack-obama-in-madison">Obama Rally in Madison</a>, and now at PAX.  Waldo is getting easier to find.</p><div class='title'><b>Finishing off the night</b></div><p>After 1up Yours, Five, Jess and I caught up with Ace who had just finished his day of work and went to dinner.  We walked a few blocks to the nearby city mall, which had a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1927.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1927.webp">Daiso</a>!  Saw the movie, Second Skin in a video room.  And saw Jonathan Coulton, signing to a massive crowd in the dark.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/080829_pax/IMG_1929.webp" /></p><p>Jess worked one of the video rooms until the 3am closing time, so Five, Ace and I walked down to the Console Freeplay area and checked out a copy of Soul Caliber IV to keep us busy.  All the events and things during the day were pretty spectacular, but it's really the low key nature of just bull shitting around in a fighting game that really put a satisfying cap on the day.  It's was the same with playing DDR earlier, too.</p><p>I've really missed that social aspect of gaming since moving to Madison.  Most of the games I play have really all been single player experiences.  I'll get into games like Burnout Paradise for the online play, but I'm never playing with friends.  All the social aspects of a single player experience come from the aftermath for me.  After you've completed the game, and talk about it with people.</p><p>It was really great returning to that college atmosphere in the wee hours of the morning.  And Soul Caliber was the perfect vehicle.  I <a href="/old/v6/back-to-the-stage-of-history" title="/back-to-the-stage-of-history">wrote</a> about it a couple weeks, how Soul Caliber is really a window in the past for me with social gaming.  From playing with friends at Toys R Us, and getting to know people in college. It was the drug of choice, and playing it last night brought back all the fun warm fuzzy feelings.  ^_^</p><p>Also, Soul Caliber IV is fantastic and beautiful and I'm totally picking up a copy when I get back to Madison.  Even though I don't really have many people to play with, yet.  I think I'll introduce it some places and see how it goes.  Also, If those who do have the game play enough on their own, whenever we do get back together, we'll be on equal grounds.  (I'm looking at you Erika)<br/>___</p><p>So that's my Friday at PAX.  For the most part, I know what to expect today, so I won't be too disappointed if there's just too many people preventing me from seeing what I want.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on August 30, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">August 24, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Lost Via Domus</h3><p><i><b>Lost Via Domus Spoliers</b></i></p><p>You'd think a television show such as Lost would be above whoring itself out to sell a couple of bucks but here are.  I'm pretty sure ABC owns the actual rights to the Lost name, or else this game probably would not have been made.  But after spending the afternoon with Lost Via Domus on Xbox, starting at Noon and finishing around 5:30pm, I'm glad it was made.</p><p>Lost Via Domus is a pretty decently put together fan fiction spanning 7 episodes taking place during Seasons 1 and 2 of Lost.  Each episode lasts about 30 to 45 minutes and centers on main character, Elliot Maslow.  Elliot finds himself on the island with no memory of the past and a mysterious man out to kill him.  Inklings of his past start to trickle back to him, when Lost characters confront him about his past.  Elliot must piece together his past in flashbacks while using this information in the present to progress further.</p><p>The writers of Lost Via Domus have a very good grasp of Lost lore.  Each Lost character confronts and deals with Elliot and his problems in a very stereotypical way for their character.  Jack doesn't believe you.  Sawyer doesn't care.  Hurley's your buddy.  Locke leads Elliot through the woods to find himself.  Michael yells Walt a couple times.</p><p>Each episode is meant to take place during the storyline of Lost, but in time breaks it and then breaks it completely wide open.  In the beginning, I was completely with Elliot fitting into Lost.  His character was out of the real story and in his own.  But eventually, Elliot starts to do things that he shouldn't be doing.  Like opening and closing blast doors from inside the hatch.  And using dynamite to blow open a secret area of the Swan hatch and neutralize the magnetic reactor.</p><p>The story does not fit into Lost, but the themes and style are pretty well put together and are very Lost.  The themes of your past eventually confront yourself on the island, and you have the choice to diverge from those themes and learn from the past, or doom yourself to repeat it.</p><p>Aside from that, the environment and graphics are absolutely beautiful though.  If you've ever wanted to walk around on the set of Lost, all you need to do is pick up this game.  You walk around the beach, the Swan hatch, the Hydra station, the Flame station.  You can even find the mediical "Staff" station and "Pearl" station to walk around to, if you can find them.  Each setting is absolutely perfect in the game, and taking pictures of various Lost props gets you achievement points.</p><p>Overall, I think Lost Via Domus is a very unique gaming anomaly.  It's an interactive fan-fiction totally made by and for Lost fans.  As a Lost fan, I can respect this product and think it succeeds at its goals.  As a gamer, the game isn't really all that bad.  It's well put together, but very simple.  If this game had a story completely of its own, I would probably like it on its own and look forward to what the team was doing next.</p><p>But, even after all these kind words, I would recommend it as a <b>rental only for Lost fans</b>.  Once you finish it, that's it.  It's just 7 episodes of fan-fiction...  nothing more.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on August 24, 2008<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">August 24, 2008</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Choke</h3><p>This year has been fantastic for movies.  Cloverfield.  Speed Racer.  Dark Knight.  I just got back from my second viewing of Pineapple Express.  Fantastic!  Summer is winding down, though.  The air has become chill.  And all the kids are back in town for college.  The year is not quite over, but there's still one movie left that I eagerly anticipate.  That's <b>Choke</b>.</p><p>9 years ago, <b>Fight Club</b> introduced me to the satirical dark writing of Chuck Palahniuk.  Throughout those 9 years, I've read all his novels, watched Fight Club a billion times, and even seen him in person.  Fight Club made me an instant fan.  It brought my from cinema into novels and even fosters some creative writing from time to time.  I'd probably be playing video games on the bus if not for Fight Club, really.</p><p>Anywho, 9 years later, another of Chuck's books has finally made it to theaters.  Choke opens September 26th in select theaters, but some people have already seen it at various film festivals.  And from what it looks like, there are some haters out there.  The negative reviews seem to have a similar tone... 'It ain't Fight Club'.  Well, it's funny you should mention that...</p><p>Fight Club has a very distinct tone throughout the movie.  It's a very dark dank vision of society and the people around you.  Putting on a polite show for humanity, despite feeling completely empty and emotionless.  Then starting to break out of your shell just a little with growing confidence in yourself as a person.  This distinct thought process is beautifully translated from the book into film.  When I read the novel, I feel like I'm inside the main character's head.  The same way you are in most of the film.</p><p>After I read Fight Club, I went right on to the next book.  I read Survivor, Choke, Lullaby, Invisible Monsters, and Diary.  Each one carried this same tone.  Each novel placed you deep into the main character's thought process, feelings and emotions.  As I read each novel, I felt completely in tune with the main character.  Choke felt very much like Fight Club.  Only a different setting, different character background, different vices.</p><p>3 months ago, I saw Chuck Palahniuk in Minneapolis for the release of his recent novel, Snuff.  During the event, they played the trailer for Choke.  I was excited.  Even more excited than I had been from just being at the event to begin with.</p><p>However, after viewing the trailer, I felt very conflicted.  It was absolutely nothing like how I pictured it in my mind.  As you can see for yourself, the tone is completely comical.  poppy.  funny on the outside.  Complete opposite emotions I felt when reading the book.  Not Like Fight Club.</p><p>So, I watched the trailer and the red band trailer a bunch of times and went back to read the book.  I read the book from the mindset of a comedy movie.  Maybe I just read it wrong?  Perhaps Fight Club was pushing my expectations into the deep dark mood because the movie effected me in such a way.  Maybe this is a strictly comedic book.</p><p>Naw.  The timing is totally off in the book.  The focus is clearly the emotions and thinking of the main character, Victor Mancini.  The little one liner jokes in the trailer are completely moved around to make it a comedy.</p><p>But!  Then again, these are fricken trailers.  Trailers are created by production staff to promote the movie to as wide an audience as possible.  Thinking back to 9 years ago, I thought Fight Club was garbage from the TV spots I saw.  I only saw it later on DVD when my friends made me watch it.  The overall feeling of the book or movie can't be easily illustrated in a 3 minute clip.</p><p>I'm still totally stoked for Choke, though.  I think I'm going into the film with a unique perspective that I have never  had with any movie I've seen before.  I think this'll be the first movie where I've read the book way in advance from the film being announced.  It's exciting to see the movie adaptation clash with my imagination.  For some reason I imagined the characters a lot skinnier...  Especially Paige Marshall.</p><p>4 more weeks!</p><p>Check out both trailers on the <a href="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/" title="http://www.foxsearchlight.com/choke/">Official Site</a>.

class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Scanner Darkly</h3><p>Today is Sunday, but it's not a normal Sunday.</p><p>I'm on a couch.  No, not my own couch.  I don't even own a couch.  It's a friend's couch and I'm stayed at his apartment last night.  He and I aren't the only ones here either.  Many friends of ours came to visit him.  We went to the massive drinking party known as Irish fest.  As usual, I drank more than my share, but I had a great time.  Drinking and Dancing.  I remember pretty much all of it.  The only part that escapes me where my steps exiting the gates and arriving to the couch.</p><p>But, it's now Sunday.  A very hazy Sunday.</p><p>Waking up is always a chore when your body feels wrecked.  All of us in the room, feel the same, so I'm in equal company.  It puts me in a good mood.  A grand time experienced by us all.  Time is short, though.  My bus back to Madison is in a few hours.  And my ride to the bus time is even sooner.  I shower and pack and off we go.  My friend has a very busy day so he drops me off with a good hour before the bus arrives.  Luckily, there's a Perkins nearby.</p><p>Sunday is a very popular day.  It's the most popular day for Perkins.</p><p>With half an hour before noon, the Perkins is filled with after-Church goers.  Many seniors with their best set of clothes on their old bodies.  Many children in their best Sunday dress or slacks.  Families, both old and young.  And me.  Standing in the entrance-way holding a backpack full of worn clothes and shampoo.  Holding another bag with my computer and other personal belongings.  Alone.  With slightly damp untied hair down past my shoulders.</p><p>Table for one, please...   Jim.</p><p>To the inquisitive population my mouth moves and spews out those words.  My eyes wander to the table of grandmas nearest to me.  Then they dart back across the restaurant to the front counter to catch a name tag.  Kim.  Slowing moving across the assortment of pies and muffins under glass.  I am a bit hungry, but that's way too much sugar for the morning.  That muffin is larger than my fist.</p><p>Should be about a 15 minute wait.</p><p>I figured that would be obvious from the crowds of lightly colored dressed people.  I find a bench and set my things down.  There are three other groups of people waiting beside me in this green and black carpeted foyer area.  Two of these groups are a single couple.  Both young men taking their girlfriends or wives to an early afternoon meal.  The other group could be either couple in 10 or 15 years.  A middle aged father in jeans with a ratty shirt with a Beer logo on it.  A wife with a big blonde pony-tail, jeans and jean-jacket combo holding a generic baby carrier with two screaming children using their mom as an obstacle for whatever game they're playing.  I smile, but inside I can't stop laughing.</p><p>Jim?</p><p>15 minutes later, the half-dead elderly couple had thoroughly scrapped themselves out of a booth for me.  I feign sincerity as they pass by.  I lift up my belongings and follow Kim to a now lonely booth by the window.  Such a waste.  Isn't there a smaller table for just one person?  Am I really expected to fill this 4 person space?  I complain to myself, but say only thanks.  My bags take up all the room next to me.</p><p>Hi.</p><p>Quickly, A young short woman greets me.  She's incredibly perky for a Sunday morning.  Morning to me, anyways.  Hi, I reply.  She asks me if I want anything to drink.  Milk, I reply.  She asks me what size.  Large, I reply.  And what would you like to order today, She asks with a smile.  What's with all these questions.  So fast.  I hardly had anytime to look at the menu, let alone think a response.  Can I get a water too, I reply.  Sure thing, do you want a minute or two to look at the menu, She asks with a smile.  Yep, I reply.  And off she goes bouncing around with her blond pony tail swaying from side to side.</p><p>What <i>was</i> up with all those questions?  Do single patrons always know automatically what they wish to order?  Oh geez, I wonder what I was suppose to say...  Well, at least I can figure out what to order before she comes back.  I want an omelet of sorts.  Nothing else really looks as fine to me at this hour.  That's what I'll say when she returns.  And I'll practice it in my head a couple times so it doesn't sound weird.  Ugh, that's weird in of itself.</p><p>I bet that grandma over there think I'm weird.  Why is that gentlemen alone, she must wonder.  She probably asks herself a lot of useless questions like that.</p><p>The cheery waitress returns with my drinks and asks the question I've already answered in my head a couple times now.  I want an omelet of sorts.  What kind of sorts, she inquires.  One with tomatoes, mushrooms, veggies, and these two cheeses.  Splendid, she says with a smile.  You also get a muffin and some breakfast potatoes.  Splendid indeed.  And off she goes to put her scribblings up in the kitchen for the minimum wage chef.</p><p>I don't normally talk that way.  In fact, can I even be sure that really just happened?  Now I don't have anything to stare at with the menu gone.  Perhaps now is the best time to finally that book I've been reading.</p><p>Scanner Darkly</p><p>I've seen the movie before.  I've owned the movie for a while now.  And have watched it several times.  But the book is incredible.  Bob Arctor is truly beside himself in ways that the movie simply did not convey.  He is paranoid and a drug addict.  He feels he's doing the right thing by working for the police and spying on his friends.  His dark dank life is injected with a little good through himself.  But Bob Arctor is also Fred.  The undercover law enforcement officer spying on Bob Arctor and his friends.  What despicable lives they have.</p><p>Bob Arctor continuously takes Substance D as a stress reliver, recreational activity, and... well, just because it's there really.  He's addicted.  And the overuse of Substance D causes his brain to split.  The two hemispheres reveal conflicting information.  One side is Bob Arctor, the depressed drug addicted loser.  The other is Fred, the crappy undercover cop who's really wasting the government's time.</p><p>Reading the book reveals the full picture of Bob Arctor and his friends.  The movie is really just excerptse from the book.  Carefully chosen and edited scenes picture perfect from the text to paint a cohesive story that leaves several details out.  Details that didn't really matter to the story, but gave more insight to Bob Arctor and his growing paranoia.</p><p>I like this book a lot.  The whole 60s/70s lingo is fun too.</p><p>This is the first book written by Philip K Dick I've read, and I plan to continue read more.  But I get the feeling they won't live up to this one.  I'm not really a big fan of Sci Fi novels.  I think Sci Fi novels focus too much on the science fiction of the environment rather than the characters...  and so forth.  I love reading about the characters and what they're thinking during events.</p><p>Here ya go, sweetie.</p><p>Excellent.  Eggs, Veggies and little breakfast potatoes.  I consume them while getting closer to the ending.  The perfect meal for this Sunday.  I get my muffin to go and say Goodbye to the lovely waitress with a handsome tip.  The sun is slightly higher in the sky and I have 30 minutes before the bus arrives.  Through the window, I see the waitress bouncing around from one table to the next.  Across the street, I see my destination.  The bus stop.</p><p>Over the road and across the parking lot to the Goerke's Corner I go.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on August 19,

Xbox Arcade in which you play Tim.  The world is split up into 6 worlds in which you use Time as the main catalyst to advance and collect puzzle pieces.  The basic premise of the story is fairly standard at first.  Tim is looking for the princess, and with the completion of each world, is told the princess is in another castle.</p><p>On the surface that is all this game is.  Hopping, Skipping and Jumping.  Standard gameplay mechanics until you begin realizing your actions as the player.  You're killing endless amounts of these golems to achieve success.  To regain a puzzle piece piecing together a lost memory.  Once you've collected the pieces and assembled the puzzle, the memory is complete.  Yes, you have been here and these were your actions.</p><p>The next puzzle complete and the next puzzle complete.  You descend into madness searching for your lost princess.  Where is she?!  You are obsessed.  No one will stand in my way.  She is my princess and how dare you hide her from me.  Your senseless evil monsters will not win.  You can't win.  I am the true hero.</p><p>Thus it continues.  The senseless murder continues until it is complete.  You cannot find her in the present.  Your future is void without her.  The past is the key.  You've been using Time all along to find her.  It's time to go back to where it began.  That single night.</p><p>Backwards on that day with death following you.  When we worked together with the one goal of being reunited.  It was then when I finally reached your window and peered at you asleep that you screamed and ran.  I tried to catch up..  I tried to catch you.  And you tried to kill me.  You ran away.  But I will find you.  Nothing will come in my way.</p><p>There had to be something missing in all my memories.  Very hidden hints of something larger.  Those pesky stars in which I cheated to find.  With nearly all of them, I cannot only relive the event of that day, but change it slightly to obtain her.  And that is what I did.  And now all that is around me is on fire.  A smile crept onto my face.  But I had to ask myself, 'Is this what I thought happiness would be'?</p><p>____</p><p>Tim is a psycho.  The world that you control his actions appears like a cutesy little video game in Tim's eyes.

class="title">Back to the Stage of History</h3><p>Man, Soul Caliber really brings me back almost 9 years ago to the Dreamcast release of 9/9/99.  The first exposure I had with Soul Caliber was setting up all the playable Dreamcast kiosks in Toys R Us.  2 were setup with our pre-release copy of Sonic Adventure, and I setup a third with Soul Caliber because everyone in the store wanted to play it.</p><p>I turned on the TV and the Dreamcast, the little orange dot danced around the screen and painted the curly Dreamcast logo, and the opening cinema began.  The camera flying across the dusty ground with weapons piercing the land.  It was the most graphically impressive things I'd ever seen.  At that point, Final Fantasy VIII's cinemas were the best thing I'd seen, but those were all pre-rendered.  Soul Caliber was ALL real time and was much faster and shinier than those FFVIII cutscenes.</p><p>I instantly liked Soul Caliber, but I didn't fall in love until March the next year when I actually bought a Dreamcast and had my own copy of Soul Caliber.  I was pretty good at it. ^_^  I was able to completely trampled my casual-gaming friends and hold my own against my hardcore-gaming friends.  It was a head-to-head competitive game that everyone played and everyone had in common.  When visiting someone or them visiting me, Soul Caliber would also find itself into the visit.  Even later on, once I started college, we always came back to Soul Caliber.  It was a staple in fighting game nights.</p><p>I did go back to check out Soul Edge, but it didn't have the magic of Soul Caliber.  Soul Caliber was fast and had tons of Single Player modes.</p><p>I was super excited when Namco announced Soul Caliber II, and EVEN more ecstatic when Link was announced as a playable character!  I would look at <a xhref="http://www.the-magicbox.com/" title="http://www.the-magicbox.com/"The Magic Box</a> and <a xhref="http://watch.impress.co.jp/game/" title="http://watch.impress.co.jp/game/">Game Watch</a> every single day hoping for new information and whenever something came up, I would summarize the info on the SPAMM forum.  What characters were announced, which characters were returning, which were new.</p><p>In March 2003, I bought the import copy of Soul Caliber II on Gamecube.  I played it a bit, but no one really seemed to care.  It didn't have the caliber of the previous version since it was spread across all 3 consoles, Gamecube, Playstation 2 and Xbox.  People bickered which version was the true version.  People banned the console-specific characters because they were over-powered.  The Soul Caliber community no longer had the unity that brought them together in the beginning.</p><p>Soul Caliber III was lost in the fold for me.  It was only on Playstation 2, but it didn't have the arcade release to fine-tune the console release.  It was the first Soul Caliber to be released on a console ahead of the arcade game, and that just felt completely wrong to me.  It felt like an untuned, unrefined Soul Caliber game..  Not really the next step in the Soul Caliber series.  I've only played it once to this day, but I was happy that I could still hold my own with Kilik. ^_^</p><p><b>This week</b>, Soul Caliber IV comes to the next-gen Consoles with console-specific characters, once again.  I really didn't care about this at all, but after thinking back on my fond Soul Caliber memories.  I kinda want to get into it again.  Soul Caliber IV feels like a leap for the series into the HD era, so I kinda want to be a part of Soul Caliber again.</p><p>However, there's plenty of reasons that keep me from buying it.  First Off, which one do I buy?  I'd almost rather get the Playstation 3 game.  But, if any of my friends get it, they'll probably get the Xbox version and I wouldn't be able to play against them online.  Second Off, it's 60 friggen dollars.  Soul Caliber may have been my go to game in the past, but I doubt I'm going to play it more than 30 minutes without turning it off for something else.</p><p>The character creator sounds fun, but probably won't keep my interest.  I bought that Spore Creature Creator, but felt overwhelmed.  There was too much to do in there, and I couldn't get my creature to look like what I wanted.</p><p>Overall, Soul Caliber is my favorite fighting game of all time, but my history with it is in the past.  I dunno...  is anyone else going to buy Soul Caliber III on Playstation 3?</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on August 1,
