Gitaroo Man</h3><p>At the end of time and space, the Playstation is certainly known for the creation and flourishment of Rhythm games. All of Konami's Bemania games starting up with the Playstation hardware in mind, and other niche little title began to sprout up. Games like Parappa, Vib Ribbon, Gitaroo Man, Guitar Hero, Lumines, Every Extend Extra, and so forth. Even Sega's UGA branch found an excellent home for Rez and Space Channel 5.</p><p>This is probably my favorite genre in gaming because the idea of using music to fuse all parts of your experience together paints a glorious feeling. Its the only way to push your emotions to the absolute limits and tune everything else out. Honestly, I feel that music is the ultimate expression of yourself and being able to convey that message is pure nirvana.</p><p>Being able to experience other's feelings and thoughts is truly amazing. Other games like Fzero GX and Wipeout also convey this message through their amazing soundtrack.</p><p>But anyways, I spent a good chunk of my morning with my PSP which has really been the center of rhythm based games lately. As the title suggests, I played some Parappa and Gitaroo Man.</p><div class='title'><b>Parappa the Rappa</b></div><p>Parappa is one of the key soundtracks to the Playstation One's life. A month after its release, everyone was singing the songs together outside of the game. Even to this day, it's an amazing feeling to be in an elevator with one of the songs in your head and you accidentally mudder part of the song to yourself and then another elevator inhabitant sings it along with you ^_^</p><p>Back in reality, though.. Parappa the Rappa is about Parappa. A little dog kid who's trying to get the girl, but just needs confidence. Through 8 stages, you help Parappa rap to the confidence he needs to stand up to bullies, drive a car, bake a cake, make money, and so forth. Parappa's catch-line is "I gotta Believe". It's very cute and teaches kids to be confident in themselves and your dreams will come true ^_^</p><p>The game is pure excellence except for one very large unavoidable train wreck in basic gameplay that will stop this game in it's tracks.</p><div class='title'><b>The Timing</b></div><p>The quintessential element to every Rhythm game is so absolutely broken in Parappa, I don't think I'll be able to play the game again. Each level you have a partner you rap with and you simply copy their moves directly. There's a little time bar going across the top showing the buttons you need to press to go along with the song.</p><p>Except when you do exactly identical to the other person, you lose. You try to keep time with the time-line, you lose. I have no idea when I'm supposed to hit the button. It doesn't make any sense at all. And then when I go through a line and think that I completely biffed it, it works just fine! It sounds like crap but the game accepts it! What the hell!</p><div class='title'><b>Game Design Flaw</b></div><p>There's one other piece of game design that absolutely screws you over every single time, as well. In order to defeat a level, you have certain grading levels throughout the song. Cool, Good, Bad, and Awful. When you screw up a line, it'll flash the level below you indicating that if you mess up again, you'll go down a level. This continues until you screw up twice in a row on Awful. In order to pass a song, you must complete it in the Good and Cool status.</p><p>SO.. that means, regardless how you've done the entire song, if you screw up the last two songs.. YOU LOSE and you must begin the entire song again. The entire song can be easy as shit, but if the last two lines of the step chart are unique or really tough, you're screwed for passing the song. It's not possible, just give up. You can believe in yourself all you want, but the game hates you.</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict on Parappa</b></div><p>So screw Parappa.. I love the game a lot, and I don't remember the timing being so horribly broken. I mean, I beat the original back in the day.. somehow. I even remember getting Cool on the last level. When that occurs you simply freestyle by yourself with no grading and I had no idea how to do it.</p><p>Parappa had two sequels.. kinda. Um Jammer Lammy was a spiritual sequel with a guitar playing Lamb, and then the PS2 saw Parappa 2. I tried Um Jammer Lammy, but I absolutely hated it. Parappa was all about learning the songs you could sing to.. you can't do that with guitar :/</p><div class='title'><b>Gitaroo Man</b></div><p>Speaking of Guitars, Koei released this absolute gem on the Playstation 2 in between releases of Dynasty Warriors. It met with such bad sales over here, that it became instantly rare. When I finally learned of the game, copies were going for $80 on eBay. I thought all was lost, but Koei did us all a favor and re-released it. I snatched it up for $35 Used at Gamestop without a problem.</p><p>Gitaroo Man focuses on child U-1 and his life problems.. He loves this girl, but gets pushed around by bullies, does mediocre in school, and really has absolutely no talent. Little does he know, that he's actually the legendary Gitaroo Man and holds the power to rid the universe of the evil Gitaroos if he would only believe in himself and unlock his power.</p><p>The main premise is very similar to Parappa, except Gitaroo fights his opponents rather than learns from them.</p><p>When faced against opponents, U-1 grabs his Gitaroo and transforms into Gitaroo man.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>Gitaroo plays very wickedly. It does have a time-line, but it winds around the screen and you're to connect to it by pushing in the same direction. Notes come down the pipeline, and you hit and hold the O button to play them. You're always using one button when playing the song, but the time-line winds around the screen so much, it is still very interesting.</p><p>But that's not all. You're in a battle, and your opponent will fire attacks at you the same way. To dodge these attacks, you use the rest of the face buttons as the notes center mid-screen. It gets a little annoying because of trying to judge the correct order of button presses, but it's more challenging than difficult.</p><p>The timing is spot on.. You hit the button when the note hits the center of the screen. What a concept! How the hell can Parappa gets this so absolutely wrong?!.. ugh, whatever.</p><div class='title'><b>Innovation</b></div><p>With these two modes of play, Koei really mixes up the rotation. The main mode of gameplay is Charge (to regain health), Attack (which will deplete your health if you miss notes), and Finish (which is all attack, but you lose health if you miss notes). The first 5 or 6 levels are exactly like this, but Koei throws a little curve ball at you. One level you are running away from a space shark, which involves dodging the entire match. Just make it to the end!</p><p>My favorite level in the game is one where U-1 doesn't even transform into Gitaroo man, he doesn't even play his Gitaroo. With his recent battles, he's actually gotten pretty good at acoustic and plays a serenading song to ease the soul ^_^. Later on in the game, this serenade becomes your theme song, and you rock as Gitaroo Man to win over the hearts and souls of an entire planet. It's quite moving ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Verdict on Gitaroo Man</b></div><p>Koei sets up its gameplay, but doesn't rigidly stick to it either.. They play around with it and compose an excellent game. The sound fills you with compassion and you become U-1 and battle the evil Gitaroos for control of their Gitaroo.</p><p>I fully recommend this game, and if you own a PSP, you must own it. Definitely pick it up before it becomes rare again.. I picked up my copy a few weekends ago at Gamestop for $18.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Versions</b></div><p>Unfortunately, the PSP version of Gitaroo is exactly identical. They didn't add any remixes or new levels, which is an absolute downer.</p><p>Parappa actually defeats Gitaroo Man in the category. You can go on the PSN with Parappa and download new remixes of all the stages, but that's really it. They should have included Parappa 2 in this PSP game, and maybe even Um Jammer Lammy. It would've been excellent to have the Parappa trilogy all in one pack. Oh well...</p><div class='title'><b>Length and Replay value</b></div><p>Unfortunately, both games suffer from extremely short game time. That comes with the territory though :/. Rhythm games, such as these, are short because each stage is the length of a song.. about 5 to 10 minutes. Each song takes time to craft and compose, so it stands that you'll have no more than a hand full of levels.</p><p>Parappa has 8 stages and Gitaroo man has 11. I just started Gitaroo Man this morning, and after an hour and a half, I'm at the final level. With those remixes, Parappa has an extended life time, but Gitaroo Man does not. Sure, you can go back and get perfect grades on levels, but it's nothing you hadn't seen before.</p><p>I think both games have multiplayer. Gitaroo Man has always had multiplayer, but I think they tacked it on for Parappa PSP. That might be kinda fun..</p><div class='title'><b>To recap</b></div><p>Gitaroo Man is an excellent addition in the Rhythm genre, and you'd be a fool to pass it up. Parappa on the other hand with get sales because of the nostalgia, but shitty gameplay completely ruins this game.. you'd be a fool to buy it, especially at full price.</p><p>Though, I find it ironic that I still hum Parappa songs before I'd ever hum a Gitaroo Man song. I guess replaying the damn level over and over and over again really puts that song into your head. ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 30, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 28, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">PSP Sales</h3><p>It seems like everyone is picking up one of those new PSP Slims.  I got mine <a href="/old/v6/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming" title="/ffvii-crisis-core-psp-current-gaming">a week and a half ago</a>, and yesterday Tony ordered <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org/?p=229" title="http://blog.t-kun.org/?p=229">one of his own</a>. ^_^.  But, it looks like we're not the only ones.</p><p>Last week, marked the first week the PSP has beaten the DS in a long time, if not ever.  But not only did the PSP beat the DS, it beat out all other consoles.  and NOT only did it just beat out of the other consoles, but it fricken creamed them by nearly 4 fold.</p><p>The PSP generated sales in the 277,000 with the PSP Slims debut week.  The week prior, the FFVII PSP sold around 75,000 of its 77,777 units.  I guess with the release of FFVII Crisis Core, sales are booming.  They've finally got their system seller.  <em>source: <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/only-in-japan/simple-2000-the-japanese-hardware-chart-304681.php" title="http://kotaku.com/gaming/only-in-japan/simple-2000-the-japanese-hardware-chart-304681.php">kotaku</a></em></p><div class='title'><b>Domestic Releases</b></div><p>Well that's good for Japan, but the PSP is looking very bright fot the month of October here in the states.</p><p>On October 9th, <b>Final Fantasy Tactics Lions War</b> is released which is a port/remake of the original Playstation One title.</p><p>On October 23rd, <b>Castlevania Dracula X Chronicles</b> is released which is also a port/remake of Rondo no Blood on the MSX.  This also contains a port of Symphony of the Night.</p><p>These two titles are huge and will definitely bring more people into the PSP area..  In fact, I'm sure these are the two biggest, if not only, reasons Tony finally got a PSP of his own ^_^.  These are, like, his two favorite games of all time.</p><p>Also in the month of October, <b>Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops Plus</b> is released..  This is an expansion Disc for the original MGSPO, and I think it requires it too.</p><div class='title'><b>PSP Life is good</b></div><p>With Final Fantasy Tactics, Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid and Final Fantasy VII, the PSP is starting to look VERY VERY nice, and has ample amounts of niche puzzle and rhythm titles too.</p><p>That said, I find it ironic that I haven't played my PSP for more than an hour at a time every since I got it.  Of course, I've only been playing those niche puzzle and rhythm games I own.  Once Halo 3 winds down, I plan on starting Metal Gear Solid, so that'll rack up PSP time.  Hopefully, I'll finish that up before Castlevania comes out. ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 28, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 27, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Brain Age 2 + Rainbow Styli</h3><p>I love days when I receive packages..  like today for instance.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070927_brainage/100_0512b.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070927_brainage/100_0512b.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070927_brainage/100_0512b.webp" /></p><p>Today, I got a package from Nintendo, which contained a set of Rainbow Styli for use with the Nintendo DS.

Typing up messages through AIM was simply too slow, and, unfortunately, I could not find Gage's headset anywhere.. even after tearing apart that closet.</p><p>So, I ran out to stores real quick and picked up the Halo 3 Limited Edition Wireless Headset.. Oohhh..  It comes with everything you see here:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0510.webp" /><br/>Yeah, that's it.  Just the headset and the recharging cord, all for the high ticket price of $60.  This was also the same price as the non-Halo 3 headset.  I decided to go with the Halo 3 one because its subtle Halo 3 design wasn't blatant or as ugly as those Halo 3 controllers.</p><div class='title'><b>Way too expensive</b></div><p>Obviously, the big problem with this thing is the price.  The regular wired headset is only $20, and just recently Microsoft released an official Messenger kit, which comes with a mini-keyboard you can hook into your controller, and also comes with a wired headset.  That little pack costs $30.</p><p>I coulda shoulda woulda picked up one of those two products, except I went to Shopko, rather than Best Buy, Gamestop, and another store that probably would have had a bigger selection.  So my choices were a $60 normal set, or a $60 limited edition set.  I really just wanted to get back, rather than spend an hour shopping around, so I pushed aside my cheap ass nature, and bit the bullet.</p><p>It's probably difficult to manufacture, but this thing should really be $40.  Especially when you have the headset and messenger kits far cheaper.</p><div class='title'><b>How it works</b></div><p>This little thing is actually pretty slick.  Once fully charged, you sync up the headset to the 360 like you would with a wireless controller.  Once your 360 is on, hit the synchronize button, and then hit the synchronize button on the headset.  It'll connect to your 360 and link up with the first available player.  You can hit the sync button to cycle through which player the headset is for.</p><p>Unfortunately, that means I bought a $60 headset that is proprietary to the Xbox 360 and can't be used for any other devices.  It's not a blue-tooth headset, so that means, I can't use it on my phone, I can't use it on my computer, and I can't use it on a PS3 (whenever I get one).  That's definitely one advantage the PS3 has over the 360.  Use of non-proprietary products all around.</p><p>If I want a wireless headset for all these devices of mine, I'll need to drop another bit of cash for one.</p><p>Annoying.</p><p>I'm pretty sure you could use any regular wired headset with the 360 controller and  I don't think those are proprietary.</p><div class='title'><b>Crystal Clear</b></div><p>Despite it's cost, It works incredibly well, for the few hours I was using it yesterday.  It didn't pinch my ear and  I could easily and clearly hear Justin on the other end, and he said his end was just the same.  I don't know if I had the sensitivity too high, but he could hear other things going on in the background too.

My main goal was to meet up with Justin and play through some Campaign levels.</p><p>So far, my experience with Halo 3 has been nearly identical to my experience with Halo 2..  Exactly the same gameplay as the previous titles, with very subtle graphic improvements.  It's really funny how identical the graphics are.  I mean, the textures are far more detailed, but the models looks the same, the animations look the same.</p><p>Of course, I'm several months late into this news.  Everyone else already experienced and bitched about it when the Beta began.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>Halo 3 takes up right after the end of the Halo 2.  Master Chief finally lands after destroying another Halo, and Cortana is still missing in the hands of the enemy.  Another prophet is hell bent on exterminating humanity, and descends on earth.  You begin your assault against this prophet to protect humanity...</p><p>Something like that anyways...  Despite playing through Halo 1 and 2, I really never paid attention to the story.  The actual story portreyed in those games seemed like running from battle to battle.  The action is what really drove the game, and all the back story and plot fell behind for me.</p><p>That.. and I never cared for Halo at all, so I didn't care to pay attention.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Co-op</b></div><p>Well, today is a brand-new day, and once Justin and I got into the same lobby online, we were off into the single player.  Unfortunately, Co-op campaign was just a little bit laggy for me to really get into it.  It wasn't terribly laggy, but just enough for me to notice.  Running side-by-side with Justin was quite entertaining.</p><p>We only played a little bit, since staying up all night to buy the game really didn't give us time to sleep.  After he took off, I played a bit of Solo.</p><div class='title'><b>Solo Player</b></div><p>Solo I found more legible to play.  I actually knew what was going on, and could find my way around without too much trouble.  I could also stop and look at the environment without getting left behind by Justin.. heh.</p><p>Halo 3's beginning is very parallel to the beginning of Halo 2, but without the whole cheesy special effects space battle at the beginning which was quite entertaining.  I love being back on earth, but I haven't gotten to any cities or urban areas yet..</p><p>One thing I did love about Halo 2 was seeing the metropolis off in the distance, gradually traveling closer, and eventually fighting the covenant inside the city..  fighting in buildings, driving warhogs through the streets..  You actually got to battle the aliens on our home turf and showed them we meant business.</p><p>In Halo 3, I'm still on earth, and they're still plenty of aliens to ward away, so hopefully we'll get into urban environments..  then again, it probably doesn't want to copy Gears of Wars too much.</p><div class='title'><b>Multiplayer</b></div><p>I didn't want to get too far in the campaign mode without Justin, so I went over to Multiplayer in full expectations of getting my ass kicked and I wasn't disappointed.  I didn't get completely killed, though.  I was able to pull off a couple wins and gain a few ranks</p><p>Halo 3's leveling system is kinda neat.  You get so much Experience points for your placement in ranked matches, which will determine who you are matched up against to battle.  The matchmaker service does everything for you, and it took me NO time to get into a room and start fighting people.  MUCH MUCH better than Lost Planet, which took me 30 minutes to find a decent room on my own, and then be "matched" up against top-level people when I was just beginning.</p><p>Levels are kinda screwy at the moment since everyone is just starting out, but by next week or the week after, the top-players will really start to distance themselves for the mediocre players, and games should be quite balanced.</p><div class='title'><b>Online Statistical Tracking</b></div><p>Bungie keeps track off ALL Xbox Live ranked matches and will update all your stats online with much more detail than what the game will tell you.</p><p>Here are my awesome stats: <a href="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock" title="http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock">http://www.bungie.net/Stats/Halo3/RankHistory.aspx?player=DyreSchlock</a></p><p>Whooo...  At the time of this writing, they aren't exactly up to the minute.  I think I'm a private now, after 6 or 7 matches.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Halo 3 is pretty fun so far..  I think its hilarious how Microsoft is marketing this as the biggest multimedia seller of all time, but, as Tony had pointed out, it's not as big as Harry Potter.</p><p>Also, I'm a mere 3 chapters into the story of the game, and there are supposedly a total of 9 chapters..  short, much?<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 25, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 25, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Halo 3 Midnight Release</h3><p>This evening marks the release of one of the most anticipated games of all time, Halo 3.  It's a strike for western gaming in the console market.  When Microsoft began treading into Console territory, would anyone had guessed that their IP would be the number one best selling pre-order of all time?</p><p>To mark this event further, Best Buy announced several midnight releases at their stores throughout the country.. One of these stores just happened to be a few blocks away from my house, here in Madison ^_^.</p><p>After watching the season premiere of Heroes, Tony graciously joined me in line in front of Best Buy.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070924_halo/100_0487.webp" /></p><p>At 9pm, the line really wasn't all that long at all.  Tony and I parked at the end and played some Pacman Vs. on DS.  I was actually surprised that one other person in line actually had a DS, but I wasn't so surprised that most of the other avid Xboxers were tossing around a football and yelling obscenities at each other as loud as they could.  It also didn't surprise me when one of their friends drove on by with Rap music blasting out of their car speakers.</p><p>2 hours went by pretty quickly. After Tony beat me 3 out of 5 matches in Pacman, I tried to write up my Phoenix Wright article but got distracted really easy by Wikipedia and other various pieces of information on the internet.  Apparently Wisconsin has a state fossil..  it's a trilobite.  Minnesota, on the other hand, does not have a state fossil -_-;;</p><p>At 11 o'clock, one of the managers came outside with blue tickets for the Halo 3 inflatable chairs..  It just so happens that Tony and I were at the dead end of receiving the tickets. ^_^.  Hot damn..  Waiting 3 hours in line was just the trick to getting 1 of 25 chairs.</p><p>But these chairs were only given to those who purchased the game, so Tony was 1-up on the other people ahead of us in line who missed their opportunity to grab a ticket.

I really needed to get up to UW-Eau Claire and retrieve my bowling ball, which was in my little brother's possession, and while together, we decided to go the extra couple of driving hours to reach Minneapolis.</p><p>Today on the way, we stopped off in downtown Minneapolis and took a look at something I didn't get around to doing when I was home last time.  I think that was around 2 months ago.</p><p>We took a look at what was left of the 35W bridge that had collapsed into the Mississippi River on that July Thursday evening around 6pm.</p><p>Parallel to the 35W bridge is another bridge about 200 feet away that connects part of the yuppie downtown area to dinkeyville and the UofM on the other side of the river.  We ended up parking a block or two away from the north foot of that bridge in the fraternity sector of campus and begin to make our way south along the bridge overlooking the disaster.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0464.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0466.webp" /></p><p>Here's the northern foot of 35W, collapsed into a train yard.  Those two train cars were udderly crushed from the weight of the bridge and its rush hour inhabitants.  Here's a closeup:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070923_35w/100_0467.webp" /></p><p>There were two very large chunks of the bridge still left for disposal.  The closest chunk used to lay atop one of the shelves at the base of the river.  When I first saw this chunk, i thought, "jesus.. no wonder this crappy bridge feel apart."  Honestly, that bridge has got to be the most brittle construction job ever done.</p><p>It looks like 35W was nothing but a thin slap of concrete stretching all the way across the Mississippi being held up by a couple steel beems balancing on 3 or 4 raised shelves.  This bridge should've been torn down years ago and replaced..

You can read all about it on their website: <a href="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html" title="http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html">http://poi.apache.org/hssf/index.html</a>.  It does everything I nearly want to do, except one crucial part of today's task, which is cell validation.  You can setup Excel to "validate" a cell by restricting what values can be entered.  One such method is providing a list of values, and the cell will act like a dropdown menu.</p><p>Heartbroken that I couldn't use POI to generate my Excel document, I setup my code to read in an Excel document formatted exactly how I wanted and use POI to modify the current document with the list values I want.  In Excel, list values can be designated with a Name.  In order to name a list, select the cells you wish to use and then enter a name for them.</p><p>When I attempt to do this action using POI, the names are looking in radically different places than what I specified.  I still haven't quite figured out why, but after digging down deep in the object models of POI, I've learned some interesting design choices by the developers.</p><div class='title'><b>Layered Design</b></div><p>POI seems to have two object layers in its API.  There's a very low level object model that is very machine.  The objects and values at the bottom are somewhat difficult to decipher, as they describe each individual part of the excel document in a very programmatic way.</p><p>The upper layer is a very easy to understand set of objects.  If I want to make a cell, I only need to call one method that will set everything up me, rather than create an object and set all the necessary trivial data for Excel to read.  This one method will do all that for me.</p><p>Hurrah for school, I've actually used this design a couple times before both in School and Work.  This middle-man layer is known as the <b>Policy Layer</b>.  It's main purpose is to create a bridge between low level details and the user.  It separates your program or API into two chunks.  One chunk being a code representation of the machine code you're operating on.  One chunk being a very easy to use API that operates on the low level objects so the User doesn't have to.</p><p>This type of design is used much more with GUI design, where your program is the low level chunk, and all the GUI code is the upper level chunk.  Because the GUI code and operational code are completely separate, it makes switching out and refactoring the GUI much much easier.</p><p>Actually, I suppose that's the same with all object packages.  I mean, a package is nothing more than a jar of code someone else designed, tested, and published to help out other people with the same problems.</p><div class='title'><b>Shelled Layers</b></div><p>Well that's fine, except for my error I mentioned earlier.  The policy layer of POI is screwing up my Excel document underneath, and unlike a good Policy and operation layer setup..  the Policy layer is completely obstructing my view of the operation layer.</p><p>I know exactly what low level stuff I need to change, but all the Policy objects have no getters, no setters, and no way of getting to it.  The Policy layer acts as a shell with very little holes to exploit.</p><p>Policy layers should never get in the way of what people want to do, and this fails one of the golden rules of software design which is putting the User in control.  Sure you don't want to confuse your User, and you certainly want to keep them from screwing up everything..  But you are also shutting out the Users that actually know what they're doing.</p><p>Fricken annoying...  though, who knows..  I'll check it out again tomorrow and see if I missed something.. otherwise I may need to hack apart the library a little bit to get what I want.</p><div class='title'><b>Acronyms</b></div><p>I also find it really odd that through all this documentation and code, I still have no idea what the hell POI or HSSF stands for..  honestly, I really couldn't even guess what it stands for either.</p><p>So, I looked it up on wikipedia..  POI stands for Poor Obfuscation Implementation, and HSSF stands for Horrible SpreadSheet Format.  Nice!</p><p>POI would be the Policy layer in this case, and HSSF being the low level operation layer.  I don't think their implementation is that bad, but if I need to override classes and play around a little bit with reflection, then it is aptly named, my friend.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 20, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 19, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">FFVII Crisis Core PSP &amp; Current Gaming</h3><p>So today I got a long-awaited package..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0437.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0437.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0437.webp" /></p><p>Pure proof, that I can spend way too much of video games..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0439.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0439.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0439.webp" /></p><p>It's the <b>Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core Limited Edition PSP</b> celebrating the release of Final Fantasy VII on the PSP.

Currently, I'm in the middle of 2 games: Oblivion and Phoenix Wright 3.  Since starting Oblivion, I haven't touched Phoenix Wright 3, which is making things difficult.  I want to finish up Phoenix Wright 3 and get it out of the way before Halo 3 comes out next week, but I also want to enjoy Phoenix Wright 3..  I find it somewhat annoying that I'm putting so much emotion stock into Halo 3.....</p><p>Phoenix Wright 3 is a bit better than its previous game, but it's just as boring..  I really only want to progress through the game to the full grasp of story and finish off that series.  I think this weekend, I'm really going to have to power through it, and write my peace on it.</p><p>Getting into Oblivion wasn't the greatest idea either...  I figured that I would just play it for a couple hours and then stop cold turkey because of how crappy it is.. but unfortunately, it is actually better than I thought, and I'm having fun with it ^_^.</p><p>On top of these two games, I want to give Final Fantasy VII a go, and have been waiting to play Metal Gear Solid Portable Ops.. but maybe they'll have to wait.  There's a slew of other PSPs games I also want to start playing, too.  Check out my PSP shelf..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070919_psp/100_0447.webp" /></p><p>Not bad, huh?  All these games were purchased between $10 and $15, too.  See.. I can still be a cheap ass when the opportunity arises.  There's still a couple PSP games out there that need to drop in price..  like Parappa, Crush, and Innocent Life.</p><p>I'm going to stick to my 2-game policy to prevent myself from burning out.  I must beat Phoenix Wright over the weekend to make way for Halo 3 on Tuesday.  I think when I'm waiting in line for Halo 3, i'll probably play a little more Brain Age 2.</p><p>Anyways, feel free to complain about how much I spend on video games in the comment section. ^_^  I'm going back to Oblivion.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 19, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 19, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Sasha @ Avalon Los Angeles 24/06/06</h3><p>A couple weeks ago when surfing around on the internet, I found myself on djsasha.com, home to my favorite dj, Sasha.  The last I came across of sasha was back when his CD fundacion was released about 2 years ago.  I figured that he must've been up to something since then.</p><p>Well, he's not touring around, but he did release a CD between now and then.  That would be the title of this article, Sasha @ Avalon so on and so forth.  I wasn't that big a fan of fundacion but Airdrawndagger and Involver are two of my favorite CDs, so i'll give it a chance.</p><div class='title'><b>Limited Edition</b></div><p>No Luck, actually.  This CD is limited to a mere 10,000 copies, and when I searched for it on Amazon, Ebay and Half.com, the cheapest discs were going for $100.  I love Sasha, but with his current trend of music, there was no way I was going to put down that amount of cash for a CD.</p><p>Thank god for Google.  I checked to see where I could find this disc for the cheapest.  A couple places had it for $15 and $20.  Really?!  Oh wait, they're out of stock.  I continued to wade through these cheap out of stock copies, when I came across two sites that said they actually had it in stock..  walmart.com and Bull Moose audio.</p><p>No way.. they probably just forgot to update their inventories.  That didn't stop me though..  at $20 with a possibility of being in stock, why not just order it?  The least that could happen would be your order canceled and money returned.  So I went for it..  I ordered one copy from Walmart, and another from Bull Moose.</p><p>Success!  Both of my orders were processed, shipped, and received!</p><div class='title'><b>Presentation</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/100_0322.webp" /></p><p>The packaging is pretty badass..

Very progressive compared to his previous styles of Involver and pre-Involver.  Sasha's motive for music is to build upon many different layers of sound, which he's been systematic putting into his style ever since learning Abelton Live and going completely digital.</p><p>I don't get his new style, though.  He builds tons of layers, but all the layers eventually blend into each other, with no defintion of melody or sound.  It all sounds the exact same to me and very stands out what-so-ever.  When I listen to his new style, I completely forget I'm even listening to the music.  Later on, I'll check the playlist and realize I've gone through 5 or 6 songs already..  sigh.</p><p>Avalon is quite similar to this style but does break away into melody and definition in a few spots.  The first disc has a couple tracks that are wonderful..  Unlike all the fundacion tracks, I actually start humming them thinking back to the cd. ^_^</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't enough of these tracks that make me love this cd as a whole.  These tracks are quite soothing, but don't bring the painting into a full composition.</p><p>Not only that, but he suffers a train wreck in the first track of the second cd.  What the hell is up with that?  The only reason this cd is so expensive is because of its rarity..  This is definitely one to download, rather than purchase.</p><p>Here's my thoughts on each individual track:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070911_sasha/playlist.webp" /><br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 19, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 18, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Salmon Fried Rice</h3><p>Greetings, everyone.

The hint of butter.. the hint of soy sauce.. all wrapped around the superb taste of the divine fish.</p><p>This recipe is extremely basic, but the taste of extraordinary..  Of course, it's the salmon that brings this fantastic taste to the table in the first place.  Unfortunately, it is a very basic bi-product of the salmon, so it's difficult to focus this as the center of your dinner.  Some green beans on the side would act as a brilliant compliment to this outstanding meal.</p><p>Give it a try if you have some $50 fish sitting around the house ^_^.</p><p><em>PS: The images might not show up in an RSS reader because I turned off hot-linking from my site.

Then that teammate drives around the track and does the same for several laps.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0345.webp" /></p><p>There was the 360 race, where each car had to spin 360 degrees around the finish lap for the lap to count</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070915_demoderby/100_0365.webp" /></p><p>Then they began to change up the course a little bit, using the the little 'pit' area near the finish line.

A movie that can be engaging, can be captivating, and overall you emotionally invest yourself in from the start.  Whether, you love the characters, love the environment, love the music or any other part of it, you are brought into the world with such force that you tune out everything else.  This movie (or game) becomes part of you.</p><p>With such beauty it brings itself to the absolute climax and you are there riding along side it..  You are there with the characters, with the scene as it unfolds.  and BAM.. it hits you.  That feeling of absolute beauty.  So much beauty fills you.. overflows through you..  so much so, that can't help but shed a tear.</p><p>Pure Happiness ^_^</p><p>That's how I feel every time I watch <b>Princess Mononoke</b>.  That's how I feel when Ashitaka and San return the head to the Dear God, he revives himself, and then falls to his death..  At that split moment, when all the destruction, all the hate, and all the war is whisked away into the air..  The peaceful, raped, and bare land lays still..  until the buds of life begin to grow.  The brown scorched hills begin to breathe green from its soil, as the piano solo starts..</p><p>:sniff:..  it's so beautiful..</p><p>It's hard to hold back your emotions when you realize that life does move on..  With all the sadness, anger, and horror, life will always prevail.</p><p>Oddly enough, wasn't it a decade ago when it first came out in theaters?  :looks it up: .. nope, I'm wrong.  It came out in October 1999 in US theaters.  Heh, that was a good movie date..  I went with both Michelle and Lindsey (co-workers at Toys R Us) to Plymouth Manns theater the day it came out.  However, it did release in Japanese theaters in July of 1997.</p><p>Hopefully, whomever holds the North American rights will release a Blu-ray version of Mononoke in the near future.</p><p>Anyways, aside from <b>Princess Mononoke</b>, there is one other movie that captivates me with so much emotion..  and that is <b>Garden State</b>.  I should really buy myself a copy of that movie.  That's the one with Zach Braff and Natalie Portman.  I think there may have been others, but i cannot recall.</p><p>Excellent movies..<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 15, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 13, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Rock Band US Tour</h3><p>As part of the Rock Band release this holiday season, MTV is rolling trucks around the US promoting the Rock Band atmosphere of the game up on stages.  Rock Band, by the way, is a rhythm game by Harmonix, the creators of Guitar Hero.  Rock Band has 4 "instruments": Lead Guitar, Bass, Drums and Vocals.  Form your own video game Rock Band this christmas season!</p><p>Rock Band seems like it'd be pretty fun in the atmosphere they are presented with this stage and crowds.  You really get to live out your fantasy as a rock legend with your Guitar Hero skills.  However, I don't really see THAT atmosphere transferring to the home what-so-ever.  How is playing with 4 people in the same room with a crowd of a couple people compare against playing by yourself with 3 other friends online?  It can't compare at all.</p><p>Rock Band is a purely social game that can only be played with a dozen people.</p><div class='title'><b>Rock Band Tour hits Milwaukee</b></div><p>Anyways, back on topic..  The Rock Band Tour just kicked off this week, and one of their first destinations was Milwaukee.  These tour dates can be found on Rock Band's website: <a href="http://rockband.com" title="http://rockband.com">http://rockband.com</a>.  The tour dates for Milwaukee are incredibly vague though..</p><p>Thu 9/13 - UW-Milwaukee Campus - TBA<br/>Fri 9/14 - TBA<br/>Sat 9/15 - Best Buy - Location TBA<br/>Sun 9/16 - Best Buy - Location TBA</p><p>O_o..  Way to organize yourself MTV.  With no indication of time or exact place, I decided to make a day of it anyways and got Tony to come with me ^_^.  I called up Jin, a former UW-Platteville student, now UW-Milwaukee student, if he had any more information, and also if he wanted to join us.</p><p>Jin had no idea what I was talking about, "No.. I haven't seen anything around campus advertising it or anything indicating anything at all."  Hmm...</p><p>While at work today, he gave me a phone call to say that he knew someone that had spotted the Rock Band truck on campus, back in the Klotche Center parking lot.  Huzzah!  Information..  It pays to know people all over the place ^_^.   With the location in hand, and the road ahead.. Tony and I left Madison around 4.30p and took off to UW-Milwaukee to check out the Rock Band Tour.</p><div class='title'><b>UW-Milwaukee</b></div><p>Getting to UW-Milwaukee wasn't too bad..  I missed one turn that cost us about 10 minutes, and then finding a parking spot took another 10 minutes.  We got to the Klotzche Center to notice the Rock Band Truck!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/rockbandtour.webp" /></p><p>The truck was all locked up though, and the canvas was pulled down..  They were certainly closed, but it seemed ready to open at some point.  I figured they were going to do a night event with fog lamps, lasers..  the whole works!  "Well...  let's go find something to eat and then come back.. maybe they'll be open then."</p><p>Tony and I walked across the Milwaukee campus to find some food.  The whole UW-Milwaukee campus is very cramped together, stuck on 3 main blocks in northern Milwaukee..  like 5 minutes north of downtown Milwaukee.  It has all the college buildings stuck together on a block, and all the residence halls stuck together on a block..  So much college in such a little space, gave me a really weird feeling..  it didn't really feel like an actual University to me.  :shrugs:</p><p>Anyways, after dinner, I gave Jin a call to ask him what he was up to and what his plans were.</p><div class='title'><b>Disappointment</b></div><p>Apparently, the Rock Band thing was going on all day and actually ended around 4 or 5pm..  So we missed it.</p><p>There was so many things wrong with their whole setup in the first place, though.  As Jin pointed out to me, There was absolutely no advertising for this events AT ALL.  It was basically word of mouth which didn't work.  In addition, the Klotzche Center parking was on the far edge of campus behind the building in a parking lot only fit about 20 cars..  as you can see from the photo above.</p><p>Also, according to Jin, all the "roadies" MTV hired to help out with setup and, perhaps, advertising, were mainly hired from madison.  These people got totally trashed the night before hand, and simply stiffed the morning crew.  They didn't even show up, so the few people left had a very rocky morning having the setup everything themselves.</p><p>As these failing factors resulted in poor turnout and an overall failure of the event.  I suppose if they had their act together they probably would have still been open by the time Tony and I arrived.</p><p>Booooooooo.</p><p>Well, i'm sure they'll have far better results when setting up for a Best Buy store..  They'll have paid employees to give a hand..  Plus, as Tony mentioned, Best Buy's will probably have their own Rock Band setup close to launch time, so they'll be plenty of chances to play the game with a crowd nearby and not having to purchase the game.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 13, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 12, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Treasure remaking itself</h3><p>Today's featured news item comes from 1up, which seems to be the only video game news site that really hunts down today's new with the retro in mind.</p><p><a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162744" title="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162744">http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3162744</a></p><p>Kickass Japanese Developer <b>Treasure</b> has announced this week that their next game will be yet another remake of one of their classics.  This third remake will be of <b>Bangai-O</b> originally released on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast.</p><div class='title'><b>Guardian Heroes</b></div><p>3 years ago, Treasure remade their classic Guardian Heroes on the Gameboy Advance.  Guardian Heroes was originally released on the Sega Saturn back in 1996.</p><p>Guardian Heroes is considered the benchmark for the beat-em-up genre, featuring a pure blend of leveling, brawling, and balance between all playable characters, much like Golden Axe and Gauntlet.  Something that Guardian Heroes really expanding on move-sets, so it had all the moves of a fighter, but was a 5 or 6 player co-op brawler.</p><p>There really hasn't been any game since then to top the this wonderfully designed arcade style classic.</p><p>In 2004, <b>Advance Guardian Heroes</b> was released with very disappointing results.  I've never played it, nor owned it, but I have seen it around for pretty cheap, so perhaps I'll pick it up at some point.</p><p>The US version of Guardian Heroes fetches a pretty hefty price on ebay these days.  Luckily, I was able to snag a Japanese copy for about $26 while studying abroad. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Gunstar Heroes</b></div><p>Right after Advance Guardian Heroes, Treasure set forth to remake another one of their classics, Gunstar Heroes.  Gunstar Heroes was actually Treasure's first game, right after Masato Maegawa and a bunch of his friends split from Konami.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes is a character shmup.  You play Blue or Red as you blast away hordes upon hordes of enemies that never stop coming.  You just keep killing and killing and killing.  It's great fun ^_^ and is considered one of the best shmups of the sub-genre.</p><p>Gunstar Heroes was made for the Sega Genesis and made full use of the hardware.  It was released along side Sega hardcore Arcade lineup and found an excellent home.</p><p>In Oct of 2005, Treasure released <b>Gunstar Super Heroes</b> for the Gameboy Advance.  This release also saw a disappointed release as the public really had no idea what Gunstar Heroes was.</p><p>Despite the poor sales, It's really an amazing game.  It's Treasure's love letter to Sega fans, using several themes of the Arcade Genesis it was originally released with, like After Burner and a couple other ones I don't quite remember.</p><p>Gunstar Super Heroes is damn awesome, so you should pick up a copy at your local Toys R Us for about $15.  Also, Gunstar Heroes is available of Wii Virtual Console for $8, which is also a damn good buy.</p><div class='title'><b>Bangai-O</b></div><p>So, that brings us to today.  By the end of the year, Treasure will release it's third remake on the DS, entitled <b>Bangai-O Spirits</b>.</p><p>Bangai-O is in a weird genre.  It's a free-roaming shmup, where you explore around the level and reach the boss at the end.  I guess, technically, it would be a side-scrolling shmup, except you fly in all directions whenever you want.  The point of Bangai-O is to make massive explosions with bombs laying around the stage and destroy as much as possible with various chains of explosions.</p><p>It was originally released for the Nintendo 64, but found a home on the Dreamcast as well..  that's the only version that was released in the states.</p><p>ugh..  I'm god awful at this game.  I really couldn't figure out how to play it, and I ended up just getting really frustrated with it..  Some people consider it to be one of Treasure's best games, but I don't really see it.</p><p><em>New Features</em>:  Unlike previous remakes, this Bangai-O Spirits looks like it adds a ton of stuff.  Multiplayer (both Co-op and versus), Map Editor, Full map on the top screen..  this actually sounds pretty badass.</p><div class='title'><b>In other news...</b></div><p>This all comes rather timely, as Microsoft, at their pre-TGS conference, finally officially announced that <b>Ikaruga</b> will be coming to Xbox Live Arcade next year.  Ikaruga is my favorite Treasure title, and I also deem it as Treasure's best game.. hands down.</p><p><a href="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html" title="http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html">http://www.racketboy.com/retro/microsoft/xbla/2007/09/ikaruga-and-rez-hd-confirmed-for-xbox-live-arcade.html</a></p><p>Ikaruga is a beautiful horizontal-scrolling shmup featuring the Zen of fighting light v. dark.  Enemies are of both light and dark, and you are able to combat and absorb their powers by flipping your side, back and forth, between light and dark.</p><p>Stunning game.</p><p><em>Also</em>, along side Ikaruga, <b>Rez</b>, <b>Every Extend Extra</b>, and <b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b> will also be making their way on XBLA.

I will never own an original Xbox, mainly because all my good Xbox games are now backwards compatible, the controller is rather horrid, and the overall bias the Japanese games are far superior to American games.. definitely on consoles.</p><p>But the 360 has changed a lot of things.  It's a very robust machine that IS changing gaming, and some good games are actually beginning to appear on the console.</p><p>I've been absolutely blown away by Mass Effect, but one cannot ignore Halo 3.</p><div class='title'><b>Rationale</b></div><p>I have decided to buy Halo 3 on launch day, but main rationale behind owning/playing it, is to re-live an old past-time that Justin (my army pal) and I shared nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Back in the day, Justin and I played the living crap out of Goldeneye.  In the morning, we'd have school, and in the evening we'd meet up at our jobs at Toys R Us.  I ran the video game section there, and the manager's usually made him do crap work.</p><p>As the store came to a close, and I hid the last of my re-shop, He and I would get back to his place around 10:30pm, and end up playing versus Goldeneye until 1 or 2am on a school night.  We'd do this damn near every night, and occasionally drag other co-workers along for the ride.</p><p>Our video game days were pretty much over when he decided to join the military..</p><p>Several months ago, he picked up a 360 and have found a new love in video gaming.  He's played the crap out of most of the major releases such as Rainbox 6 Vegas, Ghost Recon, and Bioshock.  He is eagerly anticipating the release of Halo 3, so he pushes it onto me.</p><p>At this point, I was teetoring either way, but what really clenched it for me were these Best Buy midnight parties, with free stuff.  Video game events are badass, so why the hell not.  The rationale outweighs the irrationale.</p><div class='title'><b>Decisions</b></div><p>So, I'm gonna preorder Halo 3, BUT which copy do I buy?  I've got 3 to choose from.  Legendary Edition comes with 4 discs, a bunch of artbooks and a Spartan helmet all for $130...  Absolutely not.  So, really I have 2 choices: Regular Edition or Limited Edition.</p><p>Well, this is a tough decision for me.  I will always think twice, thrice, etc on whether or not to get the slightly more expensive Limited Edition versus the a stale 'ol Regular Edition.  It's collector nature for me.</p><p>My main distinction is that this is Halo.  It has already sold more than one million copies prior to its actual release.  It is going to be the most common, most played Xbox game ever.  This game will basically be worthless several weeks after release.  It's "collector" value with plomit faster than a fat guy into a buffet.</p><p>In a long enough span of time, the Limited Edition will retain more than a $10 lead on the Regular Edition.  The Regular Edition will probably be $20 around this time next year, whereas the Limited Edition will never be printed again.</p><p>BUT, is that really true?  I can still find copies of Halo 2 Limited Edition in used game stores for around $20, whereas the normal edition is $14.  The Limited Edition MAY be limited, but there are still around 500,000 copies of it floating around.  It's no where near rare.</p><p>Obviously, the collector's argument is not valid at all.</p><div class='title'><b>Value</b></div><p>Let's look at this argument from a different perspective.  Regular Edition is $60, and Limited Edition is $70.  You get raped by the inane price no matter which way you face..  So what's the difference between the 2 versions.</p><p>Regular Edition nets you Halo 3.  Limited Edition nets you Halo 3, hardcover Halo 3 artbook, Halo 3 fiction book, extra disc with "making of" features and HD calibration details, and a hardcover case that'll fit everything inside of it.  You get a ton of stuff for that extra $10.  Almost enough stuff to forget you're paying so much for the most common game you'll ever find in a year.</p><p>That's in a year though, and I've got two choices.. so the decision has been made on the Value argument.</p><div class='title'><b>Ironic</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/games/halo3_preorder.webp" /></p><p>So yeah, today I picked up the preorder for Halo 3 Limited Edition at my local Best Buy, which will be having its midnight release party in 13 days.</p><p>I find it rather ironic that Halo 3 will be the first Xbox 360 or Xbox game that I'll be purchasing at full price..  Mass Effect will no longer have that honor.  Unless you count those Burger King games, which were bought at the full price of $4 each..<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 11, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 10, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Phoenix Wright: Release History</h3><p>After the completion of Metroid Prime 3, I've been really getting into Phoenix Wright 3.  I usually play about an hour or two every night, and currently I'm on the second investigation part on the third (out of four) cases.  It's kinda fun, but it certainly does not have the intensity of innovation I experience when I played the first Phoenix Wright.</p><div class='title'><b>Release History</b></div><p>Let's explore the releases of Phoenix Wright to further understand the lineage of the series.</p><p>Phoenix Wright was first released for the Nintendo DS, here in the US on October 12th, 2005; however, the DS versions of Phoenix Wright, or Gyakuten Saiban are actually remakes of the Gameboy Advance games.  Gyakuten Saiban 1 was first released 4 years prior on the same date for the GBA.</p><p><pre>10/12/01 - Gyakuten Saiban - 58,877 units sold</pre></p><p>It's release did not do so well, but that didn't stop Capcom from making a sequel.  Just one year later, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was released.  Of course, Gyakuten Saiban 2 was the exact same game, but with different music, different stories, and some new characters ^_^.  Capcom re-released the first title on the same day at a budget price to increase sales for the series overall.</p><p><pre>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 129,630 units sold<br/>10/18/02 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 - 176,953 units sold</pre></p><p>Which, worked fairly damn well.  All those that missed Phoenix Wright the first time around, easily picked up both titles now that the first one was a mere $30.  Capcom LOVES to make billions of sequels, so it comes to no surprise that they did the exact same thing the year after.</p><p><pre>12/19/03 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 101,388 units sold<br/>01/23/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 - 173,336 units sold</pre></p><p>Actually, after playing PW3, it's rather hard to picture it selling 173k units.  The IP seemed pretty strong.  Sure it wasn't moving a million units, but nearly 200k units is pretty good for Japan sales.</p><p>I'm not really sure what happened at this point..  But Gyakuten Saiban 4 did not follow the next year.  Perhaps something happens at the end of the third game that simply can't allow for a 4th game with Phoenix Wright..  As October came up, they released PW3 at a budget price.</p><p><pre>10/01/04 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 68,181 units sold</pre></p><p>But, with no new game to push sales of the old game..  it did nearly as well as the series debut.  Fall of 2004 saw a shift in Handheld gaming though..  This was the time where the Nintendo DS was released.  Capcom decided to hop on the DS craze by porting over their slight successful game series.</p><p><pre>09/15/05 - Gyakuten Saiban - 128,842 units sold<br/>10/12/05 - Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - ~100,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The 5th year of Gyakuten Saiban, brought forth the DS version of the game with slightly better graphics and a NEW DS only case after you beat the game.  Original fans of the series flocked to the new level, whereas new adopters of the series fell in love with Phoenix Wright for the first time.</p><p>Over here in the US, the game sold poorly thanks to poor marketing and very few units shipped.  It wasn't until Spring of 2006 rolled around and people had huge difficulty finding the game, that Capcom realized it was their fault for the poor sales.  They re-release the US version a couple times, while over in Japan, they released the game at a budget to pull more people into the series.</p><p><pre>06/15/06 - Gyakuten Saiban (Best Price) - 149,552 unit sold</pre></p><p>Now, I don't know if the original DS release had this, but this budget release just so happened to include the full English version of the game.  Gamers in the US helped add to these sales since they could not find a US copy.  Sales were also very high due to the release of the DS Lite which happened 2 months prior.</p><p>A couple months later saw the revamp and release of the Second title.</p><p><pre>10/26/06 - Gyakuten Saiban 2 (Best Price) - 111,485 units sold<br/>01/16/07 - Phoenix Wright 2: Justice for All - 90,000 units sold</pre></p><p>The Japanese release started right off as a budget title, which makes complete sense as it lacked a DS only chapter.  The Japanese release also contained the full English version of the game, which can account for lack-luster US sales.  Die-hard US Phoenix Wright fans simply imported the game to play it months ahead of time.</p><p>Along with the Japanese release, began the promotional support for the long-awaited release of Gyakuten Saiban 4.  A new original game for the series that contained all new characters, and all chapters which used all capabilities of the DS, and in April of 2007..  fans finally got their game.</p><p><pre>04/12/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 4 - 487,000 units sold</pre></p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was hands-down, the fastest selling title of the series.  In fact, in its first week it sold more copies than any single version of a previous game.  Thanks to all these crazy previous releases, fans knew what was coming for the series.  DS chapters much like that extra chapter in the first game.</p><p>Gyakuten Saiban 4 was such a success, that a few weeks later, Capcom simply blurting out that Gyakuten Saiban 5 would happen.</p><p>Unfortunately, for US fans of the series, Gyakuten Saiban 4 does not contain the English version, so we must wait for the US release, or perhaps it'll be included on its' budget release.</p><p>Anyways, just 2 weeks away, Capcom finally released Gyakuten Saiban 3, and fans of the series who missed it the first time, can finally see how Phoenix Wright's saga ends.</p><p><pre>08/23/07 - Gyakuten Saiban 3 (Best Price) - 77,000 (so far)</pre></p><p>Not too far off, Phoenix Wright 3 will be hitting the states.</p><p><pre>10/23/07 - Phoenix Wright 3: Trials and Tribulations</pre></p><p>Capcom is currently holding the 3rd game over the heads of us US fans of the series..  "If you want Phoenix Wright 4, you'll have to buy Phoenix Wright 3.  If sales are good, it's a go!"  Though, they are already planning on bringing it over as <em>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney</em>.</p><p>Honestly, I cannot wait for Apollo Justice..  So much so, that i'll actually play through Phoenix Wright 3 ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Total Sales</b></div><p>So, let's tabulate all the current sales and see how the individual games actually stack up against each other.</p><p><pre>Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (5 versions) - ~566,901 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Justice for All (4 versions) - ~479,826 worldwide<br/>Phoenix Wright: Trials and Tribulations (3 versions) - 318,517 japan only, so far<br/>Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney (1 version) - 487,000 japan only</pre></p><p>I'd imagine sales for Apollo Justice eventually overtaking the original game, no problem.</p><p><b><i>Update:</i></b> By the way, I should really mention that I acquired this data from Cubed3 who found it from the Neo-GAF post I originally saw it in, which happens to be 4 months out of date, and also from vgchartz.com which is almost never accurate.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 10, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 5, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Dangerous Knowledge</h3><p>Yesterday, I came across this amazing documentary entitled: Dangerous Knowledge.  It's been passed around the internet quite a bit, so there's a possibility you may have seen it pop up since it's debut yesterday.  The website, Best Free Documentaries, has got it right here:</p><p><a href="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html" title="http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html">http://bestdocumentaries.blogspot.com/2007/09/dangerous-knowledge-full-documentary.html</a></p><p>Dangerous Knowledge is about 4 amazing mathematicians who descended into madness trying to solve some impossible questions..</p><div class='title'><b>Georg Canter</b></div><p>Canter, a German mathematician, is the first subject of this documentary born 1845 died 1918.  His birth of madness began with trying to understand the infinite.  He could not accept that one infinite space is equal to another infinite space..</p><p>for example: a 1 by 1 square contains an infinite amount of points.  well, a 2 by 1 square also contains an infinite amount of points.  Through Mathematics, both infinities are equal.  Well this can't be!  The 2 by 1 square has twice the area as the 1 by 1 square.  Surely the infinite space of the 2 by 1 is at least twice the size as the 1 by 1 square.  But Mathematics says No!  It's the same.</p><p>Logically this makes no sense, so Canter sought to proves that there are an infinite amount of infinities, which became known as Canter's Theorem.  Well..  doing so totally unraveled the thought of mathematics.  Simple things became untrue.  This doesn't make any sense either..  So he began working at it the other way..  Since these simple basics of mathematics are true, then they shall disprove his infinite infinites..  Well he found out to also be impossible.</p><p>Day by Day he worked on this until his son died..  and with his son's death, he lost a part of himself.  He killed himself because of what he lost because of his failure to prove or disprove his theorem.  There's also some religious mumbo-jumbo in there too.</p><div class='title'><b>Ludwig Boltzmann</b></div><p>Boltzmann is our second case and lived in the same time frame, born 1844 died 1906.  Boltzmann was physicist and hypothesized that time is irreversible.  Time is not something that can be defined on two way plane, it is an ever-driving forward concept that can never be stopped.</p><p>Today, we already know this.  In fact, this is what modern physics is based on today.  Boltzmann, unfortunately, discovered this fact 20 years too early, before later physicists adopted the truth.  But because he lived in a time of unquestionable obedience to world leaders, such a massive concept was utterly opposed because of what it implicated.</p><p>The severe oppositions to Boltzmann's discovery drove him into a deep depression that he escaped when he committed suicide.</p><p>The final two cases are of <b>Kurt Godel</b> and <b>Alan Turing</b>, who both saw Canter's work, believed to have understood it, and began to solve it in their own ways.  Both men were born around the times of the Boltzmann's and Canter's deaths.</p><div class='title'><b>Kurt Godel</b></div><p>Godel was an Austrian mathematician who fell into the same madness that Canter had suffered from, but began looking at the problem a little differently.  Through trying to understand why infinite was undefinable, he began to understand certainty and completeness.  He set forth to define these abstract topics..</p><div class='title'><b>Alan Turing</b></div><p>Out of these 4, Alan Turing is the most I was familiar with prior to the film.  Alan Turing is particularly famous in the field of Artificial Intelligence and modern Computer Science as well.  He figured that if this theorem was actually solvable then a Computer could surely figure it out.</p><div class='title'><b>The Halting Problem</b></div><p>This where Turing had developed one of his most famous Theorems: the halting problem.  The basic thought of the theorem is how do you tell if a problem is unsolvable..  In AI class back in Platteville, Professor Hasker put this problem in terms of finding infinite loops in your code.  Is there ever a way to determine whether your program is stuck in an infinite loop, or does it just take a really long time to run?  How do you determine this way code?<br/><pre><br/><pre>//paraphrased from old notes from Hasker's class<br/>//http://www.uwplatt.edu/csse/courses/prev/s07/cs303/notes/303n01.html</p><p>public void work(String input)<br/>{<br/><span/>   if( terminatesOnInput(input) )<br/><span/>   {<br/><span/>      //statement #1<br/><span/>      sysout("Program can operate on passed input");<br/><span/>   }<br/><span/>   else<br/><span/>   {<br/><span/>      //statement #2<br/><span/>      sysout("Program is caught in an infinite loop while processing input");<br/><span/>   }<br/>}</pre><br/></pre><br/>There no possible way statement #2 will ever be called, because the terminatesOnInput will be stuck in an infinite loop, BUT how do we know that the input passed is such that it just takes a while.  Are you going to wait a week to see if the input takes a week to process?  Or is it just unsolvable?</p><p>In the real world, if something takes more than a minute or two, there's something wrong..  but in the research field, in philosophy and mathematics, how long is too long?</p><div class='title'><b>Turing's madness</b></div><p>How could you not go crazy thinking about this?  Turing began to think of Canter's continuum theorem as the difference between humans and machines.  Machines are irrefutable logic devices which can solve anything, so us, as humans, most possess an extra attribute beyond the capacity of a computer to go above and beyond.  He thought of this as our intuition, but he figured that machines had the capability to intuitively seek out answers and grow..</p><p>He absorbed himself so much in this problem that he could not tell the difference between Human and Machine.  What was it to be human, and how could this NOT be replicated with machine..</p><p>Anywho, to Turing's defense, foundationally it wasn't the halting problem or the continuum theorem that ultimately led to his death.  He was homosexual, in a time when homosexuality was a mental deficiency.  He was very open about it as well, which didn't take too long for "concerned" citizens to commit him to an insane asylum.</p><p>The treatment for homosexuality was pumping him full of estrogen, which doesn't make any sense at all early-mid 1900 doctors.  Turing began to grow breasts and other womanly features..  Turing began to contradict himself as he contradicted humanity..  and killed himself as a result of overwhelming uncertainty.</p><div class='title'><b>Check it out</b></div><p>Pretty crazy stuff, eh?

So instead of going into the office I can do whatever I want.  Funny that, I ended up spending close to 6 hours both finishing up that poorly written Metroid Prime and migrating all my Movable Type journal entries to this Wordpress blog.</p><p>The main bulk of that time was cutting out the 24,000 comments from prescription drug companies, magazine, and pornographic websites.  After toying around, they were all posted on one article, so cutting them out was pretty easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Exporting Movable Type into Wordpress</b></div><p>Movable Type's exporting is quite amazing, by the way.  It dumps all the articles into a text file   They have a bizzare format, but it's still pretty readable:<br/><pre>--------<br/>AUTHOR: dyre<br/>TITLE: stuff?<br/>STATUS: Draft<br/>ALLOW COMMENTS: 0<br/>CONVERT BREAKS: __default__<br/>ALLOW PINGS: 0<br/>PRIMARY CATEGORY: daily<br/>CATEGORY: daily</p><p>DATE: 10/09/2003 08:43:39 AM<br/>-----<br/>BODY:<br/>omitted boring emotional text.<br/>-----<br/>EXTENDED BODY:</p><p>-----<br/>EXCERPT:</p><p>-----<br/>KEYWORDS:</p><p>-----</pre><br/><pre><br/>--------</pre><br/>Even though Wordpress is an annoying piece of crap, it has a convient "import from Movable Type" feature, which is very helpful.  So Importing all these old entries really only took 5 minutes.  200 more articles in 5 whole minutes..  not bad.</p><div class='title'><b>Upkeep on old stale articles</b></div><p>Despite my best judgement, I decided not to cut out content related to my life at the time, so there's plenty of school related articles talking about how lazy I can be, what classes I was attending, what homework I need to do and also several articles talking about my girlfriend at the time.</p><p>All those personal articles really tappered off when broke up with her and took a 9 or 10 month break from the internet, so around April 2004 my articles became more about the subject I was writting about and less about what I did that weekend or how I felt about the crushing stress of finishing off a semester at Platteville.  Paints an emotional picture doesn't it?</p><p>To fit all these new articles, I added a couple new categories, and also organized them into sub-groups.  I also made an <b>Opinion</b> category for all my reviews, gamelogs, and impressions about various Games, Moves, Music Events and such.</p><div class='title'><b>Still more</b></div><p>There are still plenty of articles that predate installing Movable Type that I haven't gathered up, but I could easily make a program that would convert all those entries into a Movable Type backup file, and have Wordpress import them.  Handy!</p><p>Many of these are very old reviews, but are still pretty funny..  like my Treasure Planet review, Kingdom Hearts review, and Magnolia review..  Now that I finished up Metroid, maybe that's what I'll work on.</p><div class='title'><b>Bored?</b></div><p>Well, if you're really bored, feel free to go back in time and read all those articles.  It's not like these haven't already been on the internet over at <a href="/old/v6/journal" title="/journal">theschlock.com/journal</a>, so you don't really gain anything new from reading them, unless you haven't read them.  You'd probably want to use the Search engine and category trees to your advantage to finding the better articles though.</p><p>Some of my old reviews are kinda funny at least.  especially my timely <a href="/old/v6/metriod-prime-2-impressions" title="/metriod-prime-2-impressions">Metroid Prime 2 review</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>ADVICE</b></div><p>by the way, NEVER use wordpress's entry edited for writing your blog posts.  Wordpress uses some funky CSS and Javascript to make your articles look like they do after you submit them.  BUT because of this, the text field is not longer a trackable DOM field.  SO when you submit an article, the text is immediately whisked away to the HTTP request and the field is blanked out.</p><p>What does this mean?  It means if you end up getting any browser errors, domain errors.. basically any error at all: <b><em>You lose your entire post!</em></b>  I've had this happen to me enough, that I don't even use the editor unless I'm actually edited an entry.</p><p>I use Wordpad to actually write out all my entries, and then I just copy and paste them into the editor, hit save, and then hit publish.</p><p>I'm currently using Wordpress 2.0.4, so maybe they've fixed it, but I'm not taking any chances anymore.  Especially when Firefox is somewhat buggy too and can crash at will.</p><p>Something to think about anyways..<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on September 3, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">September 2, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Metroid Prime 3 Full Impressions</h3><p>Getting into Metroid Prime 3 was very easy for me.  I've been waiting for a game on the Wii that I could tear apart and dive into without hestitation.  Metroid is that game.</p><p>It's very odd though.. What do I like about Metroid Prime 3?  My overall feelings towards the game are very numb and complacent.  There are so many mediocre points in the game, but are easily looking over while playing the game.</p><div class='title'><b><em>By the way..  this review will continue mountains of spoilers, so please don't read on if you don't wish to be spoiled</em></b></div><div class='title'><b>Playing the game..</b></div><p>Playing this game is a dream.  I absolutely love the gameplay.  Honestly, I can see why people are so ape shit about the gameplay and say stupid things like, "This is the best console fps experience you'll ever have."  That's a bold statement, but I think I would agree that the controls are spot on.  Overall, I do prefer this over dual analog sticks.  You get FAR more control and precision shooting things with the Wii-mote.  A little joystick cannot compare to the Wii-mote at all.</p><p>This is how you make a Wii game.  This is how you make full use of the Wii-mote and motion controls with over burdening your gamer.  The little subtle actions of showing off the motion controls are great because they only happen when you're completely focused are flipping a switch, turning screw controls, or pulling out energy containers.</p><div class='title'><b>Reviewing this game..</b></div><p>It's because of this beautiful gameplay that everyone loves the game.  It's the same reason I love it.  So many publications give this game a 10 or a 9.5 simply because of this, but I don't know why they didn't grade the game harsher on its fall backs.  The gameplay is like that genius student in your class that makes up for all the others students getting Cs.  The gameplay is that one cop that goes out on a limb to solve the case in the most elaborate and thorough way (like John Mcclain), while everything else in the game simply plays it straight and safe.</p><p>There's so much mediocrity in this game that is overshadowed by the gameplay that just isn't getting press, but with good reason.  In good conscience can reviewers really just gloss over everything else because it is blantly bad and give it a perfect 10 based on gameplay alone?</p><p>It's weird..  I'm not dissapointed with the game, and I think they did a fantastic job with it too.  Here..  I'll just tell you what I think about it..</p><div class='title'><b>The Music..</b></div><p>The music in Metroid Prime 3 is absolutely bland.  They overuse that organic flange like it was pop rocks in the 80s.  The music is so uninspired, so subtle...  but it doesn't get in your way.  The music doesn't push the environment on you; it's just there to create an ambiance, but doesn't fit with the environment at all.  It reminds me of Doom for some reason, but far more low key.</p><p>The background music does feel very Metroid, but it doesn't feel alien at all.  More mission driven and pumping.</p><p>However, this is completely overruled by One track in the game that had me blown away.  Put me in a state of awe.  That one track I was waiting for the entire game to blow me away.  The Ice level has absolutely beautiful background music.  Fluttering high-note piano music raining snow onto the land, the fields, the statues, and me in the middle of it.</p><p>This was the first point in teh game that I actually stopped for a moment and took it in.  Listened to the beautiful orchestrated notes take me to this place, much like it did back in Metroid Prime 1 with Phendrana..  the Ice planet.  That's kinda weird isn't it?  How can the best two tracks in the Metroid Prime series both be from Ice worlds.  They should make christmas music or something..  Metroid Prime 4: Lost in the Ice Kingdom would probably be the best videogame OST in the history of gaming.</p><p>But that's it.  I went through the Ice world, collected the Screw Attack, and left..  That was it for the entire fricken game..  The only other track that comes close is the menu music..  That's somewhat decent.</p><p>It's rather funny that the quality of Music forms and equal parallel to game overall.  There's one piece of music that keeps you from counting out the music all together.</p><div class='title'><b>The Environments..</b></div><p>This is the first Metroid where you aren't on One planet the whole game.  Overall, you have 5 major planets and a few other places consisting of at least a dozen unique areas of exploration.  Actually, the more I think about it, the diversity within a planet really tells the story of civilization on that planet.  The 5 planets you explore are Norion, Bryyo, Elysia, Pirate Homeworld and Phaze, though I suppose Phaze really doesn't count.</p><p>The environments you encounter through the game are pretty standard.  You walk around on a battle cruiser like in a Halo 2, go through a federation outpost which is pretty standard.  Metroid begins very federation oriented which is unlike any other Metroid and everything like most space opera sci-fi.  Once you finally break free of the federation and begin exploring, you start to encounter actual alien worlds.</p><p>The first alien world is Bryyo and is also the most under developed of the planets.  It's quite interesting that because it's the most under developed, it is also the most varied in enviroments.  You do come across a pirate outpost, but it is thick within the jungle.  On the side of the planet, you have the firey volcanos.  Within the fire pits, you come across a warp point to the Ice caverns.  On this one planet, you have complete polar opposites, somewhat like Earth.</p><p>Because of the varied environments you have all kinds of plant, animal and sentient life, which doesn't make sense why it's the most boring planet of them all.  Hurray i'm in a Jungle.. Hurrah I'm in a volcano.  Hurrah i'm in an ice cavern (but the music is beautiful).  Don't get me wrong, they all look quite good, but don't go that extra mile to really WOW me.  All these environments have already been done in Metroid Prime 1.</p><p>Elysia.  Now HERE is a planet that made me stop and just look around at everything.  Elysia is a lot like Jupiter, a gasious liquid planet that nothing can live on, unless you were in the upper atmosphere away from the violent death storms.  You walk around on a settlement built in the sky which is completely built on <em>Steam</em>.  Oh baby..   A Steampunk planet..  fucking brilliant.</p><p>All the little robots are steam powered.  When you walk around, they are little repair bots working on the station to keep it running and working.  The enemy robots are straight out of 50s scifi.  A very hostile andriod looking robot firing ring beams at you.  I love Elysia, but what really annoyed me was everywhere you went was the same.  You didn't have a multiple varied environments like you did back on Bryyo.</p><p>After Elysia, you go to the Pirate Homeworld was is more standard technology type stuff.  It kinda reminds me of the Borg homeworld and to finish off the game you go to planet Phaze which is beautiful, but pretty standard stuff at this point after going into the Leviathan ships.</p><p>One other spiffy place you can go is optional and it is the remenants of a battle between Federation and Pirates which was over-swarmed by Metroids.  This is my absolute favorite point in the game because you are investigating what actually happened to this federation ship and uncovering clues to the actual menance that awaits you at the end of the game.</p><p>Because this area is optional, you need to find Energy Cells throughout the game to repower doors, ramps and elevators in this deserted graveyard.  There needed to be MUCH MUCH more of this, rather than just chasing around pirates.  Focus the game on METROIDS, not the stupid pirate conspiracies involving metroids.  Use your graphically power to show off how deadly the metroid race is, rather than some submissive controlled species.</p><div class='title'><b>Metroids..</b></div><p>Hey guess what.. let's talk about how under utilized Metroids are in Metroid Prime 3.  How do you kill a Metroid?  This is video game survival 101.  You freeze it, and fire 5 missiles at it which will shatter the monster.  That's pretty much what you do in Metroid Prime 3, however you also kill a Metroid through hypermode or a sniped headshot, which makes it way to easy.</p><p>The whole point of fighting a Metroid is to feel like you are David versus Goliath.  Metroids are ruthless, energy sucking parasites which will devour every ounce of strength you have.  Metroid Prime 3 portreys the Metroid species just as any other creatures in the game.  Just another enemy in your way.  In fact, there are more menancing creatures in the game than Metroids.</p><p>The only scene that came close to showing off Metroid brutality was one Metroid dragging a federation soldiers corpse through a hallway.</p><p>There needs to be a scene, NOT a cutscene, where a bunch of Metroids break free and run rampant through a planet, chewing on the nearby animals, all while you are fending them off and trying to get away before falling victim.  Metroids are basically higher level alien zombies..  Why not feed on the anxiety and suspense of a zombie attack in a Metroid game?</p><p>You'd be fucked if you came up against 3 Metroids.. but not in Metroid Prime 3.  blam blam.. they're dead, you're safe.  bullshit.</p><div class='title'><b>The Story..</b></div><p>Besides that, the story is still rather lacking.  You basically go through space, fighting off pirate advances and learn of the growing menance of Phazon.  All while, the phazon inside of you is growing and slowly taking over.</p><p>Being slowly corrupted is a great plot device, but means nothing when your character doesn't talk or give any emotional indication of being corrupted.  Samus is basically a robot inside of her armor suit.  This is one of things I noticed right away after killing one of her friends in the beginning.  She is emotionally disconnected with the story, which makes it really hard to play a character driven game.</p><p>HOWEVER..  This special ending finally brings emotion into Samus..  It's really a shame that you have to get 75% complete in order to view this ending, because this IS the emotion missing from the game.  Samus lands on Elysia, takes off her helmet and looks into the clouds.  She stares saddenly into the distance and thinks about her friends, their corruption into madness, and her duty to put them down..  It's very powerful, though has crappy music that could have made it more powerful.</p><p>The super special ending after getting 100% complete continues from there.  She walks back to her ship, takes off the rest of her suit, and then goes into space.  After flying into the distance, another ship rises from the surface as well, and follows her.  OMG sequel!</p><div class='title'><b>blah blah blah..</b></div><p>To sum it up, Metroid Prime 3 is pretty slick.  It is a great example of how game developers need to utilize the Wii-mote's abilities to the fullest.  Definitely play this game.  <em>This is the best game on the Wii right now.</em></p><p>As you can see from all the text above, I don't really feel overly amazed by the game, but it definitely doesn't suck.
