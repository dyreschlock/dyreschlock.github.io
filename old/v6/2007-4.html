A gigantic pile of stuff that i own, but don't really want to deal with.  I like owning things.</p><p>One thing that was incredibly liberating about living in Japan for a while was my absence of stuff.  I left America with a suitcase filed with clothes, a laptop, my DS and games, and a couple personal items.  In Japan, i was free of all my worldly attachments as they were back on planet America.  Liberated.  Though, it was very reassuring that i hadn't lost anything.  A world away, my huge pile of stuff still sat there.  Still mine.  There was, maybe, once or twice that i wished i had a movie of mine with me in Japan, but beyond that, it never brought me down that i didn't have my stuff.</p><p>Well, i suppose i did have my online 'Stuff' with me.  My blog, pictures, and tons of other crap.</p><p>Truthfully, i had really been doing this for years during college.  My parents house is home to my main pile of stuff, and i would leave it up in Minneapolis, as i lived down in Platteville.  Throughout that time, i would acquire some new things and every one in a while, I would add these new things to my gigantic pile of stuff in Minneapolis.  I was never in a position where i couldn't visit my stuff pile without great difficulty.</p><p>Throughout my time in Japan, i did acquire several new things.  I started growing a new pile of stuff, and forget about what i had at home.  When i got back home, all my stuff was in one place, yet again.  My game library was all together.  My books were there, comics, flyers, etc...</p><p>But how much does all this stuff weigh me down.  Why do i need issue 43 of Nintendo power?  Who do i need a Club flyer of Bad Boy Bill from 2003?  Why do i need all my CS notes from College?</p><p>These are really just piles of stuff, and the only reason i feel the need to own them is because of sentiment.  I got that issue of Nintendo Power in the mail in 1990, and used the maps inside to beat that Nintendo Game.  I got that flyer from The Quest or Vital Vinyl when i was there that Summer and probably took pictures.  I spent fruitless amounts of time copying those notes down because it was imperative for later use.  They are a part of my history, it's not necessarily that they are monetarily valuable.  It's like being the curator for my own personal library.</p><p>This stuff is primarily relics from the past, but i hold onto things for the future.  What if i or some friend wishes to play this game, or read this book, or watch this movie, or etc?  Then we can share in part of my past.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on April 25, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">April 19, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Indigo Prophecy</h3><p><div class='title'><b>Graphics</b></div><p>New York is the center stage for the end of humanity.  Beautiful looking snow falls from the dark sky.  Blankets of snow wave through the air, falling towards the water, as the camera continues to fly over the pacific, past the statue of liberty, and into the cityscape.  The camera flies past nicely detailed building.  Some windows are illuminated with inner light that partially displays the room inside.</p><p>Through the maze of buildings, the camera moves downward towards a street corner, bathed in snow.  Some oddly shaped cars are parked on the street, as others move down the street.  The lighting effects are pretty standard for the Xbox.  Being emulated on an Xbox 360 adds that extra crisp touch-up to the hunky models, and makes everything look very clean.</p><div class='title'><b>Story</b></div><p>At the wrong place, at the wrong time, Lucas Kane finds himself powerless, and manipulated.  In some sort of trance, he watches himself carve symbols into his forearms.  His body is possessed and moving on its own accord.  He creeps forward, foot by quivering foot.  Out of the bathroom stall, and closer towards a man washing his hands at the sink.  He can't stop himself.  His hand grasps the knife harder and thrusts it into the man, who doesn't see him coming..  despite the fact he's looking in a mirror.. what the hell?</p><p>On the man, is in pain..  his left ventricle artery severed from the heart.  The knife comes down twice more, severing the other arteries.  The sacrifice had been made.</p><p>And now you can control yourself again..  You are Lucas Kane.  you just murdered someone in the bathroom of a dinner you've never really been to before.  Your meal is half eaten at your table.  Your fork and spoon lie there with your meal.. but the knife is in your hands.  Quick!  Gotta hide everything.</p><div class='title'><b>Gameplay</b></div><p>That's how you are left at the beginning of Indigo Prophecy.  You can freely walk around the bathroom, even hold down the A button to run.  But the right analog stick controls your actions.  When you come close to something you can do, actions will pop up at the top of the screen and show what right analog stick movements to do to carry them out.</p><p>Jesus..  clean yourself up, stash the body, get rid of the murder weapon, and get yourself out of this situation.  Halfway through this process, the Cop at the counter, Stanley, needs to relieve himself.  He excuses himself from Kate, the only waitress at the diner, and begins walking towards the bathroom.</p><p>Split screen..  The widescreen presentation squishes your screen down just a little bit to reveal the steps and movements of the officer closing in on the bathroom on an upper screen.  A fuse timer slowly burns away to indicate your fleeting seconds that remain.  You'd better hurry up with that body..  He's coming closer!</p><p>Looks good to me..  now get out of there.  You move casually out the door, past the cop and towards the door, while the cop enters the bathroom.  He's not looking, BOLT!  "Sir!  you forgot to pay your bill...  sir!"  Crap..  aww, screw it.  Better than letting her get a good look at me.</p><p>The horizontal split dissolves into a vertical split as you enter the snowy streets.  The cop, now on the right side of your screen, searches the bathroom and finds the body, while You, on the left, run as fast as you can to the subway.</p><p>Scene..</p><div class='title'><b>Characters</b></div><p>You are a murderer..  But you're also detectives.  You are Carla Valenti and Tyler Miles assigned to investigate this murder.  You arrive at the scene, get out of the car, and talk with the officers.  You talk to the witnesses, examine the crime scene, and find clues about the murder you just committed minutes ago.</p><p>This is truly where Indigo Prophecy shines.  On one hand, you are a fugitive running from the long, trying to keep your sanity.  And on the other, you are two cops, tracking down your other character, while their personal lives suffer.  This game has amazing character depth, enriched with your own choices that effect interactions through-out the game...</p><div class='title'><b>Storytelling</b></div><p>The best way to describe this game is an Interactive Movie..  kinda like Dragon's Lair or Snatcher.  It a very modern adaption of that old gameplay style and works incredibly well.  You can piss off other characters, screw up the cops, or even screw up yourself.</p><p>With so many outcomes for subtle actions, it is Surprising that there's really One ending.  Well...  technically there are 3 endings, but the other two involve you screwing up the final fight at the end.  It's basically a glorified game over..  like when you first get the Epoch, go to year 1999, and lose right away.  Technically, it's an ending, but you didn't beat the game.  You didn't win.</p><p>The main plot and ending cannot be changed, but the game is divided into chapters where each has a main character.  Several chapters have multiple endings that aren't simply glorified game overs.  Depending on your actions, it will unlock or prevent other scenes in other chapters to come... but never anything that will result in an eventual unavoidable game over.</p><p>This is my major problem with the game..  Despite having complete control over conversations and actions, you are still restricted to the linear plot and its devices.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>Drakengard, or Drag-on Dragoon, is a very overlooked crappy game that has a great essence of splintering the story into multiple endings.  It is also divided into chapters that have specific events required of you to complete.  However, you can find hidden events within a chapter that will end it differently.  This will split the story into 2 continuums that you can follow and result in 2 separate endings.  The whole chapter storytelling system is linear in the first place, but this offered a way to change it and follow a different linear path.</p><p>Just a little bit of infraction in a linear world can make all the difference.  It certainly ups the replay value.  Anyways, i wish Indigo Prophecy did something like that early on in the game, rather than the last chapter only.</p><div class='title'><b>Too many Matrix parallels (spoilers)</b></div><p>That's not all that Indigo Prophecy misses the mark on.  There are many points in the story that take you out of the whole "i'm a normal guy trying to figure this out" type thing.  Lucas Kane seemed like a normal guy at the beginning.  A guy that you could relate to, but throughout the game his physical prowess just gets more and more ridonkulous.<br/>The first half of the game is kinda like Matrix 1, but the second half is more like Matrix 2..  Kane starts doing karate moves, flying through the air, dodging bullets (exactly like in the matrix), and fighting 'bosses' with super strength and speed.</p><p>When you get into the it, the story begins to resemble the Matrix as well.  The all controlling beings are really controlling everyone.  They've always been around, invisible to the masses.  The send out an agent of sorts to retrieve 'the one' who possesses enough powers to resist their power and eventually overcome them.</p><p>Hell, the agent they send after Kane is called 'the oracle'.</p><div class='title'><b>That's not all</b></div><p>There are two other things that annoy me about Indigo Prophecy, the action gameplay and the overall length.</p><p>When you find yourself in a position of dodging a bullet, the police, or just simple questions, it's time to play Simon.  You must press the blue button when it lights up, or press the green button when it lights up, and two separate Simon games representing the two analog sticks.  Up, down, down, left, right, right, down..  Red, blue, green, green, blue, yellow, red.  ugh..  At the least the controls in Dragon's Lair made sense. :/</p><p>The length is very disappointing considering there is only one ending.  I finished this game around the 6 1/2 hour mark, just a little bit ago.  Two casual nights of gaming was all it took to beat the boss and win the level.  The only replay value is replaying chapters to see alternate events..  There are also some mini-games of Simon replaying Key action sequences through the game, and a new one or two.</p><p>The length does make sense though, considering this game is really just a movie.</p><div class='title'><b>Right on</b></div><p>Despite all the bad: the length, the dumb gameplay, the references, the goofiness, the linearity..  I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.  Hell it won't take too much of your time anyways.  The story is very intriguing, compelling, and suspenseful.  It contains a lot of detective clue finding and discovery as to what is going on with Lucas Kane, and how to understand from the psychopath side of the things, as well as the investigation side of things.</p><p>One of my favorite scenes is when Carla meets Lucas for the first time to 'ask him a couple questions'.  You sort of play as both characters.  Carla puts on the pressure and ask inquisitively while Lucas keeps him calm trying not to freak out, while asking the questions, and trying to get through it.  It's an amazing point of view.</p><p>Indigo Prophecy is definitely worth a look-see. ^_^  If you can find it....</p><div class='title'><b>Late to the Party</b></div><p>Indigo Prophecy was released in September of 2005 for the PS2, Xbox, and PC.  I prefer the Xbox version, since i'm not a fan of playing PC games and the PS2 version had inferior graphics.  I went to a local Shopko one evening, and per chanced upon a copy for a modest price of $20.  I think $20 is a bit much for this game though..</p><p>I missed out the first time around, but with the December 2006 update to the Xbox 360's backwards compatibility library, i was set to go.  I put it in the 360 at our place..  I took seconds for the 360 to read the game, download the patch, and be ready to go.  I'm actually pretty glad I waited..  Slightly upscaled graphics and a much better controller.  huzzah!</p><p>If you own a 360, and haven't played it, definitely find yourself a copy of Indigo Prophecy..<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on April 19, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">April 16, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">End Gen Dreamcast (2)</h3><p><div class='title'><b>Karous</b></div><p>Karous was released in February 2007. I found this game on my latest trek back to Japan in my local new/used gaming store. They actually had a couple copies of the game, and one copy used for $45. I did think it over long and hard whether i should buy this game.. It is developed and self-published by Milestone, who also made Radilgy and Chaos Field. Chaos Field was actually a rather fun game, and Radilgy looked pretty crazy.. so, by association, i laid down my 4500 yen.</p><p>Karous is a very minimalist styled shooter through and through.  The graphics are cell-shaded and drenched in deep dark blues, greens and greys, but complemented with other over-used bright white.  It probably looked like a good idea on paper, but in execution looks very unfinished.  When you use cell-shading, you must be very aware of shapes and forms and how shadows well bring out the simplistic complexity of your subject.  I think cell-shading is a horrible medium for shooters because you have no time to soak in the subtleties and models are going to be too tiny to see any detail.</p><p>Unfortunately they carry this throughout each level like a dead horse.  I don't know if they re-use the same environments, but each stage looks exactly the same..  I really can't tell the difference.  All the enemies have the same grayscaled colors, so the bosses really can't be distinguished from each other easily.</p><p>The game does not scale very well either.  I can hardly see what the hell is going on with the game on my TV.  In Yoko mode, you can't even see what level your weapons are at.  Tate mode really isn't all that much better either.  Aliasing abound!</p><p>Anyways, the minimalistic theme continues into the music.  The soundtrack features plenty of broken drumming, chimes, and lack of melody that produces very experimental sounds.  It's a very different approach to a shooter OST and i'm not really sure that it works out for them.  You have no sense of suspense or thrill when playing levels..  It really ends up bothering me more than pulling me in.</p><p>The gameplay works very similar to Chaos Field.  You have 3 buttons..  One for shoot, one for bombs, and one for sword.  Also, when you stop shooting you have a shield which is automatically deployed.  Each of these attacks have a separate color.  (Green for sword, Blue for shot, Red for bomb, and Yellow for Shield.)  When you hit an enemies, they'll shimmer in the color of which weapon they are weakest against.  Most shimmer in Red, but you'll get the occasional green or yellow.</p><p>Each of your weapons can be powered up through use or grabbing power-ups.  These power-ups usually come from drones of like enemies, or big ass enemies.  You'll usually get a little blue triangle which you can smack a couple times with your sword to power-up.  Also, i think just general firing and killing powers up your bomb.</p><p>Overall, this game is challenging, but i'd only recommend it as a last resort.  The graphics are actually pretty bad, and the music doesn't complement the gameplay well.  It's actually kind of annoying to play..  I guess i now know the reason why Tom Sawyer had so many copies of the game..  Oh well...  the gameplay does have some redeeming qualities.</p><div class='title'><b>Trigger Heart Exelica</b></div><p>Exelica is the most recent Dreamcast game which came up March 2007. Purple Godzilla in Seattle, WA showcased this game at Sakura-Con and had it for a very fair price of $65, considering it was nearly identical to the Japanese price of 6500 yen. I had seen Exelica in Japanese arcades before, and #five actually played a bit too. The gameplay looked very different than your normal shmup, so i figured, hell, i'd give it a shot.</p><p>In Trigger Heart Exelica, you play Exelica or Crueltear, two anime girls out to save or defeat their friend or foe.  You wage war against an onslaught of futuristic space ships in your flying power armor.  The game reminds me a lot of Shikigami no Shiro for some reason, even though the two games are completely different.  Massive points are obtained through collecting gold pieces from destroyed enemies and fire.</p><p>You have 3 attacks: normal fire, bombs and grapple.  Exelica and Crueltear have different shoot waves..  Exelica is rather spread out, while Crueltear's is straight on.  Bombs are as standard as ever.</p><p>The grapple technique is what makes this game so unique.  You can grapple nearly any enemy on the screen.  Bigger enemies will take a little longer..  Once you've captured them, they will shield you from oncoming bullets, and you can also smash them into enemies for massive points and damage.  When you move back and forth while holding an enemy, you'll swing back and forth..  swinging the enemy all the way around you will put you into a spin that'll almost shield you completely against enemy fire.  When you let go, the enemy goes flying and it's explosion destroys everything in the immediate area.</p><p>This makes some impossible to dodge areas essential for using the grapple technique.  There's one particular part in Stage 3 where the entire screen is jam packed with enemies..  you can't even get around them.  Not to mention hundreds upon hundreds of bullets..  Grappling one enemy and tossing him in the center of all that mess will clean out a lot of your obstacles.</p><p>The graphics are pretty decent.  They aren't crazy mind blowing graphics, but they are certainly don't suck.  The music also compliments the game quite well.  Unfortunately the sounds could use a lot more bass.  Blowing up things is MUCH more satisfying with a sound that you can feel in your body.</p><p>Overall, this game is pretty fun, albeit spinning around while grappling an enemy can be difficult to get the hang of.  A little nick picky thing that i don't really like is that you start off with infinite credits, rather than eventually unlocking more over time.  Starting off with only a set amount of credits will inspire you to get better at the game, and eventually push yourself to greatness.  Having the whole game laid out to you on your first sitting is very unrewarding.</p><p>$65 is a very steep price for this game though.  That money would be better spent on Under Defeat.  If you came across this game in an arcade, i'd definitely recommend a few coins of play to see if you like it.</p><div class='title'><b>The tears of the ages...</b></div><p>Unfortunately, this is the end of the Dreamcast.  As of February this year, Sega has officially stopped all production of the GD-Rom medium, and 2 week ago, declared that on September 28th, 2007, Dreamcast Repair Services will cease completely.  The Dreamcast lasted nearly 9 years in the marketplace...  not too many consoles can say that.  Of course, those companies have bigger better projects to focus on.</p><p>This doesn't spell demise for the Naomi boards..  In fact, Triangle Service is currently developing their latest shmup, Exzeal, for the Naomi cabinets and set to be released this year.  Triangle Service had previous released Trizeal in 2005 for the Dreamcast.  This doesn't guarantee a Dreamcast release though..  Trizeal has been ported over to Ps2 for a wider audience.</p><p>G.rev's most recent game, Senko no Ronde, was also Naomi GD-Rom, but was remade and updated for home release on the Xbox 360, which is coming to the US next month thanks to Ubi Soft.  Senko no Ronde is shmup fighter hybrid type game.</p><div class='title'><b>Since Naomi<br/></b></div><p>Though Naomi development still goes on with 3rd party Arcade developers, Sega has moved on.  Not that long after Naomi originally debuted, Sega released the Naomi 2 in 2000.  Naomi 2 was a beefed up Naomi board with more better everything.  Though, with the pending death of the Dreamcast, Sega began focusing on other hardware.</p><p>Namco had already taken a cue from Sega, and had partnered with Sony to release Playstation-like hardware in the Arcades..  With console sales heading the gaming industry, Sega looked to the other consoles for Arcade hardware.</p><p>In 2002, Sega released the Chihiro hardware based on the Xbox.  Sega made a few changes though by scrapping the DVD-Rom drive for a GD-Rom drive, and make the RAM expandable for upgrades.  They also made full use of the communication capabilities of the Xbox and developed a slew of networkable titles.  These games you could play against anyone else in an Arcade across Japan.</p><p>Sega continued with their idea of making porting games easy from Arcade to Xbox and Xbox to Arcade.. Unfortunately, the Memory upgrades were used heavily in the Arcade which made scaling games to the home unit difficult.  Wikipedia points out that Outrun 2 used 512mb memory in the arcade, while the Xbox had only 64mb to work with.</p><p>Also in 2002, Sega has teamed up with Namco and Nintendo to release the Triforce Arcade hardware.  Partnership and development centered around the Nintendo Gamecube hardware and the release of F-Zero AX/GX, one of my favorite games of all time.  This was also a good opportunity for Nintendo to get some market share in the Arcades again..  Aside from F-Zero, Mario Kart GP is the other notable release for this hardware.  Mario Kart 2 was released early this year.</p><p>I guess the Sega, Namco, Nintendo Triforce partership was the middle ground for all big-name console and arcade hardware developers..  Sega w/ Microsoft, Namco w/ Sony, and Sega/Namco in the middle with Nintendo.</p><div class='title'><b>Turning to the future, PC in 2004</b></div><p>In 2004, Sega released their current Arcade hardware, the Lindbergh.  It was originally going to be based on the Xbox 360, but eventually became PC based instead.  In fact, also in 2004, Taito released their current arcade hardware which is also PC based..  PC based machines offered far more extensibility for upgrades and stacking processors..</p><p>That's kind of the same direction the shmup community has been going as well.  Independently developed PC shmups have really caught the eyes of many circles.  Especially the Toho Project, responsible for Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night.  I haven't played any of these though, unfortunately.</p><p>Anywho.. i guess we'll see where Shmups will find their home in this new generation.  Senko no Ronde is on the 360, Gradius VI is coming out on PS3..  all while the Wii might be the best home with low publishing costs and a very retro community fanbase.  Most shmups these past years have found themselves on the PS2 because of how popular it is, rather than how identical the hardware is to its' original.  I'm sure that'll be the same in the coming years.</p><div class='title'><b>Upcoming American Shmup Releases</b></div><p>April 17th.  Raiden III on Playstation 2 for $30<br/>April 27th.  Radilgy (Radio Allergy) on Gamecube for $30<br/>May 22nd.  Senko no Ronde (WarTech) on Xbox 360 for $60 ...  ugh :/<br/>Soon.

The Dreamcast had a very short life which began in November 1998 in Japan, and September 9th, 1999 in America.  In February 2002, NHL 2k2 was the last game released in America..  However, life continues to grow in small reaches thanks its initial purpose and devoted fans.</p><div class='title'><b>Parallel Arcade Development</b></div><p>The Sega Saturn was really the first instance of Sega developing their home console along-side arcade Hardware.  In 1994, Sega released the Saturn in Japan, alongside their ST-V arcade hardware.  Since the hardware was nearly identical, games arcade games developed for ST-V could be ported near exactly.  Fans could play exact copies of arcade games on their home console.  The other difference was that ST-V arcade units took huge clunky cartridges, while the Saturn took standard CDs.</p><p>The Saturn was initially flawed due to its emphasis on 2D graphics, and last minute 3D graphical additions.  2D games looked amazing, but the populous was captivated by the 3D marvels other consoles and arcade hardware provided.  Sega lost support, but they learned from their mistakes... sort of.</p><p>Sega began development of the Naomi arcade boards, to be far more versatile.  The <b>N</b>ew <b>A</b>rcade <b>O</b>peration <b>M</b>achine <b>I</b>dea was developed with both 2D and 3D in mind.  Boards were set up to process in parallel, so you could just add another board and increase processing power.  (and) Machines were fitted to read from GD-Roms, Sega's proprietary disc format.  GD-Roms were just normal CD-Roms except data was compacted together for optimal storage capacity.  A normal 700mb disc, could hold up to 1.2gb of data.</p><p>This was extremely flexible for the developers..  The could now produce discs to distribute their games, rather than cartridges..  something the console industry had already been doing at this time.</p><p>The Dreamcast is a lone Naomi board, squished into a plastic case, ready for sale to the mass public.  In 1998, Sega released both the Naomi boards and the Dreamcast in Japan.  (and then) The Dreamcast pretty much died in 2002.  Few games released, first party support dropped, and a very healthy alternative: Playstation 2.  However, it was their Naomi boards that continue to spur life on thanks to a healthy underground game genre.</p><div class='title'><b>Shmups</b></div><p>Shmups is an audible abbreviation for Shoot 'em ups, or Shooters.  Such famous shmups include 1941, Defender, Gallaga, Asteroids, Gradius..  Games that involve some sort of airplane or space ship, dodging enemy fire and other obstacles, while shooting up enemies.  Shmups were somewhat mainstream when gameplay and graphics were simply, but began to go underground when mainstream games began to offer more.</p><p>Anyways..  Shmup companies turned to the Naomi boards for their cheap development and production costs, as well as, ease of porting to a home console.  Shmup companies continued to develop Naomi games and subsequently release them on the Dreamcast even after the consoles death.  Since 2003, the Dreamcast has had 9 shmup releases: Shikigami no Shiro 2, Psyvariar 2, Border Down, Chaos Field, Trizeal, Radilgy, Under Defeat, Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica..  as well as some hentai releases.</p><p>These Dreamcast games would not have been possible if not for the Naomi boards and the devoted fans of the Shmup community.  In fact, such after death support began to reach enough demand for Sega to re-release some Dreamcast units in 2006, packaged with Radilgy.</p><p>Most of these after-death titles have been ported to other consoles, and thanks to O3 (Sega's unofficial private US publishing company) some have even come to the states.  Chaos Field was released in America in Feb 2005 on the Gamecube..  Currently, O3 is bringing over Radilgy on Gamecube posed to release at the end of April.  They renamed in Radio Allergy, though</p><div class='title'><b>The Dreamcast lives on..  kinda<br/></b></div><p>Man..  my Dreamcast has seen better days.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07979.webp" /></p><p>One day when I tried playing Crazy Taxi, the disc would scrape along the tray cover.  I took it upon myself to fix this problem..  so I took off the case, tightened some screws, and reassembled it.  Well...  the CD had plenty of room to spin around, but the Dreamcast always thought the tray was open.  When I reassembled it, the tray no longer hit the little lever in the back :/  Nothing a little tape won't fit.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07980.webp" /></p><p>To play import games on my Dreamcast, i need a boot disc.  Something that took about 5 minutes of googling, and another 5 minutes of burning to accomplish.  When completely screwed together, my Dreamcast thinks the tray is either closed or open..  It can't detect open/close functionality..  So i help it along..  no biggie.  Thus my Dreamcast looks like Dreamcastenstien.  It has life..!  I have given it life..!</p><p>Anyways...</p><p>Throughout my travels across the earth, across the country, and across the internet, I've found myself in the position of purchasing the 3 most recent Dreamcast games:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070415_dcshumps/DSC07978.webp" /></p><p>Under Defeat, Karous, and Trigger Heart Exelica, in order of release date..  After the Dreamcast Rerelease in 2006, They began publishing games with DVD style cases rather than CD cases.</p><p>So...  Are these games actually worth it?  well... here's what i think:</p><div class='title'><b>Under Defeat (Limited)</b></div><p>Originally released in early 2006, I found this game from <a href="http://www.ncsx.com/" title="http://www.ncsx.com/" title="http://www.ncsx.com/">National Console Support</a>.  I wasn't really sure if i was seeing it correctly, but they actually had copies of the Limited Edition version which came with the soundtrack.  I had heard Under Defeat was an amazing game, so i decided to order it.  Also, i think someone said the Limited version was super crazy rare, so that was also a deciding factor.</p><p>Under Defeat is developed by G.rev, which was founded by several Taito employees who had developed G Darius.  G.rev's notable works include Border Down, also on Dreamcast after its death.  G.rev is also noted for working with Treasure on their development of Ikaruga and Gradius V, two of the best shooters ever made.</p><p>Under Defeat does not disappoint.  You pilot a German attack helicopter in a modern version of World War II.  The helicopter will rotate right and left when you move allowing you to fire at an angle rather than straight on the whole time.  You get 3 bombs to start off with that launch an air strike upon the ground..</p><p>The little bit of innovation comes into, what they call, an option.  When you hold your fire long enough, a little green bar will fill up in the lower left hand corner.  When it flashes OK, you can begin firing again, and you'll release a little pod which will fire upon your opponents.  You can grab other power-ups that will change its weapon: Vulcan, Cannon and Rocket (from weakest and frequent to strongest and less frequent).</p><p>All kills this little guy acquires will net you double points.. and Therein lies the secret to obtaining massive points: Have the option kill as many high point gainers as possible..  especially laying the final blow on bosses.</p><p>The gameplay is very easy to pick up since it is rather basic..  The sounds and graphics add that extra icing on the cake that makes this game great fun.  The game plays 2D, but the graphics are in full 3D featuring rich textures and distinguishable colors and models to make enemies noticable and prominent.  Bullets are pretty easy to spot too.</p><p>Stylistically, smoke and explosions plays a extra role..  Whenever you fire a bullet a little bit of smoke emits from your cannon.  The Bullet flies through the air and hit your target with a little bit of smoke residue.  When enemies die, there's a little bit of pause as its engulfed in flames and bursts from explosion.  The fiery orange sparks from the enemy but is sharply over powered by black smoke.  The smoke stays in the air, and eventually fades away from the sky..   Sometimes, if you aren't heavily shooting up an enemy it'll blow up a little and fall to the earth underneath emitting a smoke trailed descent.  Another explosion results in the impact, with more smoke.</p><p>Under Defeat is an amazing joy to play, albeit just a little bit difficult.  I would definitely recommend any casual fan of the shooter genre to check out this game.  Much like Border Down, it will most likely stay on the Dreamcast, so if you do find a copy online for around $50, that will probably be the cheapest you'll get it for.</p><p>Buy from import retailers who support these companies by buying their products in the first place.  With out community support, we wouldn't even have these games at all.  In fact, Ncsx still has copies of the LE version in stock: http://www.ncsxshop.com/cgi-bin/shop/T-46704M.html  .. if you're a fan and you have the money, i'd say it's worth it.  Then you can say, "Yes..  i am responsible for the Dreamcast refusing to die."</p><div class='title'><b>More to come...</b></div><p>I'll get my impression of the Karous and Trigger Heart Exelica up in the next couple of days.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on April 15, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">April 11, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Takumi</h3><p class='img'><p>Over the weekend, Madison's newest Japanese Restaurant, Takumi, opened its' doors to the public:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07964.webp" /></p><p>Takumi is located on the east-side of Madison, right next to the Half-Price books, Noodles and Milios.</p><p>We arrived around 8pm, and walked right on in and were greeted by the waitressing staff, "irashaimase. ^_^"  That really threw me back for a second...  All the other Japanese restaurants I've been in Madison, have been very American in their service; however, none can really be compared to hearing "irashaimase" when you walk in the door.</p><p>Irashaimase is one of the most polite ways of saying, "welcome to our store" in Japanese.  If you enter any retail store in Japan, you'll hear the closest clerk to you say it.  (and) Then it has a domino effect throughout the rest of the employees of the store.  It reminds me of the 6 story 100-en store in Hamanomachi in Nagasaki (which is now closed when i went there over spring break).  If you perch yourself on the 3rd floor near the circling staircase and a new customer walks in, you'll hear, "Irashaimase" start on the 1st floor and trickled up by each of the clerks to the top floor.  It's very surreal.</p><p>Anyways, The place itself was very quaint. The had a bar, a sushi bar, a couple tables, and Tea Rooms towards the back.  We probably should've taken the Tea Room option, but went with the standard table.  We sat down and took a look at the menu.  Takumi primarily focuses on Sushi.  3 or 4 pages of their 8 page menu feature different entrees, combos, and single items.  The also had some hibachi, donburi, and bento.  We all ordered something different: Matt went with the hibachi, Leif and Steph went with a bento, I ordered sushi, and Zach also ordered sushi.</p><p>Takumi also had full Japanese sized beers in the favored Japan Brands: Asahi, Sapporo, and Kirin.</p><p>First, they brought us a sampler of their Ginger Salmon dish...  It was decent tasting, though the ginger was very overpowering.  It tasted like a standard Chinese American dish.  I suppose they were probably testing out their recipes, or something..</p><p>Next, they brought us our soups and salads and then came the main course.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07966.webp" /></p><p>I've never had better Sushi in my life.  The California Rolls were somewhat standard, but the Sashimi..  my god.  The salmon was full of flavor, full of meat, full of color..  so good.  The tuna was also fantastic, as was miscellaneous fish on the end.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/070410_takumi/DSC07965.webp" /></p><p>Leif and Steph's tempura bento was also quite tasty, as was Matt's salmon hibachi.  Takumi can definitely do fish.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Definitely better tasting than Ginza and Edo.</p><p>Though, with 2 beers, the tricolor entree, and a side of fried rice, my bill came out to $37.35..  The Tricolor Entree was about half the bill..  Beers were the other chunk..  Sushi is not without its cost.<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on April 11, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">April 8, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">SakuraCon @ Seattle, WA</h3><p class='img'><p>This weekend, Kyle, Jesse and Myself flew out to Seattle, WA to attend <a href="http://www.sakuracon.org/" title="http://www.sakuracon.org/" title="http://www.sakuracon.org/">Sakura-Con</a>, Seattle's premiere Anime Convention.</p><div class='title'><b>Background</b></div><p>One of the two days i've attending SPAMM this semester, Kyle queries, "say Dyre, Jesse and I were wondering if you'd be interested in flying out to Seattle for Sakura-Con this coming April."  I thought about it for a second, but that was all the time i needed before agreeing to their proposal.  "Hmmm...  that sounds like a great idea, there Kyle.  I'll definitely take a look into costs, planning and the like."</p><p>Going out to Seattle offered more than just an Anime convention.  SPAMM founders Ace and Jess had moved out there when Ace got a job working for Microsoft.  Also, another friend of ours, Hilary, lived in the 5 hour vicinity, too.  Plus, it's fricken Seattle.  I've wanted to go there ever since i graduated High School.  I'm not really sure how that came about..</p><p>Anywho, i got price quotes, hotel reservations, etc all set up.  Did a cost benefit analysis for our options, and everything seemed quite kosher.  Off we went.</p><div class='title'><b>Seattle, WA</b></div><p>I hardly did any research about what we were going to do in our downtime, but the little research i did just blew me away.  I had never actually looked at a map of Seattle, so i hit up google maps and <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=seattle,+wa&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=10&ll=47.52462,-122.244873&spn=0.666757,1.229095&om=1&iwloc=addr"> typed it</a> in.</p><p>My god.  Even from the plain maps, it looked beautiful.  Vast amounts of lakes and rivers, covered the terrain.

Seattle is all these things in one.</p><p>Once we landed, got our luggage, and rented a car, we set forth on the open roads.  The terrain was as green as it looked from the sky.  Despite the heavy amount of urbanization, Seattle maintained it's green roadside forests, and beautiful scenery, though the large shipyards took away from the natural scenery.  We drove up Hwy 5 towards downtown, but then took a detour East headed for Redmond.  The suburban areas kept itself grounded to the environment with heavy forests, mixed with houses, restaurants and other businesses.  We attempted to look for Microsoft Headquarters and Nintendo Headquarters, but were unable to trainspot them from the highway, nor the little suburban roundabout before heading back the direction we came.</p><p>Our cheap ass rental car felt like it was about to die, so we decided to get to the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=sheraton&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=12&om=1&iwloc=A"> hotel</a>, check-in, and then register for the Convention.</p><p>After doing such things, we got something to eat at The Islander in the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=pike+place+market&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.606395,-122.330832&spn=0.020804,0.038409&om=1"> Pike Market Place</a> area.  It was some of the most delicious shrimp I've ever tasted.  We walked around the Pike Market Place a little more afterwards, and then headed back to the hotel.  Then i slept for 14 hours.</p><div class='title'><b>Saturday Afternoon</b></div><p>Saturday, i finally got around to calling everybody and we met up with Hilary for lunch in the International District.  We ate at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A" title="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&q=fu-lin+chinese+restaurant&near=Seattle,+WA&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=15&ll=47.603935,-122.319846&spn=0.020805,0.038409&om=1&iwloc=A"> Fu-Lin Chinese Restaurant</a>, where the Ramen actually tasted like ramen from the Cafeteria at Nagasaki GaiDai in all of its' bland, rubbery, waxy, noodley, fatty, yet tasty flavor.  In the same area, just happened to be an import toy / video game / model / figure store, entitled <a href="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php" title="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php" title="http://www.pinkgodzillagames.com/pg_bam/seattle.php">Pink Godzilla</a>.  It's interesting to see how much these import stores hike up the prices for the 'demand' in America.</p><p>I did end up purchasing Trigger Heart Exelica on the Dreamcast, though.  There was about a $5 markup compared to the Japanese price, so it wasn't really that big a rip.</p><div class='title'><b>Cultural Divide</b></div><p>Something that rather surprised me was how large the Asian population is in Seattle.  Out here in Madison and up in Minneapolis, you'll catch a couple Asian Americans around.  Perhaps a couple more actual Asians in the South Union area, but the vast majority is Caucasian and African American.  In Seattle, there's a greater balance of the 3.</p><p>Obviously, since we're on the West coast, this is the original landing point for most Asian immigrants.  It's real interesting to see some customs that have transfered over and similarities between Japan in particular.</p><p>From what Ace and Jess told us about the weather, the lowest the temperature ever gets is around 35 to 40, and the highest it has gotten for them was around the 90s.  This weather is nearly identical to Nagasaki, according to what I've experienced and what #five has told me.</p><p>The garbage is far more recycling friendly as well.  In Japan, you separate burnable, non-burnable, bottles and cans when you throw away your trash.  All the public places I've been in around the west just have one single Garbage can that you dump everything into.  However, Seattle has garbage divisions much like Japan, separated by normal trash, paper, cans, and bottles.  Almost every public garbage can i saw had these four divisions.  No wonder the environment looks so damn beautiful.</p><p>Also, Seattle has quite a bit of Sakura and White Plum trees.  I was rather disappointed that i missed out on Sakura trees blossoming in Japan, but Seattle made up for it with its own blossoming beauties.  I'm not sure why i didn't take any pictures.. :/  I suppose the similar weather and immigrants were responsible for the healthy Sakura population around the city.</p><div class='title'><b>Sakura-Con</b></div><p>Anyways, Saturday was the day that we really spent our time at the Con, unless you count the hour and a half spent in line the previous day.

We walked around the dealer's room quite a bit.  Jesse not only got one of his Penny Arcade books signed by either Tycho or Gabe, but nearly defeated one of them in Puzzle Quest.  I also pissed off one of import game dealers commenting on his prices compared to those in Japan.</p><p>The gaming rooms were pretty disappointing.  Microsoft dominated one of the rooms with 360 stuff, while the other rooms had a ton of single player games.  Guilty Gear was the only traditionally fighting game present.  Dead or Alive 4 and, of course, Smash Brothers were the next closest :/  sadness...</p><div class='title'><b>As day turns to Night</b></div><p>All Saturday has been rather cloudy and rainy.  Ace and Jess confirmed that it did rain quite a bit, but never the down pours we experience in the Midwest.  The weather is usually overcast with a misty like rain that doesn't really get you wet..  So, you rarely get good beautiful days (like Friday), but you also rarely get snow, thunderstorms, and other severe weather.</p><p>After much decision making, we decided to go back to the fish Market, and go to Pike's place for dinner, where we had the most delicious meal of the trip.  I had stuffed Smoked Salmon with Spinach, along with several of their brewed beers.

Jesse was somewhat regretful that we didn't spend enough time at the Convention.  After all, that was our main reason of going to Seattle.  I think my whole time of going to Anime Conventions is coming to an end.  I'm really only interesting in what the dealers are selling, and what games are available in the game room.

The cosplayers were rather fantastic though.</p><p>One reason that <a href="http://nobrandcon.com/" title="http://nobrandcon.com/" title="http://nobrandcon.com/">No Brand Con</a> trumps all other Anime Conventions i've attended is their phenomenal game room, surprising vendors, and the 'No Mercy' room which plays Bad Anime and J-Drama.  Plus No Brand Con is at such a small scale that you actually meet people and see them throughout the weekend, rather than just once.</p><p>Even though it was just a simple weekend, i'll definitely be back up there for the <a href="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/" title="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/" title="http://www.pennyarcadeexpo.com/">Penny Arcade Expo</a> at the end of August.

When i first started buying DS games, i needed something to hold them in..  I mean, you can't carry around the game boxes because they're too bulky, and you can't carry the cartridge itself for fear of damage.  I first ran across <a href="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do" title="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do" title="http://www.circuitcity.com/ssm/ALS-Nintendo-DS-Game-Cases-NDS111/sem/rpsm/oid/147833/catOid/-16530/rpem/ccd/productDetail.do"><br/>these cases</a> at Best Buy and they worked great when i owned 6 or 7 games, but when my game library grew, i needed more room.</p><p>I looked far and wide, but could not find anything as compact and portable as those 3 game shells.  I came across something similar on the internet, which held 6 games instead of 3, but i could not find anywhere to purchase such game case.  When i first got to Japan, it was easy to find <a href="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html" title="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html" title="http://www.yodobashi.com/enjoy/more/i/cat_219_27774623_27775122_39464115/34340545.html">this great case</a>.  This case is AS compact as the 3 game case and also comes in different colors and the game snaps into the case, rather than float around with the 3 game case.</p><p>This still hadn't solved my problem though.  My DS library had gotten up to the 20 range, and 3 little 3-game cases and a 6-er wasn't going to hold all my games.</p><p>When i saw this 24 game case on CAG, it only took a little googling to find <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">their website</a> and <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU012">their product</a>.

My collection has gone beyond 24 games, so there's not much you can do there.  My 6 game case can still hold the games i'm using most often, since it's quite portable.

That huge mess of games has been consolidated down in one shiny penguin white and grey pack.  Just as easy to transport as my DS and my 6 pack.</p><p>I'd say that anyone with a decent amount of DS games, should definitely own one of these things.  It's rather appauling the most popular gaming system of 2006, and potentially of all-time, has dick for portable game storage to complement it's portable play.  It took independent game accessory maker, <a href="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/" title="http://penguinunited.com/">Penguin United</a> to solve this annoying problem finally.</p><p>After looking through their site a little more, i think i'll probably order this <a href="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011" title="http://penguinunited.com/proddetail.php?prod=PU_011">Wii-mote Charger Stand</a> next, since one of my Wii-motes has ran out of batteries, and i don't plan on buying new batteries each time this happens.</p><p>Wheee<br/></p></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on April 2, 2007<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">April 2007</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/ds-24-game-game-wallet">2</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/sakuracon-seattle-wa">8</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/takumi">11</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/end-gen-dreamcast">15</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/end-gen-dreamcast-2">16</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/indigo-prophecy">19</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/organization">25</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/enter-the-pidgin">30</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
