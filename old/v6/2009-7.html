But he completely skipped the Midwest!  Involver 2 was pretty cool, though. ^_^</p><p>Now that I have an iPod, I've been reacquainting myself with the music I have loved so much.  And then using that to springboard into music I've missed over the more recent years.  2003 Sasha to 2007 Sasha, 2008 and 2009.  I've been listening to it so much that I had hoped I would see him live rather soon.  It's rather fitting that he would be here a week after my birthday. ^_^</p><p>Definitely check out the following sets..  These are some of my favorites:</p><p>August 4th, 2002 // Essential Mix, Sasha @ Manumission, Priviledge, Ibiza<br/>June 27th, 2003 // Sasha @ Glastonbury 2003<br/>October 19th, 2003 // Sasha &amp; James Zabiela for Annie Nightengale<br/>August 11th, 2007 // Essential Mix, Sasha @ Cream, Amnesia, Ibiza<br/>July 31st, 2008 // Sasha @ Cream, Amnesia, Ibiza</p><p>Even since my introduction to Sasha through Wipeout 3 and Global Underground, I've been hooked.  For the most part, I've gone out of my way to catch him whenever he's nearby.  Except for one or twice, when I didn't know he was nearby or I was too busy with things.  As such, this will be my 8th time seeing him live (6th time solo).</p><p>April 24th, 2002 // Sasha + Digweed, Delta Heavy Tour @ The Quest, Minneapolis // <a href="/pages/sasha.htm" title="/pages/sasha.htm">text</a> &lt;-- god, horribly written.<br/>July 5th, 2003 // Sasha @ The Quest, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v6/sasha-the-quest" title="/sasha-the-quest">pics</a><br/>March 13th, 2004 // Sasha @ Visions, Chicago // <a href="/old/v6/sasha" title="/sasha">text</a>, <a href="/old/v6/sasha-vision-chicago" title="/sasha-vision-chicago">pics</a><br/>June 17th, 2004 // Sasha, Involver Tour @ Sound Bar, Chicago // <a href="/old/v6/sasha-soundbar-chicago" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago">pics</a><br/>October 26th, 2004 // Sasha @ Club Escape, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v6/sasha-escape-minneapolis" title="/sasha-escape-minneapolis">pics</a><br/>June 10th, 2005 // Sasha, Fundacion Tour @ Sound Bar, Chicago // <a href="/old/v6/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2" title="/sasha-soundbar-chicago-2">pics</a><br/>April 16th, 2008 // Sasha + Digweed, Spring Tour @ Epic, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v6/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">post</a> <a href="/old/v6/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis" title="/sasha-digweed-epic-minneapolis">pics</a></p><div class='title'><b>Digweed</b></div><p>I've seen Digweed a couple times, aside from the times listed above w/ Sasha.</p><p>August 24th, 2004 // John Digweed @ Club Escape, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v6/digweed-escape-minneapolis" title="/digweed-escape-minneapolis">pics</a><br/>March 9th, 2007 // John Digweed @ Myth, Minneapolis // <a href="/old/v6/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">post</a> <a href="/old/v6/digweed-myth-minneapolis" title="/digweed-myth-minneapolis">pics</a></p><p>I find it really amazing who their sound changes from when they DJ solo and when they DJ together.</p><div class='title'><b>Armin, Tiesto</b></div><p>Armin is pretty sweet, but Tiesto is a bit of joke.

He's always been close to the dance scene.  In fact, in his earlier years, didn't he frequently DJ?  Wikipedia doesn't seem to think so, but I thought I heard something about that.</p><p>My fandom for Moby doesn't go way back to his beginning.  I started paying attention to his music when some of his tracks started showing up in compilations.  In 1999, he released Play which I liked.  I fell in love with 18 in 2002.  That Summer in 2002 was the first time I had a chance to see Moby live, but I blew it because I thought $50 was too expensive for tickets.  It's still somewhat expensive, but Paul Oakenfold was there too.  (Edit: Actually it was Summer 2001 for the Area One Tour)</p><p>I've been a fan every since.  I loved Hotel.  I listened to it everyday throughout the summer of 2005.  Up until that point, I had seen all my favorite musicians and groups live, but Moby was ever elusive.  He'd either not tour in the Midwest, or I'd hear about it after the fact.</p><p>To this day, Moby is still my favorite musician who I've not seen live.</p><div class='title'><b>DJing</b></div><p>But anyways, back to the point.  In 2008, Moby released an album entitled Last Night.  It was a correspondence to all his memories DJing the previous several months.  It was a very chill but upbeat album.  It was great to flip on and lounge to. ^_^</p><p>So when he started touring a little more extensively as a DJ last year, I really wondered what his live sets would actually sound like.  On August 2nd, 2008, I had my chance.  It was my chance to not only see Moby live for the first time, but to listen to him DJ!  I was pretty excited.</p><p>However, those plans were dashed by a prior engagement (literally).  It was the same date as my good friend Erika's wedding, of which I was part of.  Even though Moby was a mere 2 hours away in downtown Chicago, it was not my fate.  That night, I did not belong in Moby's audience.</p><div class='title'><b>Wait for Me</b></div><p>A couple of weeks ago, Moby released his newest album, <b>Wait for me</b>.  Unfortunately, I don't really like it.  Play, 18, Hotel, Last Night all had a playful inspired energy.  Wait for me is a pretty depressive anti-war album that really doesn't appeal to me.</p><p>But, with Wait for Me, Moby is back into song writing and playing music rather than DJing.  He's become pretty political over the past year which has taken him out of the clubs and into the studio.  So, my chance to see him DJ has passed for now.</p><p>That is...  until yesterday.</p><div class='title'><b>Essential Mix</b></div><p>Thank god for Radio 1 and Pete Tong.  During the Ultra Music Festival last year, they recorded Moby's set on stage with Carl Cox.  After coming across a torrent from this set, I quickly downloaded it and had the pleasure of listening to it today on the bus!</p><p>Moby's Essential Mix set is pretty interesting.  It's incredibly high energy.  I knew that there was no way he'd play anything but House music, but I thought it would be a little more progressive and ambient given his album background.  If you had me listen to this set and afterward told me this was Moby, I would be shocked.</p><p>But there could be two major factors in play here.</p><p>1) This is the Ultra Music Festival.  DJs don't fuck around when it comes to Miami in Spring.  They bring their A game to the table, and cater to the 10,000 music lovers hopping around in the tent.  The music feeds off the crowd just as the crowd feeds off the music.  It's wildly intense, so it stands to reason that if he were playing House music, it would be incredibly energetic.</p><p>2) He's playing on stage with Carl Cox.  Carl Cox is known for incredibly energetic sets.  With Moby's set leading into Carl Cox, Moby has to bring the energy up to the level of Carl Cox.  So there's a little of that too.</p><p>I was super happy that the 3 or 4 ending tracks were all remixes of previous Moby songs. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>A True Moby set?</b></div><p>But, I have to ask myself, "Is this a true Moby set? When Moby DJs, is this really his sound?"  I'm not entirely convinced.  Again, it would've been nice to see him in Chicago last year to have some context, but that's not fair to Erika to complain about it.</p><p>The DVD packaged with 18: The B-sides, has Moby's entire live performance at Glastonbury 2003. This performance is exactly what I would picture Moby live.  It's a pretty mellow and vibrant performance.  This is the kind of rich ambient energy I was expecting from his DJ set.  It's really weird...</p><div class='title'><b>Finally!!</b></div><p>The day has finally come!!  These past ten years of listening to Moby, striving to hear him live, will finally come to light.  On September 30th, Moby will be touring through Chicago for "Wait for Me" which is pretty awesome.</p><p>But!  He'll be @ Myth, Minneapolis the day after on Thursday October 1st.  I think it's finally time to scratch off one of my life goals.  And it probably won't be anything like how I expect it to be. ^_^</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 23, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 21, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Trainspotting</h3><p>Throughout my life, I can count a number of cultural keystones that have dramatically shaped my tastes and perceptions.  Keystones in the form of music, movies, television, video games and combinations of these forms of entertainment.</p><p>Around 1995 was when I finally heard that pulsing electronic sound that has been with me every since.  I heard it on television from MTV's Amp.  I heard it from video games in Wipeout XL.  I heard it in the movies from Hackers.  Drowning in a raging auditory ocean of Rock, Pop, Country, Oldies, this distant dynamic sound was so completely different.  Once I heard these tracks and that sound, I knew I had found music that was for me.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple years later that I discovered Sasha and other DJs that really opened my eyes and ears to the Electronic Music genre as a whole.  But for a time, I had a couple songs that were my own.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Had I seen <b>Trainspotting</b> back in my youth, it probably would've been sitting alongside those I mentioned earlier.  Trainspotting is very rich in music, character, life, satire..  There's some amazing camera shots, and scene transitions..  This movie has it all.</p><p>10 years ago, I would've watched this movie again and again, dissected every scene, put meaning to the randomness, placed myself in character's shoes..  But today, I'm just along for the ride.  Trainspotting oozes with Youth, especially seeing a young Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Johnny Lee Miller, and Kelly MacDonald run around in their low to mid 20s.</p><p>The music and the faces bring me back 10 years to the mid-ish 90s.  Young and ripe.  It's the same feeling I get whenever I pop in Hackers or listen to Atom Bomb, Papua New Guinea, Cowgirl, Halcyon.. (by Fluke, Future Sound of London, Underworld, Orbital).</p><p>I'm not sure if anyone else's brain works this way, but a specific melody or tune can bring back the most vibrant memories of my past than words or stories.  Whenever I hear Atom Bomb, I'm instantly transported back to my room at age 16ish watching Amp on MTV's around 2 in the morning.  Whenever I hear the Facility background music from Goldeneye 007, I'm instantly transported to Justin's Mom's house in Wayzata playing N64 with him around 11pm after working at Toys R Us for the night.</p><p>I guess the same works with images too, but it's not as powerful as hearing.  It's a powerful touchstone at a singular point in my life that can always be revived by that distinctive sound.</p><div class='title'><b>Trainspotting</b></div><p>Anyways, I'm sure I would've loved this movie If I saw it back then.  But better late than never, I suppose. ^_^.</p><p>As mentioned before, Ewan McGregor is the main star of this movie, who has gone on to be young Obi-wan Kenobi in the Star Wars Pre-Trilogy.  Kelly MacDonald is in this movie too!  In fact, it's her very first role in a movie.  She's the wife in No Country for Old Men.  Also, Paige Marshall in Choke.</p><p>Also, Trainspotting is directed by Danny Boyle, whom you might know as the director of Slumdog Millionaire.  He also directed 28 Days Later.</p><p>It's also interesting that almost all the actors in Trainspotting are actually scottish, except for Johnny Lee Miller.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 21, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 16, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Xtro</h3><p>About a week ago, I saw one of the cheesiest, most bizarre movies I've ever seen, Xtro.  I have no idea how I came across this title.  Nor do I know how it became to exist in my Netflix queue.  But, I'm quite glad that I had the pleasure of viewing this treasure.</p><p>Xtro is ultimately about a boy.  Little Tony is scarred at a young age by the disappearance of his father, Sam.  They were out for an ordinary game of catch, when POOF!  Aliens appear from beyond the mountains and abduct Sam.  Alone, Tony grieves for his loss.  Returning home, no one believes him.  Those who don't know the truth believe that Sam had run away from his responsibilities as a father.  The aliens couldn't have picked a worse time to intervene as things hadn't really been going well at home.</p><p>3 years later, things have actually turned out better for everyone except Tony.  His mother is now with a cool hunky photographer.  They live in downtown London where all the magic happens.  Tony has a super hot babysitter who gets naked several times throughout the film.</p><p>Unfortunately, Tony has recurring nightmares of his father's abduction.  He wakes throughout the night from his own screams and whimpers.  Alas, his mother still does not believe him.  "Quite whining and shut up about that ridiculous lie.  He left us!"  She would say as she burst into his room, afterward returning to her bed with her super-fly boyfriend.</p><p>Meanwhile, in the forests outside of London the aliens return!  They appear above the trees and deposit an odd creature.  An infantile organism that begins to adapt and move across the forest bed...  it finds the smooth pavement of a nearby road, and then suddenly finds the bumper of an oncoming car.  Shocked by ramming such a weird looking animal, the automobile stops and its occupants search for the wounded being.  Of course, the alien finds them first.</p><p>Meanwhile, later, the alien finds itself upon a cabin in the woods with a lone female occupant.  You may guess what might happen next.  Bow-chicka-wow-wow...  The alien impregnates the woman and runs off.  Never to be seen in the film again.  Startled by such an event, the young woman is dazed but then feels the fetus inside her.</p><p>The fetus rapidly grows and...  here's a clip of what happens next as she gives birth...  [find it on youtube]</p><p>It's Sam!  Sam is back from outer space and ready to relive his life as Tony's father.  Of course he doesn't actually remember being abducted.</p><p>As you might expect, drama occurs, then murder, then boobs, then it gets weird.</p><div class='title'><b>Spoilers</b></div><p>Ultimately, Sam's purpose for return was to retrieve Tony.  But in order for Tony to adapt to space travel, he must under go a transformation process.  Sam bestows the power to overcome adaption to space.  As the power matures inside of Tony, he gains the power to materialize his hallucinations. But ultimately, he's taken over by the power's control.</p><p>Tony's first order of business is to create a friend.  The friend that he's always wanted!  A creepy clown midget will do.  Next!  Kill all my annoying neighbors with life sized versions of my toys.  Kill my asshole step dad.  Kill that asshole elderly woman, downstairs.  Kill the hot naked babysitter for some reason.  Actually, wait a minute.  Don't kill her.  Knock her out.  Mutate her womb.  And then collect the alien eggs she produces.  Next!  Tip over the refrigerator.  Fill it with Guacamole.  And use it as an incubator for more aliens.  The perfect plan!</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam lures Mom back to the forest.  Tony appears.  And off they go to Never Never Land.  Leaving the mom a wake of bodies and loneliness on earth.</p><p>The end.</p><div class='title'><b>Bold!</b></div><p>I wish the Science Fiction movies of today had the bizarre spin of movies from the late 70s, early 80s.  Has there been a horror movie in the past 5 or 10 years that has made you cringe and yell out, "Oh my god?!"  I think Hostel has really been the only one I can think of.  And maybe Event Horizon to an extent.</p><p>Why aren't movies this bold anymore?</p><p>Actually, now that I think of it...  Asian torture films as of late have been quite brutal.  Audition was one of the most difficult films to stomach (so to speak).  That film is painful.  Maybe I should watch more of those...</p><div class='title'><b>Moog!</b></div><p>Besides the unbridled gore, wacky retro outfits and attitudes, Xtro has an amazing soundtrack.  In fitting with the late 70s, early 80s, the score is entirely composed with a Moog Synthesizer.  The Moog synth is vital in setting the tone of the movie consistent with the era in which is was produced.  A very organic sound with an outright alien tynch.  Atmospheric tone standing on the brink of technology.</p><p>Xtro is bizarre enough for me to love to begin with, but the beautiful crafted soundtrack keeps me locked in with the experience.</p><div class='title'><b>The end...?</b></div><p>The ending of the <b>Xtro</b> is left open.  There are some alternate endings on the DVD, but ultimately the alien eggs hatch and you're left to figure out what happens next.</p><p>There are two sequels following Xtro, but have absolutely nothing to do with the original movie, nor each other.  Both sequels feature military teams combating an alien menace.  Xtro 2 (released in 1990) is an Alien ripoff, and Xtro 3 (released in 1995) is a Predator ripoff.  Both films are god awful.  Neither has nudity.  Neither has grotesque horror.</p><p>Everything unique about Xtro 1 was completely generic in its sequels.  The story.  The characters.  The setting.  The action.  The circumstances.  The music.</p><p>Xtro 1 was pretty low budget, but they made up for it with imagery you'd never see anywhere else.  Xtro 2 and 3 are wannabe copies of blockbuster films that try to bring the franchise back into reality.  They are not bold, nor eye catching.  They are sad imitations that I regret ever watching.</p><p>Anyways, definitely check out <b>Xtro</b> on Netflix, but forget about the sequels.</p><p>Also, I swiped that Clip from <a href="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/" title="http://www.badmovies.org/othermovies/xtro/">Badmovies.org's Review of Xtro</a>.

They carry clothes, toys, movies and, of course, video games.  In fact, the PX is a gold mine for video games.  The PX has many games that time forgot.  And since the general populous cannot shop at the PX, it keeps the riff-raff out and the supply high.</p><p>What's really weird is the huge surplus of games published by Atlus.  Atlus is a North American publisher that spends a lot of time and attention on presentation and limited edition releases of their games.  They generally publish a lot of RPGs, including their own super-popular RPG series, Shin Megami Tensei.  SMT has been getting a lot of buzz over here thanks to Persona.</p><p>This <b>surplus</b> includes recent releases, such as Dark Spire, Knights of the Nightmare, Devil Summoner 2, Hammerin' Hero, Crimson Gem Saga...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4294.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4294.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4294.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4296.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4296.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4296.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4300.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4300.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4300.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4304.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4304.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4304.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4306.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4306.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4306.webp"  /></p><p>Some not-so recent releases, such as Super Robot Taisen, Legacy of Y's, Arcana Heart..</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4297.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4297.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4297.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4298.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4298.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4298.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4307.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4307.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4307.webp"  /></p><p>And some releases from a while ago that are actually difficult to find...  such as Stella Deus, Digital Devil Saga 2, Persona 3 LE, and Growlanser Heritage of War.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4301.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4301.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4301.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4302.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4302.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4302.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4299.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4299.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4299.webp"  /></p><p>Actually, I think it's pretty amazing they have these old games there, especially Digital Devil Saga 2.  I would buy every single one of these games, except the PX sells them for MSRP.  Every PS2 game is $50, every PSP game $40, and every NDS game $35.  It's a treasure trove, but at a cost!</p><p>So that's probably why they still have so many copies of these games.  Why buy a $50 PS2 game that full of pussy Japanese bullshit, when I can buy a badass FPS for the Xbox 360 for only $10 more?!  Riddle me that, civilian!</p><p>Anyways, as you can see in these pictures, they don't have just a few copies of these games in stock.  They have a whole bunch of copies.  And it's not just this PX too.  When Justin was stationed in North Carolina, I picked up copies of Devil Summoner 1 and Shin Megami Tensei Nocturne.  Both of which are Atlus published (and developed) games.</p><p>I find it really odd that these military posts have such a huge surplus of these games.  And!  That no one on-base buys any of them.  You'd think the rules of Supply and Demand would be enforced here, but they aren't.  The next time I return to Florida to visit Justin, there will be just as many Atlus games as there were on this trip.  It's really odd.</p><p>They need to put all their Atlus titles on sale or clearance or something.  Hopefully when they do, it'll be the same weekend I'm down there.  My half.com store will have a glut of fantastic games, again!</p><div class='title'><b>Not just Atlus</b></div><p>Atlus is the most prominently published games, but there are plenty of other unappreciated titles on those shelves.</p><p>There were copies of Okami, God Hand, Soul Nomad, and Rhapsody.Â   There were copies of other NIS games, too.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4305.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4308.webp"  /><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4303.webp"  /><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/090704_atlus/IMG_4295.webp"  /></p><p>If you happen to know someone in our Armed Forces, visit them and take a look at the video game stock at their PX.
