If it took me at least 60 hours for me to reach the end, then I fully felt like I got my money's worth.  I felt cheated if I bought a game only to beat it a mere 10 hours later.  With games running up a bill of $50 or $60, it was too much to spend on something that would only keep my attention for no more than a week.</p><p>But, things change...</p><div class='title'><b>Games have changed</b></div><p>Back in the day, the only games that made me feel something were those that had enough time to build character.  RPGs and Adventure games took me on a long journey.  I met new characters, and helped them sort out their lives.  Which in turn, let my own character learn more about themselves.  Given the amount of time spent with the characters, I grew attached to them and the story started to mean something to me.  I cared about what happens for more than just curiosity sake.  I want my characters to succeed, fall in love, and overcome their heart ships.</p><p>Other games, like 1st person shooters and action games, didn't have the capacity for passion.  It was more about the fun you had playing the game.  Which is perfectly fine, of course.  But for me, most games feel incredibly empty if they aren't engaging me on an emotional level.</p><p>I don't find that's the case anymore.  The game industry has matured to the point where a game nearly fails if it doesn't connect to the player on an emotional level.  It's boring if the characters an empty shells and have no humanity.  Having an interesting story with engaged characters is as pivotal to success as making sure the game works to begin with.</p><p>Games like <b>Uncharted 2</b>, <b>Batman Arkham Asylum</b>, <b>Brutal Legend</b>, <b>Shadow of the Colossus</b>, <b>Fatal Frame</b>, <b>Bioshock</b>, <b>Dead Space</b> are all ones that will take someone no longer than 10 or 15 hours to complete.  You can easily complete the game throughout the course of a weekend.  And within that time is an incredibly rich experience.  Just as rich as any Legend of Zelda or Final Fantasy.</p><p>In fact, I find these games much more engaging <em>because</em> they won't take up longer than a weekend.</p><div class='title'><b>I have changed</b></div><p>I graduated college 3 years ago, and have worked almost every day since.  My weekday is spent thoughtfully thinking about elegant solutions to complex and interesting problems.  It's spent building applications and maintaining them.  I don't have time to think about some game that I'm in the middle of playing.  It really ends up being a distraction.</p><p>In my spare time, I do more than just game.  I sell things on eBay.  I hang out with friends.  I try and fail to meet girls.  I listen to music.  I go to clubs.  I go to other events on the weekends and sometimes during the week.  I meet people for dinner.  I read, though not often.  I shop for games, and sometimes other things.  And plenty of other crap.  And usually afterward, I write about the more interesting things.  Plus, there are other games to play.</p><p>Finishing a game within a weekend gives me the perfect opportunity to completely devote myself to it.  I usually won't have any distractions at all, unless I meet up with some friends at a bar on Saturday night.  Once I wake up on Sunday, I can sit in front of the TV all day and think about nothing else.</p><p>Without any real distractions, I get more out of the game.  I experience it all from start to finish.  And then I usually reflect by writing something about it.  (Unless the game really didn't mean anything, afterall).  A free weekend is perfectly suited for a game, but if it starts spilling into the week it starts eating into time I can, should, or want to do something else.</p><div class='title'><b>Dragon Age</b></div><p>Dragon Age has been the first game I've played in a while that exceeds 20 hours, and it's really annoying.  I've only been able to play the game in 10 hour chunks here and there, and it's almost been a month since I started.  Many of my friends have actually finished the game well before me.  It really feels like it's been dragging on and on.  Though, the game does splinter off in different directions that aren't very well connected, so it's hard to hold on to all the story at once.</p><p>In the beginning, I was gun-ho! about playing the game through a second time, but there's no way I'd find the time.  I might take a look at some of the other Origin stories, but I think they'll feel empty to me.</p><p>Dragon Age is all about the character I made and have spent these 45 hours with.  She may not say a word of dialog throughout the game, but she has actually changed.  Or rather, I have changed the character I portray.</p><div class='title'><b>My Story</b></div><p><em>(I went the path of the Female Human Nobel or Warrior Princess named Rikki.)</em></p><p>After my kingdom had been destroyed and my family slain by Howe, I was a mean, sad little girl.  I was rude to others, and even killed those who were unfortunate because I didn't care.  I thought it was funny with the little power I had over them.</p><p>But then I met Lelianna.  Someone who deep down used to do what I was doing, but was now I devote religious person.  I didn't care much for the religion, but it made sense to actually act with the grace and nobility that ran through my blood.  I took Lelianna as an example, and throughout the course of our adventures came quite close.</p><p>Alistair, Morrigan, Lelianna, and I went across the land of Fereldan and continued our quest to unite the land.  I learned all about my friend's pasts.  Lelianna and I fell in love I suppose.  Once we ended this blight, we would disappear together.  We would travel the world and see everything there is to see.</p><p>We discovered Alistair's little secret.  He was incredibly reluctant, but he's actually King Calyn's brother and first in line for the Throne of Fereldan.  I could hardly believe it, but Alistair did nothing but whine about it.  He and I talked about a bit and I think I talked some sense into him.  We talked a lot, and he's actually pretty funny.</p><p>Once we reunited our lands, it was time to face that fucker Loghain.  But to truly unite Fereldan, we'd need a King.  Alistair would have to take the throne.  We faced Loghain and totally overthrew him.  It was now my decision between Alistair and Loghain's daughter.  OOOoOhhHHHhhhh..  but what is this?  I can use my persuasion, marry Alistair right now, and become Queen!  Hell yeah!</p><p>Not soon after I made my decision, Alistair really assumed the role as King.  He truly became a great man, and the best character in the whole game.  I'm sorry about having lead on Lelianna, but Alistair had validated my decision and my future is with him.</p><p>And now I'm heading into the final battle to defeat the Archdemon and save the world from this Blight.  After a full month of preparing, this will finally be over.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on December 16, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">December 14, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Dexter Season 4 Finale</h3><p>This season has been fantastic.  Normally, once Premium Channel TV shows (HBO, Showtime) start to become stale, they don't return.  Sopranos, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, and other great shows start off incredibly strong.  But after Season 2 of Sopranos, Six Feet Under, and Deadwood after Season 1, they completely fall to ruin.  They either forget what made them a success or can't figure out how to hold on to it.</p><p>Once I finished watching Dexter Season 3, I thought, "This is it.  Dexter is over."  Season 3 went in random directions at times, and ignored the success of Seasons 1 and 2.  Dexter didn't kill anyone for himself.  He didn't learn anything (other than the overall lesson of the season).  It had no personality, in my opinion.</p><p>Season 4 broke this stale curse.  It wasn't some dull misdirected meaningless story.  It's own self-contained story of the Trinity killer was interesting enough.  He was the first truly horrific serial killer.  Dexter saw him as a mentor, and a friend, but Trinity's demons could not be contained.  The writers weaved him into the Dexter mythos and with it brought more than just a lesson learned.</p><div class='title'><b><i>SPOILERS</i></b></div><p>Now with Rita murdered as a Trinity victim, and Deb confronting Dexter about Brian Moser, I think Dexter has run out of excuses.  It annoys me how everyone just believes Dexter when he makes up these flimsy excuses, and no one thinks anything else of it.  I guess this is what happens when you kill off Doukes, the only person to actually question Dexter about what he's doing.  </p><p>Thank god Deb has started assuming this role and actually asked Dexter about his peculiar appearance at the raid on Arthur Mitchel's house.  I hope her role in Season 5 eventually leads to realization.</p><p>With Dexter only renewed through Season 5, currently, I wonder if the writers will end Dexter.  Business-wise it would be a stupid move.  The Season 4 Finale is the most watched episode of any Showtime original series with 2.6 million viewers.  But Story-wise, it would make Dexter incredibly tight.  It would never reach the point of being stale.</p><p>When Deb actually verifies the demon inside of Dexter, where would the show go from there anyways?</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on December 14, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">December 7, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Youge (洋ゲー)</h3><p>Over the past 3-4 years gaming has changed considerably.  In 2005, the Xbox 360 was released, and then in 2006, the Playstation 3 and Wii were released.  Obviously, we're in a new era of gaming with which consoles are on the market, but the considerable change has been the paradigm shift from Japan's dominance in game development to Western.  And by Western, I mean Europe and North America, the "western" civilizations.</p><p>From Nintendo's "splash" in America in 1985 with <b>Super Mario Bros.</b>, and later with <b>Legend of Zelda</b>, and <b>Metroid</b> and Sega's <b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b>, Western development had been behind the curve.  Maybe because we never really thought of gaming as a mature medium.  Most western games were lower quality copies of their Japanese counterparts, while Nintendo and Sega were iterating on their ideas.  Capcom created <b>Mega Man</b> and <b>Street Fighter</b>, Konami created <b>Castlevania</b>.</p><p>There were definitely a couple games that were born in Western game development that established genres as well.  ID created <b>Wolfenstein </b>and <b>Doom</b>, Westwood created <b>Command &amp; Conquer</b>, and Blizzard created <b>Warcraft</b>.  But these First Person Shooters and Real Team Strategy games were absolutely foreign to Japan.  There is something distinct and exclusive to Japanese culture that I'm not sure anyone has ever defined.  If something foreign does not resonate with these ideals it will not be adopted.</p><p>Japan is also incredibly nationalistic and narcisistic at times.  It's only natural that when they're on their game, they become full of themselves.  I'm sure this is where the term <b>Youge</b> originated its discriminatory meaning.</p><div class='title'><b>Youge</b></div><p>Youge literally translates as Western Game.  "You-" (<span class='ja'>洋</span>) is the prefix for Western things, and Ge is short for Geemu (<span class='ja'>ゲーム</span>) or Game.  It's discriminatory double meaning has been born out of their dominance and disregard for Western game development.</p><p>From their 20 year dominance over game development, Western Games have been seen as second class in Japan.  32-bit era games and last-gen games like <b>Metal Gear Solid</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time</b>, <b>ICO</b>, <b>Shadow of the Collosus</b>, <b>Okami</b>, <b>Final Fantasy VII </b>and <b>Final Fantasy X </b>did things with story and gameplay that truly brought maturity to gaming.</p><p>For me, everyone of those games I've gotten emotionally attached to.  I cared for the characters and story.  There wasn't any game that came from the Western side of things that made me feel anything beyond the normal enjoyment of the game.</p><p>But that began changing with the Xbox.  Western developers now had a video game platform outside of the PC, and began taking some of Japan's ideas as their own.  Games like <b>Grand Theft Auto 3</b>, <b>Halo</b>, <b>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</b>, and <b>Prince of Persia Sand of Time </b>were mature products that had mass appeal but were uniquely Western.</p><p>In today's era, there have been an incredibly few Japanese games that have done anything interesting. <b> Dead Rising</b>, <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b>, <b>Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess </b>and <b>Super Mario Galaxy </b>are just about it.  They stand along-side far more Western games such as <b>Halo 3</b>, <b>Mass Effect</b>, <b>Oblivion</b>, <b>Bioshock</b>, <b>Grand Theft Auto 4</b>, <b>Dead Space</b>, <b>Fallout 3</b>, <b>Batman Arkham Asylum</b>, and <b>Dragon Age</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japan needs to get over it</b></div><p>Kotaku had an article this morning translating Youichi Wada's (CEO of Square Enix) news report about their upcoming release of <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b> and the recent worldwide release of <b>Modern Warfare 2</b> (<a href="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory" title="http://kotaku.com/5420421/square-enix-president-calls-western-game-label-terribly-discriminatory">here</a>).  He says that Japan needs to get over this discriminatory meaning.  Western games are truly leading the world, and Japan has got to face facts and recognize their success.</p><p>Wada isn't the only one.  Keiji Inafune said the exact same thing during Tokyo Game Show this year, exclaiming, <a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/" title="http://www.joystiq.com/2009/09/27/keiji-inafune-says-japanese-game-industry-is-over-man/">Japan is over. We're done. Our game industry is finished.</a>"  Evolve or die.</p><p>Final Fantasy XIII will definitely be a test for Japan.  Will a game that pure Japanese have the worldwide appeal that it's had in the past?  Will XIII inspire game development the way VII and X have before?  I really wonder if I'll enjoy it having given up on Japanese RPGs.</p><p>I think the only other games worth mentioning on Japan's horizon are <b>The Last Guardian </b>and <b>Legend of Zelda Wii</b>.  Everything else is just an unoriginal copy-cat.</p><div class='title'><b>The Rise and Fall of Japan</b></div><p>Also, 1up has an amazing article from Sept 2008 about <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938" title="http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3169938">The Rise and Fall (and Rise?) of Japan</a> that explains all this far better than I attempted.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways, The Japanese have a word for it!</b></div><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on December 7, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">December 6, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Dragon Age &amp; Difficulty v. Challenge</h3><p>Before getting a chance to play Dragon Age, one thing that several people mentioned about the game was it's difficulty.  "This game is hard!" exclaimed Nick Breckon of Idle Thumbs, "I've died so many times."  A friend of mine also concurred saying that he's died a whole lot in the game as well.  In both cases, they switched the difficulty down to easy just to make it through the game.  These people aren't novice video game players by any means, but was definitely curious.</p><p>Dragon Age is a game where your character has a few different classes to choose from.  You go about the game with a party of character that are different classes as well.  The game has 3 main classes to choose from: Warrior, Rogue and Mage.  And that's typical the order of how complex each character class is.  Warrior's are dirt simple.  You just walk up to an enemy and keep beating on it until it's dead.  Rogues are a little more tricky because they aren't designed for brute strength.  And Mages are typically the most complex because you have many spells to choose from.</p><p>It came as no surprise to me that all the talk I've heard about the game's difficulty were from people playing as a Rogue or a Mage.  Apparently if you're not playing the game to its fullest, it'll kick your ass.  This is why when presented with the choice of class, I went with the Warrior.  I don't want the game to be difficult to the point of frustration.  But I'm still not going to give the game the satisfaction of playing on Easy.</p><p>As playing a Warrior, I've found the game to be pretty damn easy, actually.  I haven't messed around with Tactics.  I accidentally spent my skill points on things that aren't useful.  I'm not paying attention to talents.  I haven't really tweaked anything to fight the most efficient fight.  I was almost never saving on my own.  And I'm still kicking ass, so I guess I must be doing something right.</p><p>At 15 hours into the game I experience my first death, and another hour later I ran into an actual challenge thanks to the Mage Circle.  But my deaths and problems were simply because I was going into the battle without thinking.  At this point the game had trained me to think any battle could be easily won.  For the first time, I had to change the way I approached the battle.  It only took me a couple minutes to utilize the shape shifting you have in the Mage Circle to defeat this cluster of mages and be on my way.</p><p>The game was still pretty much a cake walk until I came across Kolgrim today.  This phoney Spartan was actually the first real challenge I've face in this game.  My tactics of rushing into battle had no effect.  Even focusing on one enemy at a time ended in failure.  For the first time in the game, I was actually stuck.  There was no way I was going to work with Kolgrim and whatever quest he was on.  With the choices I wanted for my story, I would have to fight him and defeat him.</p><p>So, I started actually learning how to play the game correctly.  I looked into all the skills and talents for the first time, I had for my characters and came up with a battle plan that actually used them.  I looked at each character's tactics for the first time, too.  They were all defaults as aggressive to fight the nearest opponent.  What good is that going to do?  If my entire party focused on one enemy at a time, we can get rid of the weaker guys right away and only have Kolgrim left to deal with.</p><p>After just messing around with the options and coming up with an actual plan of attack, I had gotten far further in the battle than I had before.  Learning what the game has to offer, and utilizing it is the real difference between hitting buttons on the control and actually playing the game.  <b>If Dragon Age is "hard", then you're playing it wrong.</b></p><p>Unlike other RPGs, Dragon Age isn't some mindless level grind to overcome your strife.
