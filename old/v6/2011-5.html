Noire Impressions</h3><p>Watchin' Faces, Solvin' Cases.</p><p>I got L.A.Noire in the mail last night, and couldn't help myself but play a few hours and introduce myself to Rockstar's newest title.</p><p>I went through all the "tutorial" missions, and completed my first full case. The tutorials were rather linear and localized. Once I got to the first case, the world really opened up, and the GTA nature of Rockstar games came to light. After completing the first case, the next case started immediately, which was somewhat dissapointing. It felt very linear, but maybe later on they'll give you a choice of different cases to follow and accomplish.</p><p>When solving a case, you most collect evidence from the crime scene, interview witnesses, and follow the clues. The clues will bring you to different locations in 1947 Los Angeles, and the case continues to unfold. The first case ended rather predictably, and there really wasn't much variation. Though, I'm sure that later cases will have multiple valid endings.</p><p>It's actually pretty fun. It's very much in the same vain of your Ace Attorney titles, except completely presented as an open world Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>I was somewhat bored with it last night, but the more and more I think about it this morning, the more and more I want to return to the world of Cole Phelps.<br/>____</p><p>It's pretty similar to Heavy Rain. You definitely do a lot of the same things in the same manor, such as interrogation and crime scene searching, but it doesn't feel the same. I'm not really sure why...</p><p>Crime scene searching is nearly identical. As you walk around, the controller will vibrate if there's a clue nearby. Your character picks it up, and can twist and twirl it around to look for specifics. If it's relevant, you make a note of it in your crime log. These clues can be used as evidence later on when interrogating people.</p><p>Interrogations involve a list of questions in your crime book. You ask a question, and the person gives a response. You have 3 options. You either believe them (truth), or doubt them, or call them a liar. I'm having trouble telling the difference between Doubt and Lie. But from what I can tell, you can call them a liar if you have definitive evidence their statement is false. You can doubt them if you think their statement is false, but have no real evidence to back it up.</p><p>What's hilarious is as your detective level goes up, you can use a "life-line" to help you choose truth/doubt/lie. Using a point will take a way an answer. You can also "phone a friend" by using points to see what the Rockstar Social Club recommends. :)</p><p>I guess it reminds me more of Phoenix Wright, rather than Heavy Rain because Heavy Rain felt more fluid and natural. Phoenix Wright and L.A.Noire have a very apparent game-y layer for the investigation and interrogation that does not suspend my disbelief. But you still do the same type of things in all 3 games.<br/>____</p><p>It's hard to not say this is some kind of a GTA clone, since it is open world and made by Rockstar.</p><p>While GTA is totally open world, and you can pretty much do anything at any time, L.A.Noire feels more restrictive. Between Case 1 and Case 2, there was no leisure time, or even an option to choose Case 2. In that manor, it feels less open, and far more mission oriented. I feel like I'm wasting time, when I'm driving off to stop a random street crime, search for hidden cars, or find historical landmarks. Also, since you're playing a cop, you don't really have much the full spectrum of morality choice. It's kinda like Mass Effect in that way, where you're either play Captain Picard or Dirty Hairy. You're still on the good side of the law. And you can't change that.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 20, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 18, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Kagoshima</h3><p><b>One year ago</b>, Dave and I took a trip to Japan.  The first leg of our trip took us to southern Kyushu to Kagoshima to visit Brett, and visit someplace I've never been before.  Kagoshima is a port city protected by its surrounding mountains.  It's right next to Kagoshima Bay, and in the center of Kagoshima Bay is a very large dorment volcano, Sakura-jima.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7655.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7655.webp"  /></p><p>The morning before we left Kagoshima, Dave and I went up one of the surrounding mountains to an observation point which overlooked the town, and snapped a couple pictures.</p><p class='img'>I'm super proud of this one:  (click on it)<br/><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7665_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7665_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7665_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7665_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kagoshima/IMG_7665_stitch_t.webp"  /></a></p><p>Brett had a fun time showing us around the city.  He took us to a rotating sushi place for dinner one night located on the boardwalk near the shore of Kagoshima Bay.  Along the boardwalk were some natural volcanic springs just large enough to dip your feet into.</p><p>He also took us on a tour of the local shopping arcade, and showed us all the fun stores he buys his stuff at.  His book store, music store, toy store, and, of course, his local bar.</p><p>Unfortunately, our time in Kagoshima was too short to fully enjoy it, but it was a great start to our vacation.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 18, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 18, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Kumamoto Castle and Shimabara Castle</h3><p>One of my favorite tourist destinations in Japan is Japanese Castles.  We are pretty deprived in America when it comes to deep cultural architectural artifacts as our nation's history is a mere 200 years old. While the Japanese people have been on that island ever since it disconnected itself from main Asia. Also, Japanese Castles wildly interest me as they're usually nestled into modern society.</p><p>Anyway, on our trip, <b>exactly one year ago</b>, Dave and I had the fortune of visiting two of Kyushu's standing castles: Kumamoto and Shimbara.  After our visit to Kagoshima in southern Kyushu, we traveled north on our way to Nagasaki.  As a waypoint, we stopped at Kumamoto for a night.  In the morning, we head took a ferry across the Shimabara sea to Shimabara, and ultimately Nagasaki.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto Castle</b></div><p>Unfortunately, we left Kagoshima much later than expected, and arrived in Kumamoto around 4pm.  We got to our hotel, checked in, and made our way to Kumamoto Castle.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7709.webp"  /></p><p>We arrived at Kumamoto Castle a bit after 5pm, and had less than an hour to explore this marvel.  So, we ran around the castle, and made our way to the top as fast as we could.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7710_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7715.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7716_stitch.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7722_stitch.webp"  /></p><p>Here's a panoramic photo from the top: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7725_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7725_stitch.webp">Image!</a></p><p>It was a very pretty castle, and it's grounds were rather large, but we only had time to visit the castle itself.  We had barely gotten there, and had to leave already.  For the rest of the night we got some dinner, and went shopping for games and other things.  That story is detailed here: <a href="/old/v6/games-i-buy-ddr-edition" title="/games-i-buy-ddr-edition">Games I Buy: DDR Edition</a></p><div class='title'><b>Shimabara Castle</b></div><p>In the morning, we made way to Kumamoto Port, and sailed across the Shimabara Sea to Nagasaki Prefecture.  It was somewhat foggy out that day.  It felt like we were sailing into the unknown.  We left the port behind, and eventually it faded away into the gray void.</p><p>Dave and I basically relaxed on our voyage.  I don't really remember doing anything special.  Eventually, land started coming into view from a far.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100518_shimabara/IMG_7793.webp"  /></p><p>It was the port of Shimabara, totalled overshadowed by Mt. Fugen.  Mt. Fugen and the Unzen resort nearby was our first field trip when studying abroad.  We spent the day climbing to the top, which gave a great view of the volcano festering along side it.  Here's pictures from back then: <a href="/old/v6/i-climbed-another-mountain" title="/i-climbed-another-mountain">Images!</a></p><p>Anyway, our ferry sailed parallel to the harbor for a while and finally docked.  Dave and I exited the craft and walked to the nearest train station.  20 minutes later our train arrived, and we got off at the castle grounds.

One weekend when studying abroad, a fellow JASIN student, Brian, and I took a Saturday and rode the train out here.  The castle hadn't changed one bit in the last 4 years.  The entire compound was basically trapped in time.  It suffered no degredation due to the upkeep of its staff.  Likewise, it had not evolved or iterated in its years either.  It was a relic frozen in time.  Which makes sense...  It's a historic monument.  They aren't going to build any new wings of the fortress.</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto v. Shimabara</b></div><p>The difference between Kumamoto and Shimabara are quite clear.  First off, Kumamoto is the capitol of Kumamoto Prefecture.  It's an actual city, rather than a rural village.  It's the center of all of Kyushu, and has thousands of people through its area everyday.  It has more cash flowing through it, therefore it's castle is more expansive, complex, and vast.</p><p>Shimbara is a simple town with a simple castle.  It has a single structural point that continues to the sky, rather than multiple wings.  The compound has several buildings, but it's mostly towers and keeps, rather than offices and barracks.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 18, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 18, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Games I buy: DDR edition</h3><p>As a game collector, you eventually come across a game that you simply cannot find.  A game that's not necessary rare, but uncommon.  The only distinction between the two being demand.  This particular game for me is (was) Dance Dance Revolution Party Collection.</p><p>DDR Party Collection was released in Dec 2003 as a follow-up and compliment to DDR Extreme.  The arcade version of DDR Extreme had so many songs that the home release couldn't contain them all and they released two games.  DDR Extreme had all the new original songs, plus some favorites.  While DDR Party Collection contained the bulk of the favorites and classics they couldn't pack into DDR Extreme.  It used the exact same engine as DDR Extreme, and had just as many songs!</p><p>We played this game a few times at DDR Nights in college, as Tony had a ROM copy, but I wished someday to own a legitimate copy.   Throughout my Study Abroad in Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  Throughout my yearly vacations to Japan, I searched for this game, but could not find it.  I eventually gave up and decided to buy a copy off ebay, but they were no longer listed!  No one was selling.</p><p>It was <b>one year ago yesterday</b> that I finally found a copy.  My 6 year long quest had finally come to its end in Kumamoto.  And it was a fated encounter...</p><div class='title'><b>Kumamoto</b></div><p>After Dave and I visited Kagoshima, we traveled North to Kumamoto.  Kumamoto is Kyushu's central prefecture, and it's focal point is the gigantic castle in the dead center of town.  Dave and I were able to visit the castle, but only 30-40 minutes before it closed.  Afterward, we wondered what to do.</p><p>On my map, I had one location written down which was a Geo (video game store) not too far east of the Capitol.  We ventured down the castle hill, and made it to the train station.  We passed some delicious looking restaurants on the way there, but wanted to ensure we got on the train.  When we got to the train station, the train wasn't scheduled to arrive for another 20 or 30 minutes, so we backtracked to this interesting hole-in-the-wall restaurant.</p><div class='title'><b>Choboiyaki</b></div><p>This restaurant served Okonomiyaki, but it's not the type you would expect.  It was definitely prepared in a similar manner, but the pancake was HUGE.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7767.webp"  /></p><p>The radius of this pancake is about as large as the diameter should be.  She piled on the cabbage, and smashed it all down into form.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7768.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7769.webp"  /></p><p>The pancake was flipped over, folded, and cut up into servable pieces.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7773.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7774.webp"  /></p><p>And like all Okonomiyaki, it was absolutely delicious.  Between her semi-decent english and my horrible Japanese, we were able to talk a little bit about what she was actually making...</p><p>Japan may look somewhat small, especially compared to the United States, but it is incredibly diverse.  As a country, Japan grew from isolation, and that isolation spread to its culture, and it culture is known for taking elements of other culture, assimilating them, and expanding on them.  So you get plenty of local cultural traits you won't find anywhere else.  And this especially applies to food.</p><p>This particular version of Okonomiyaki is only local to Kumamoto and is known as Choboiyaki.  At least I think that's what she said.  Here's a pic of the menu with the name on it: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7770.webp">Image!</a>.  Maybe it's just Choboyaki...  or Chobomiyaki, except the 'ya' fire kanji immediately follows 'chobo'.  I dunno...</p><div class='title'><b>Off to Geo</b></div><p>That stuff was delicious and unique, but it's off to the game store to kill time.  I'm sure Dave was somewhat bored with my over-attentive scrutiny of searching every single game they owned, so I didn't go through absolutely everything.  I searched PS2 games and found nothing.  I skimmed PS1, skimmed Saturn, searched Dreamcast, and that was pretty much it.  I couldn't quit find the Rhythm game section for PS2, but didn't want to bore Dave that much more.</p><p>Though, on my way out, Beatmania caught my eye.  "Hold on a second.." I said as I crotched down to take a look, and HOLY CRAP!  What do you know!  It just so happened that they had a copy of DDR Party Collection on the shelf.  I was pretty surprised, as I had never seen this game in the wild.  Though, I didn't get my hopes completely up, as in the past, I happened across a game on the shelf, and they ultimated didn't actually have it in stock.</p><p>I took the case to the counter as my only purchase.  They went around the corner to search through their PS2 games, and didn't seem to immediately find it.  The two girls came back to the counter to take a look at the case again and noticed something they had missed on first glance.  They went to the back and came back with this:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7781.webp"  /></p><p>Exclamation point!  Not only did they have a copy of the game, they had the limited edition release of the game that came with a dance pad, complete with bucket.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7783.webp"  /></p><p>I looked closer at the sales label (<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7784.webp">pictured here</a>), and it had the sale date as Dec 11th, 2003.  Not only did they have this in their possesion, but it's been since RELEASE DAY!  It had waited for 6 1/2 years collecting dust and being constantly passed up but patrons until I came through the doors.  One of the games I've been searching for 6 years, and I found a release copy NEW.</p><p>This is fate.  I immediately bought it.</p><p>Unfortunately, having a bucket of DDR turned into a slight difficulty considering Dave and I packed VERY lightly for our trip.  I had no room for this thing in my luggage.  But how could I not keep this thing that I was destined to own!</p><p>Well, I don't need the crappy DDR pad.  So, I threw that in the trash.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7785.webp"  /></p><p>I stuff the bucket full of my dirty clothes</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7786.webp"  /></p><p>And doing so gave me plenty of room to store in my luggage</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100517_kumamoto/IMG_7788.webp"  /></p><p>Perfect!</p><p>And so my quest ends.  The game that took me the longest time to find was finally found.  (Actually, I guess that's not true, as I've been searching for a copy of Snatcher on Sega CD since the late 90s.)  With DDR Party in hand, my PS2 DDR Collection is complete.  I have all the games I want. ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on May 18, 2011<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">May 9, 2011</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Running in 2011</h3><p>Over the weekend, I ran my first Half Marathon of the 2011 Season.  And by Season, I mean an somewhat arbitrary range of dates to split up my winter races and non-winter races.  Training is much more difficult in the winter, so I don't want my winter times bringing down my non-winter times.</p><div class='title'><b>Seasons</b></div><p>What I am defining as the 2011 Running Season is basically Last April to Late October.  This is just for the Midwest and like-climates though.  Warmer climates would make it much easier to train and run all year round, so the "season" would probably just be the entire year.</p><p>For me, the season began last weekend with Madison's annual Crazy Legs Classic.  It's a 8 kilometer run from Capitol Square, through UW-Madison campus, and ending on Randal Field.  It's a really good start for the year, and the entire town really gets into it.  Almost 10,000 runners competed this year.</p><div class='title'><b>Getting back into Running</b></div><p>I did much better than last year, but I felt incredibly sluggish.  Winter makes it nearly impossible for me to train.  I can't train outside because it's too cold, and I can't train inside because it's too boring.  Before hitting the pavement back in March, I hadn't done any running at all since the Seattle Half Marathon and the Sandbox Indoor Half Marathon.  </p><p>Getting back into the work out is hard.  It was still cold out, so I wasn't getting any positive vibes from the sun.  And I felt horrible after each run.  I didn't feel like I was getting any benefit from it at all.  But there's one thing I've learned from running over the past 2 years.  <b>Motivation builds off of itself.</b>  </p><p>I know that running is beneficial for me, so I had to force myself to get out there and do it.  For April, I was outside every other day, and still felt like I wasn't getting any from it, but I kept doing it.</p><p>My Crazy Legs time wasn't the greatest (50 minutes), but I did better than last year.  Later in the week on Wednesday, the sun was out and shining, and I had an amazing run that day.  I was actually starting to feel some of the benefits of running, even though I still felt like crap.</p><div class='title'><b>Door County Half Marathon</b></div><p>This past weekend, I ran in the Door County Half Marathon, and going into it, I wasn't feeling very optimistic.  I still felt sluggish, and figured I would get a 2:30, or something.  But that wasn't the case.  I pushed forward, and actually started feeling really good.  In the middle of the race, my legs started matching pace with what I was capable of last year.  I was flying down hills, and able to build off of specific songs I was listening to.  I glided across the finish line and achieved a 2:20:02.</p><p>2:20 isn't my best time, but it is much faster than where I was at last year at this time.  My 2010 time for Door County was 2:34, and it was the first race where I really pushed myself.  I figured I would be around the same time this year, but I feel great that I was able to retain much of the speed I was working towards last year.</p><div class='title'><b>Future</b></div><p>Getting a decent time (for me) has given me new motivation to continue to run, and do much better than last year.  I have 3 goals this year, but they all lead to the same thing.  1) I want to surpass my high score of 2:13.  2) I want to surpass 2:03, which is the world record for the FULL marathon.  and 3) I want to surpass 2 hours.  So, even though, they are 3 separate goals, they are really the same goal.  I guess "milestones" would be a better way to describe it.</p><p>Currently, I'm signed up for 2 more half marathons this year, but I'm sure I'll sign up for more as time goes on.</p><p>May 29th // Madison Half Marathon<br/>Aug 20th // Madison Mini-Marathon</p><p>Additionally, I signed up for my first FULL marathon, which is Milwaukee's Lakefront Marathon.  I was actually planning on signing up last year, but it was completely full by the time I decided to do so.  That takes place on October 2nd, so there is plenty of time to train and build up to it.</p><p>Run run run!</p><p>Also, if you're wondering, I keep track of all my racing times through Google Docs.
