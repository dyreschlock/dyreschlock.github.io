Some of these came out of PAX East, and the others followed a month or two afterward.  The updates include the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2314.webp" /></p><p>2012 Holiday Pack<br/>2013 Holiday Pack<br/>90s Nostalgia Pack<br/>Pwnmeal 2014 PAX East Cards<br/>Crabs Adjust Humidity vol. 3</p><p>The 90s packs were available at PAX East, but are now available for everyone on the Cards Against Humanity website, along with the 2012 and 2013 Holiday Packs.  The Crabs vol. 3 set can be purchased from the Vampire Squid website along with the previous volumes.  The Pwnmeal cards on the other hand…</p><div class='title'><b>PWNMeal</b></div><p>With the recent explosion of food products advertised to gamers as "Extreme Gamer Fuel," Max Tempkin, the co-creator of Cards Against Humanity, and current boss, had a twitter conversation about its ridiculousness with his friends.  This turned into a back-and-forth about dumb names for foods they haven't come up with yet.  When the topic of extreme oatmeal was introduced, Max had an idea that he could not stop himself from completing.</p><p>On April 12th, at PAX East in Boston, Max unveiled PWNMeal at the Giant Bomb Panel.</p><p><br/>Cards Against Humanity created 150,000 package of PWNMeal, and gave them out to as many people as they could at PAX East.  Each PAX East swag bag included one pouch of PWNMeal.  </p><p>There are 4 different flavors of PWNMeal: Strawberries and Carnage, No Scope Headshot Blueberry, MOBAnana Bread, and Cinnamon K/D Ratioatmeal.  And they were complete with a prize inside!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2325.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2328.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2330.webp" /></p><p>Each PWNMeal package contains 10 cards for Cards Against Humanity: 8 white cards, and 2 black cards, of which there are a total of 27 different cards.</p><p>I bought a few packages from eBay after PAX East had finished.  I think I paid about $10 for each package.</p><p>Here's the distribution of cards I received from the 5 packs:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2341.webp" /></p><p>I'm still missing 4 cards: #12, #17, #22, and #25.  Unlike the PAX Prime 2013 cards, these seem pretty evenly distributed.  Seems like the first 10 are common.  The second 10 are slightly less common, but not too bad.  I think I just got unlucky with the black cards.</p><p>There are still some unfunny PAX memes and inside jokes, but for the most part, these cards aren't too bad.  There are some good additions. :)</p><div class='title'><b>Expansions</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2351.webp" /></p><p>With these new additions, I own the following official expansions:</p><p>An original set of Cards Against Humanity (I'm not sure which version)<br/>The First, Second, Third, and Fourth (Official) Expansions<br/>The Holiday 2012, Holiday 2013, Box, and 90s Nostalgia Packs<br/>The PAX East 2013, PAX Prime 2013, and PAX East 2014 PWNMeal Packs</p><p>And the following unofficial expansions:</p><p>The UK Expansion (Bootleg - read about it here: <a href="/old/v6/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions" title="/cards-against-humanity-uk-expansions">February 10th, 2014</a>)<br/>and.. Crabs Adjust Humidity volumes One, Two, and Three.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140727_cah/IMG_2355.webp" /></p><p>Now, my Bigger Blacker Box is 100% full.  That expansion box holds all of my blank cards.  I think I'm going to need to buy a second box to store some cards.</p><div class='title'><b>Missing</b></div><p>There are still 4 official release from Cards Against Humanity that I'm missing:  The Canada Conversion Set, the Reject Pack, the House of Cards pack, and the PAX East 2014 Panel Packs.</p><p><b>Canada Conversion Set</b> is a small set of cards included with the Canadian version of the game.  Rather than create a completely separate Canadian version of the game, the creators simply released the same version of the game for Canada, but added a small pack of localized cards that were Canada specific.  I don't think these cards are marked in anyway.  Plus they're Canada specific, so they aren't that funny to me.  It's not really worth it for me to buy it.</p><p><b>The Reject Pack</b> is a small package of several cards rejected from the original release of the game.  Each card was selected by one of the creators of the game, and features a drawing of their portrait at the bottom of the card.  These packs were given away at fan events.  Sometimes they were given to people with corrected orders.  They show up on eBay every now and then, but sell for $100.</p><p><i>Update</i>: Actually, some retailers are selling these on amazon for $10.  I bought two packs from one of the sellers. It's possible that they're bootleg, though.</p><p><b>House of Cards Pack</b> was something I totally and completely missed.  Netflix and Cards joined together and released a pack of cards based of the House of Cards television program available on Netflix.  This happened in January (or February) this year.  There are some on eBay, but sell for $60.</p><p><b>PAX East 2014 Panel Packs</b>:  In addition to the PWNMeal cards at PAX East, the creators of Cards Against Humanity performed another crazy feat of marketing.  They held a panel on Saturday, and during the panel the audience suggested cards to the panelists.  The top 10 cards were compiled, and sent to a print-shop.  They were completed overnight, and handed out to the attendees the following day.  Around 200 of these cards were made, and only given to those who attended the panel.</p><div class='title'><b>Quality over Quantity</b></div><p>As they say, with so many cards, it can difficult to have some quality sessions of Cards Against Humanity.  Some of those Crabs cards just aren't funny, and don't really work in most situations.  The next time I get a chance to play with friends, I'm going to start separating the shitty useless cards into a separate pile.  Hence the need for a second black box. :)</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 28, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 27, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Leaving Okinawa</h3><p>After my week long stay in Okinawa, it was time to return back to the mainland and the mountains.

Chibi Chiri Gama is in Yomitan directly north of where the American landed their forces. As the Americans took over the nearby airfield and moved into Yomitan, the residents of Yomitan all ran into the cave for shelter. The US army sent a translated message into the cave to come out and you'll not be harmed, but they did not believe them. The Japanese army had indoctrinated all citizens of their violent and torturous outcome if they were captured.</p><p>On April 2nd, as the US army was returning to try and get them out, the Japanese army stuffed the entrance of the cave with gasoline soaked futons, and lit them on fire, killing all 80+ civilians in the cave to avoid their capture.</p><p>Now, at the cave, are statues memorializing the suffering of their townspeople and the consequence of the radicalization of war.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 25, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 25, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Former Yomitan Airfield and Bunker</h3><p>Following inland from the beach where the US army landed on April 1st 1945 is the former Yomitan Airfield where the Japanese army deployed its plane to fight the Americans over the seas.

The Americans made landfall in Okinawa on April 1st 1945. This was north of the main city and concentration of Japanese forces. The Americans took over the airfields nearby cutting the Japanese army in half.

The Himeyuri Junior High School was an all girl's school with 222 students and 18 teachers. During the battle, the Japanese army conscripted all of its 240 students and staff members to aid them in the fight against the US. The girls weren't very useful to the army as combatants, so they used them as a medical unit. They created a triage / mobile hospital in the caves underneath the school to help soldiers wounded in battle. </p><p>The girls were constantly told that they'd be safe and returned to their families after they defeated America, but both were lies. Throughout the battle, 19 of the girls were killed. As defeat seemed imminent, on June 18th 1945, 4 days before the Japanese army was completed defeated, the Japanese army dissolved the Himeyuri unit and told the students and teachers to go home. </p><p>They had no where to go. They had spent most of their time underground, and the entire landscape had turned into a burning ravaged warscape with constant gunfire and death. Some of the school stayed in groups and tried finding shelter. Within the next day, 5 teachers and 46 students were killed hiding in a building destroyed by the US forces. The army accepted some girls into another medical unit, but all others were told to go away and leave. All girls accepted back were killed.</p><p>Teachers would try to stay in charge of a group of girls, but would often leave the girls to try and find the best way to safety. They would not return. Through overwhelming fear of being captured by the Americans, girls would kill themselves by jumping off the cliffs, or using cyanide given to them by other soldiers.</p><p>In the end, only 2 teachers and 11 students survived the war.</p><p>The Himeyuri Peace Museum is built on the site of the junior high school and tells the story of these girls and the effects of war.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 23, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 23, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Okinawa Peace Memorial Museum</h3><p>The Okinawa Peace Memorial Museum chronicles Japan's entrance into World War II and the cost of following exceptionalism. The museum is located south on Naha island and you must take a bus (or drive) to visit it. This is one of Japan's three major Peace memorial museums. Although the peace museums in Hiroshima and Nagasaki often overshadow it.</p><p>Inside, relics of the war are displayed as well as the timeline of decisions that led to Japan's involvement in the war and the suffering its citizens endured because of it.

There are obviously very distinct buildings and landscapes in mainland Japan, but they all follow the same rules and have the same ideas at heart. Okinawan buildings are built to withstand typhoons and harsh summer heat. But even so, the concrete buildings have all been aged by the weather beating down on them.</p><p>Much of the architecture and stores come from the overall demographic of Okinawa, which is split into 3 mostly balanced cultures, compared to the overall Japanese culture of the mainland. These three cultures are Ryukyuan, Japanese, and American. The Ryukyuan culture comes from the original inhabitants of the islands until the Japanese emperor took over. The Japanese culture comes from the empire, obviously. And the American culture comes from the US Base in Kadena, and its influence.</p><p>Besides that, the other distinct thing about Okinawa is elevation. It is the flattest place in all of Japan. It's weird looking across the horizon and not seeing any mountains or high hills of any kind.</p><div class='title'><b>Kofun</b></div><p>While walking around Naha, I took a few photos of Kofun darted in various neighborhoods.</p><p>Kofun are ancient Japanese tombs or burial mounds. Kofun were constructed in Japan from the 3rd to 7th century and used to bury highly influential people of the area. Throughout Japan, over 150,000 kofun have been discovered, and archeologists have catalogued their contents, as well as the sarcophagi and those within.</p><p>In the main islands of Japan, Kofun actually look like burial mounds. A main circular room was constructed within the ground, with walls built up from rocks and a primitive version of plaster. Above ground, dirt was piled and compacted on the room the create stability. Attached to the circular room is a rectangular or trapezoidal area, given the mound its overall keyhole shape.</p><p>In Okinawa, Kofun are much smaller and are nicknamed "Turtle Back Tombs" because of their shape.</p><div class='title'><b>Photos</b></div><p>Below are the photos I took from walking around town and finding new and interesting things.</p><p><i>Note: This post was made in Feb 2025 and back-dated to the time of the events</i></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 22, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">July 22, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Former Japanese Navy Underground Headquarters</h3><p>In the center of Naha, to prevent its buildings from being easy targets by planes and artillery fire, the Japanese navy dug and built a series of tunnels and rooms underground and used this as its headquarters for the Japanese navy.</p><p>After the American Army made landfall in Okinawa on April 1st 1945, and continued to push back the Japanese forces, it was clear that the headquarters would be overrun.

It's probably the most "magnificent" mountain viewable from Takayama City.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/130731_takayama/IMG_2112.webp" /></p><p>The Goshikigahara plateau lies within those highborn forests on the west end of the mountain.  Technically, the area should be visible in the above photo.  The forests in this area have never been cut, or disturbed by human hands.  </p><p>In fact, the locals swear that the forests are inhabited by a specie of fairy.  They chat and play in the forest.  Female fairies twinkle like a rainbow.  Male fairies have a silver twinkle.  These fairy are only visible to humans who are pure of heart.  Any person that has caused harm to the environment by littering, or picking or breaking plants will never see them.  Which pretty much rules out everyone on earth.</p><p>If you want to tour Goshikigahara, you must make a reservation, and be accompanied with a guide to show you around.  Tours are about 8500<span class='ja'>円</span> ($85) at the lowest, and generally take about 7 hours.  You need to sign a consent form, too.</p><p>On this particular day, I was quite fortunate to be part of a tour put together by the city of Takayama.  It was only 6000<span class='ja'>円</span>, too. :) This tour was in honor of a very special guest that came to Takayama, Dr. Miya____?  On Saturday, volunteer city officials joined the doctor at the Hida Wisdom Earth Center, and planted a field of trees.

We started walking the course around 9:30am.  There was a light rain in the air.  It was nothing heavy or torrential.  It made the wooden walking bridge incredibly slick, though.  Our group continued across it at a very slow pace to make sure no one slipped and hurt themselves.</p><p>We stopped every couple of minutes, and Dr. Miya___? gave a speech explaining the surrounding fauna.  When we reached the actual wasabi plants, he bent down, and pulled up a wasabi plant for all of us to examine.  Each of us, pricked a tiny portion of the plant and ate it.  I could definitely taste a hint of wasabi, but it wasn't nearly as potent as the stuff you'd have at restaurants, or grocery stores.  He gave us another wasabi plant to taste.  This time, I tried part of the stem, and that definitely held the potent spicy flavor I was used to.</p><p>We continued through the light rain, and Miya___? continued to give light explanations of the environment around us.</p><p>After about 40 minutes, we reached the road once again and met with the Snake Dashidani Bridge <span class='ja'>蛇出谷橋</span> (<span class='ja'>じゃだしだに</span>).

Nunobiki Falls <span class='ja'>布引滝</span></b></div><p>Next we met the actual treasure of this hiking trail, the Nunobiki Falls, which were directly next to the Yokote and Sakura-kon waterfalls.  Unlike the other 2 falls, the water forming Nunobiki was completely natural, squeezed from the rocks and reservoirs below the surface.  No amount of rain water would ever change the way these falls look.</p><p>This is rather evident when looking at the shape of the falls.  Rather than a concentrated source of water flowing over a cliff, several scattered pockets of water are shot through the cliff face, and flowing down the side.  If this waterfall was formed by a creek, stream or river, a singular focal point would've been carved out of the round over the course of thousands of years.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9892_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>After passing by the falls, I noticed something that was clearly manmade, and not in use for quite a while.  Apparently the early settlers of these lands mined for copper, zinc and iron.  The above structure was carved out of the rock to channel the water from the falls, and generate electricity for the mines.  In this area, watermills were set up to collect the energy and pass it on to the mines.</p><p>I guess, over the years, those watermills were removed to preserve the nature the falls.</p><div class='title'><b>10. Deai Hut <span class='ja'>出合い小屋</span></b></div><p>A few hundred meters away was our final destination of the hike.  We got there around 2:30pm.  Our busses were already waited for us at the Deai Hut.  We went inside, and got a chance to change our clothes again, so we weren't walking around soaking wet.</p><p>We got there well before the women's group, so nearby our guide showed us some funky moss.  Underneath some nearby rocks were moss than reflected any light passing into it.  I'm not sure if my photo really highlights this interesting phenomena, but it was a neat trick.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9909.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140629_goshikigahara/IMG_9911.webp" /></p><p>Despite being a cold and rainy day, I think the hike was totally worth it.  For the last year and a half, I've lived in the foothills off these mountains, and never saw any of this stuff up close.</p><p>One of the greatest things about living in Takayama is the vast amount of nature that surrounds me everyday.  Well over half the city's area is covered in this wilderness forged from the depths of earth at the basins of several volcanoes.  It's absolutely stunning and beautiful. :)</p><p>Hopefully before I leave Takayama, I'll have a chance to hike the second trail available, which features many more waterfalls.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on July 1, 2014<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">July 2014</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/goshikigahara">1</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/kitayama">11</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/chubu-airport">21</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/around-okinawa">22</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/himeyuri-peace-museum">23</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/sugar-loaf-hill">24</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/kadena-air-base">25</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/hiji-waterfall">26</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/leaving-okinawa">27</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/cards-against-humanity-pax-east-additions">28</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
