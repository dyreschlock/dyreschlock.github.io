I was trying to think of a way I could scam Gamestop out of a DLC code for their <em>exclusive</em> weapons and armor.  I don't actually care about having the items in the game, but I kinda want that DLC card to complete my edition.</p><p>I had already preordered Mass Effect 2 Collector's Edition months ago on Amazon.  Plus, I bought a preorder at Best Buy, so I could get their <em>exclusive</em> armor.</p><div class='title'><b>Wait!</b></div><p>But then I thought, "Didn't I order Mass Effect 2 with release day shipping from Amazon?  Shouldn't that have shipped already?  Shouldn't I have gotten an email about it?"  Way back when the Collector's Edition first appeared on amazon I didn't instantly buy it.  I was waiting for the ECA to release more Amazon discount codes, or waiting for a discounted Amazon price, rather than the full $70.  I thought, "Did I actually forget to go back and actually buy it?  Did I never actually order it?"</p><p>I was on my way to Gamestop, anyways.  I wanted that DLC card.  And, as a consolation, I was going to Preorder Yakuza 3 since Gamestop has <em>exclusive</em> DLC for that, too.  Ugh.</p><p>When I parked my car, I brought up Amazon on my iPhone and checked my open orders and there was <b><em>nothing!</em></b> I saw no order for Mass Effect, or any history of ever buying it.  Whoops.</p><div class='title'><b>Scavenger Mode</b></div><p>The game comes out tomorrow and I don't actually have a Collector's Edition spoken for.  So, I tried "preordering" at Gamestop since I was there.  Typically, Gamestop will only let you preorder games up until the week before its release.  They won't let you preorder a game that comes out the next day because they already have all their copies in stock.  You'd essentially be buying someone else's copy.  Which would be the same if anywhere let me preorder it at this point.</p><p>But I thought, "eh, fuck it.  Perhaps the employees aren't keen on this fact."  Unfortunately they were keen.  And, in addition, Gamestop discontinued the preorder of Mass Effect 2 Collector's Edition a mere 3 weeks after its availability in the system.  I just stuck with my preorder of <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=76648" title="http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductDetails.aspx?product_id=76648">Yakuza 3</a>.</p><p>Best Buy was taking preorders, so that was my next stop.  Even though, I had already preordered the game through Best Buy, I was pretty sure it was the regular edition I laid out $5 for.  I checked the place to see if they were stupid enough to leave out all their preorder boxes, and they were not.  All the boxes had been removed from the shelf.</p><p>In fact, now that I'm at home, I actually preordered the PC version by mistake.  At the time I bought it, they must've already removed all their boxes for the Xbox 360 version.  Which would go along with Gamestop's story of only preordering the game for 3 weeks.</p><p>I stopped off at Toys R Us to see if they were offering preorders.  They would definitely be ignorant to the point of forgetting something like that.  But they were not offering.</p><div class='title'><b>Internet</b></div><p>Unfortunately, those were really my only choices to turn to in the real world.  I don't think any other retailer in Madison would carry the Collector's Edition; let alone, not be knowledgeable enough for me to prey on.  So, the Internet is my final recluse.</p><p>Amazon no longer accepts orders.  Though, some sellers have theirs available for $110.  Best Buy dot Com has no availability.  GameStop dot Com doesn't accept my credit card anymore.  Plus, they're out too.  Doing a Shopping Search on Google gives retailers who are either sold out, or very shady.</p><p>There's a bunch of dudes on eBay selling their copies, and one particular dude selling his for $90 w/ free shipping.  An extra $20 isn't TOOO bad.  Plus, I sold the Collector's Edition DLC from Dragon Age for $40.  I could probably do the same and walk away with a $50 game.  Eh, fuck it.  I've wasted more money on less before.  Besides, my Paypal Account has enough money to cover the whole thing.</p><p>Cha-ching.</p><div class='title'><b>Further Investigation</b></div><p>After being in my head for this whole venture, which lasted about an hour, I went back to Amazon dot Com (this time on my computer).  I went around in my order explorer and actually <b>found</b> my order for Mass Effect 2.  Apparently it didn't show up in my future or past orders because it's in the "now shipping" order queue.  It can't be changed or modified because they're currently putting it together to ship.</p><p>The estimated arrival date is January 26th, though.  I don't know how they plan on getting that package to my apartment tomorrow, if they're still busy putting it in a box, right now.</p><p>As a result of all this nonsense, I find myself with an extra copy of the Collector's Edition.  I'll probably just turn around and put it back on eBay.  Someone will probably buy it for $100.</p><p>Still no DLC card from Gamestop. :/</p><p>I think I need something better to do with my evenings...<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 25, 2010<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">January 25, 2010</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Music in Madison</h3><p>Over the past week, I've been to a couple music events in Madison that were pretty fun.  I love living in a town where all the great venues, bars, and other attractions are all in one small area.  A town large enough to foster, nurture, and bring in some amazing talent.  Yet, small enough that I can get anywhere in 30 minutes at most. ^_^  Especially when it's January and the weather is horrible.</p><p><b>Dustin Zahn @ High Noon</b> // Jan 15th</p><p>Last weekend, we caught word of some amazing music at the High Noon and stopped there for the evening.  The air was filled with an amazing energy of raw techno, house and a little electro.  Dustin Zahn kept the crowd moving all night long.  It was one of the best nights I've had in Madison.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v9HdtyPlDEM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arEZg4aH40k" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Rez!</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MHDEVO1HcYE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Dustin Zahn hails from Minneapolis, which explains a lot.  The whole night gave off the vibe of a mid-90s rave.  The kind that were prevalent in niche corners of the USA, and especially in Minneapolis.  The Minneapolis rave scene gave birth to the amazing talent and fans that surge in Minneapolis today.  Last weekend was a glimpse into that pure energy.</p><p><b>Holy F*ck @ Majestic</b> // Jan 22nd</p><p>This weekend, Madison played host to Toronto's "must-see live act" Holy Fuck.  Apparently, these guys have "redefined" what it means to give a live performance by using their raw common-sense genius to build up new songs and sounds that make every one of their shows unique.</p><p>Unfortunately...  they conducted a DJ set.</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fzMuLePLx58" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/84PVEYey4H8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>They played some pretty awesome songs.  And after hearing what I recorded, some of the other songs sound pretty good too.  But, they came at the tail end of a horrible performance by a DJ duo known as the Fun Cartel.</p><p>The Fun Cartel are two guys with opposing musical tastes and skill.  The skinny afro guy was pretty cool.  But his sidekick would throw in tracks that completely ruined the vibe.  In addition, they failed almost each one of their transitions.  In the end, their set felt like a 3 year old's finger painting.  "Let's just throw in all of our favorite songs.  Orange mixes with Blue, right?!"  Ugh..</p><p>Also, our dinner plans for the evening didn't go so hot either.</p><p><b>Erebus @ The Annex</b> // Jan 23rd</p><p>Erebus is not in my realm of music.  They are Metal.  And while their music is definitely different than mine, metal fans could not love their music more.  Metal fans are born to rock, congregate, and mosh together.  Erebus does an amazing job of channeling that passion, energy and fandom into something that anyone with a strong passion for music can love.</p><p>Examples:</p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJTsfkXqEDw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><iframe class="ratio16by9" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jMknhpY2hHE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Even though there were probably 30 people or less in attendance, Erebus performed with such enthusiasm and attention that everything they did on stage was clearly meant for us.  We were the reason they were on stage.  The songs they chose, the monologues spoken.. it was all for us.  And the true fans reciprocated by doing what Metal fans do:  Hopping off the stage, slamming into each other, head bangin', and truly rockin' out.</p><p>I've seen them a couple times before, but this was truly their best night, in my opinion.  Though, I might be semi-biased.  Erebus' lead members are Dave and Gage.  Gage is one of my good friends in Madison.  We met at Widen back when we were both interns.  I first saw them perform live almost exactly 3 years ago, when they first performed live themselves (<a href="/old/v6/erebus-first-show" title="/erebus-first-show">here</a>).</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways</b></div><p>Anyways, Madison is pretty amazing.  Great music at a small scale. Daedelus is coming to town in 3 weeks! King Cannibal in 2.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 25, 2010<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">January 19, 2010</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Spring is the new Fall</h3><p>As I peer over at my library of video games, there are very few that I have purchased that were released in 2009.  I bought a couple games such as Retro Game Challenge, KORG DS-10, Pokemon Platinum, Street Fighter IV, Katamari Forever, Dragon Age, Raiden IV, and Metroid Prime Trilogy but that's really it.  There were only 8 games from last year that I felt were worth owning.</p><p><em>Edit:  I also bought Flower and Wipeout HD Fury which were PSN titles.  And that 3D Picross game for the Japanese DS.  So that brings the total to 11.</em></p><p>Don't get me wrong, 2009 had some great games, but many of which I finished in the span of a weekend and felt finished with them afterward.  I rented them through GameFly and just sent them back after completion.  Katamari and Dragon Age were exceptions to that...  Of course, there are still many I haven't gotten around to playing, yet.</p><p>2010 is looking very bright to me. There are many games coming in the next 5 months I can't wait to play.  There are as follows...</p><p>January 26th - <b>Mass Effect 2</b> - Xbox 360<br/>February 16th - <b>Ace Attorney Investigations: Edgeworth</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>February 16th - <b>KORG DS-10 Plus</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>February 23rd - <b>Heavy Rain</b> - Playstation 3<br/>March 9th - <b>Final Fantasy XIII</b> - Playstation 3<br/>March 14th - <b>Pokemon Heart Gold / Soul Silver</b> - Nintendo DS<br/>March 16th - <b>Dragon Age Awakening (expansion)</b> - Xbox 360<br/>March 22nd - <b>Yakuza 3</b> - Playstation 3<br/>May 11th - <b>3D Dot Game Heroes</b> - Playstation 3</p><p>There's 9 games on the list already, and that doesn't include Dead Rising 2, Epic Mickey, Sin and Punishment 2, Metroid Other M, <a href="http://augmentpro.com/halloween-ghostwire-augmented-reality-game-for-2010/" title="http://augmentpro.com/halloween-ghostwire-augmented-reality-game-for-2010/">Ghostwire</a> (that Augmented Reality ghost game on the DSi), Death Smiles and any other shmup that may be released in North America.</p><p>Also, I'll probably pick up a Nintendo DSi XL when those are released.  My Nintendo DS has been beaten incredibly hard and the touchscreen cannot be calibrated for accuracy anymore.  It has served me well these past 4 years, but games like Ouedan and Trauma Center are unplayable.</p><p>And with KORG DS-10 Plus and Ghostwire actually making use of the DSi features, it should be worth it.  Plus, there's all those downloadable puzzle games. ^_^  And there's that pile of unplayed DS games sitting on my shelf, as well.</p><p>Video Games!<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 19, 2010<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">January 19, 2010</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Mass Effect 2 DLC (+ Dr. Pepper)</h3><div class='title'><b>Dragon Age DLC</b></div><p>Bioware's recent game, Dragon Age, had an immense amount of Downloadable Content at launch.  I'm not specifically talking about the two extra quest lines: The Stone Prisoner and The Warden's Keep, which were both cut areas from the initial release of the game, and were offered free for those who actually purchased the game..  I'm talking about all the stupid items.</p><p>Nearly every first pressing of Dragon Age included the Blood Armor.  Preorders from Gamestop included a Memory Band, Guildmaster's Belt, Feral Wolf Charm, and a couple others.  Preorders from other places included a Dalish Ring, Lion's Paw, Band of Fire, and other crap.  If you bought the Collector's edition, you were treated with a spell book, a helmet, and a staff.</p><p>Beyond that, if you created a Character through the PC Character Creator, you'd receive some charm necklace.  There's also a Flash game available on DragonAge.com, that will net you 3 items throughout your playthrough.</p><p>It's all detailed in this GameFAQ: http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/xbox360/file/950918/58270</p><div class='title'><b>Mass Effect 2 DLC</b></div><p>It's pretty ridiculous.  And there's doing the exact same thing with Mass Effect 2.  Preorders from Gamestop include some set of Armor.  Preorders from other places will receive a different set of Armor.  If you bought Dragon Age and received that Blood Armor, that's unlocked in Mass Effect 2 also.</p><p>Also, if you play through the Mass Effect iPhone game, you unlock something in the game too.  I think one of the blogs around that time said you unlock an extra side quest where you meet the characters in the iPhone game.  That would definitely be better than an item.</p><p>There's also this way:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100118_masseffect2/IMG_6345.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100118_masseffect2/IMG_6345.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/100118_masseffect2/IMG_6345.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Dr. Pepper</b></div><p>Every specially marked bottles of Dr. Pepper will give you an unlock code.  Enter this code at DrPepper.com, and you can choose from a pile of DLC from an assortment of EA games.  Each unlock will be transferred to your EA account, and can be accessed from those games.</p><p>When I was refueling my automobile this evening, I entered the convenience store and bought the bottles shown above.  Unfortunately, Mass Effect 2 unlocks were not available on DrPepper.com at the moment.  Maybe that's because Mass Effect 2 isn't out yet?  Or maybe, a whole lot of gaming nerds bought a bunch of Dr. Pepper and redeemed all the available codes.  Probably the former.  I think some blog mentioned there are 5 unlocks for Mass Effect 2 through this promotion.  Each one a piece of Armor or a Weapon.</p><div class='title'><b>Other Random Tidbits</b></div><p>There are 2 other note-worthy pieces of news about the upcoming release of Mass Effect 2 that delight me.  The first one is that Bioware has said they plan on supporting Mass Effect 2 through expansions and DLC over the next two years.  They plan on doing this with Dragon Age as well, which has a expansion due in March which will add another 20-30 hours to the game.</p><p>The other tidbit is that Bioware has stated that they do not plan for the release time between Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3 to be as long as it has for the first release and next week.  They specifically stated that Mass Effect 3 will be released on current generation hardware.  It will not be on the Xbox 720, or whatever.</p><p>It seems that those "2 years" of expansions and DLC will lead up to the release of the final chapter in the Mass Effect Trilogy, which would be released sometime in 2012. Nice!</p><div class='title'><b>Excitement</b></div><p>Anyways, Mass Effect 2 is released next week! Hopefully, it'll be the "Empire Strikes Back" of the Trilogy, and not "Attack of the Clowns"</p><p>I'm quite excited.  Mass Effect is my favorite new game franchise spawned in this generation.  Its soundtrack is very moody and Sci Fi.  It's entire universe is very well thoughout, solid, and lends itself well to telling an interesting story without focusing on all the Science Fiction. It looks amazing. The art direction is diverse, sleek and sexy.</p><p>I think the one thing Mass Effect lacked were iconic characters.  I really hope the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team talked to each other over the course of development.  I think Dragon Age has set the bar for character interactions and distinct personalities.  It would be a shame if Mass Effect did not have those moments were you truly feel for the other characters.</p><p>Maybe it's hard to build sympathy or empathy for an alien or alien culture? Though, I think District 9 and Avatar did an alright job... just make Humans the bad guys!</p><p>Anywho, I can't wait to see how Mass Effect 2 unfolds. ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 19, 2010<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">January 17, 2010</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Not again</h3><p>I once had a dream where I was a child. As a child, my one possession was a Red Balloon. It was an awesome balloon. It was the world to me.</p><p>One day, I trotted along the road with my lovely Red Balloon, and I came upon a sad clown. He was alone, crying and without possessions. He saw my balloon, and he wanted it.</p><p>I saw that he was sad and was a clown, so I offered him my balloon.  He face ignited with glee.

He took grasp of the string which kept the Balloon near the Earth, and was delighted.</p><p>With the Red Balloon in hand, he loosened his grasp and let the Balloon escape our company.  In the air it rose and fluttered.</p><p>The clown's gaze turned from the Balloon back to me.  And he punched me in the face and stole my wallet.

Everyone knows about its existence and how it was the most anticipated game of 2009 and the highest grossing game as well.  And most people know of the controversial Airport scene.</p><p>I knew these things, but didn't really care.  I wasn't a fan of the original, and never really saw the appeal either.  I can't really find the words to describe why I disliked it.  I played it for about 20 minutes before I set the controller down and said, "this game is not for me."  I seemed unpolished, generic, and dull.  But whatever, lots of people seem to like it.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple weekends ago at Dave's place that I actually had a chance to play Modern Warfare 2, so I figured why not.  The videos that were shown at E3 made the game look beautiful.  And after the first couple of minutes, Modern Warfare 2 definitely prides itself on presentation.  It is one of the most beautiful looking games out there.</p><p>The beginning eased me into how to shoot things, and how to fight effectively in combat using more than just my main weapon.  Switching to a handgun is faster than reloading.  Using your knife is an instant kill when you're next to an enemy.  Also, your weapon will always snap to a nearby target when aiming.  It's easy to play, and lends itself well to different strategies when fighting many enemies.  There's always another way to accomplish your task.</p><p>Essentially, Modern Warfare 2 charmed me with its graphics, and the fluid varied controls kept me playing and challenged.  Last week, I received it from Gamefly and began my assault.</p><p><b>Airport Scene</b> (spoilers)</p><p>For those that don't know about the "airport scene"...  In the 4th chapter entitled "No Russian", you play as Private Allen.  He's the recruit you played in the beginning while getting used to the controls, and then put into a battle field fighting a militia.  At the end of the mission, General Shepard says he has a special mission for you.  You are to stick close to Makarov as a deep cover agent.  And this has brought you to a Russian airport.</p><p>The mission begins in a closet with Makarov and some other guys.  You are dressed in suits, bullet proof vests, and armed with chain guns.  Before Makarov opens the door he says, "Remember..  No Russian."  You walk out of the closet in a crowded airport security checkpoint.  Your group aims their weapons, and fire on the crowd.  You continue through the airport terminal mascaraing any individuals you find.  Some security guards fight back, but you can't get hurt.  Your group murders everyone.</p><p>Throughout this opening scene, you can choose to kill the innocent or do nothing.  If you shoot any of your group, the game quits and pulls you back to your last checkpoint.  If you stand back the doorway and not move anywhere, your group will wait.  The game forces you through this entire scene, and you can't prevent anything from happening, unless you want to quit the game completely.</p><p>After going through the terminal, walking over all the innocent slain, the Russian forces arrive and you fight them and make your way to the get-a-way car.  Everyone hops in in front of you.  Someone comments, "This will definitely send a message."  As the last person in, Makarov stops you, and pierces your chest with a bullet.  Makarov replies, "No, this is the message."  And your dead American body responsible for this terrorist attack on Russia creates war between America and Russia.</p><p><b>The Ending</b> (spoilers)</p><p>Throughout Modern Warfare 2 you go back and forth between "Ramirez" fighting Russian troops on American soil, and "Roach" part of Task Force 141 who know that Makarov is behind the terrorist attack and follow his trail throughout the world to uncover his plot.  Eventually, you find out that General Shepard is the one behind the attacks, and everything comes to climax assaulting his hidden base head-on and eventually facing him.</p><p>The final battle is between you, playing "Soap" MacTavish and Captain Price versus General Shepard.  The battle begins with Shepard hopping on a boat and taking off.  Naturally, you and Price grab the second boat and take off after him.  There's lot of rockets, helicopters, and other boats to fight and dodge as you close in Shepard's boat.</p><p>Eventually Shepard gets far enough ahead of you that he boards a helicopter.  Price orders you to steady to boat as he takes a few shots and takes down the helicopter.  Unfortunately, you've gone to far down the rapids and go over a waterfall.</p><p>When you wake, you pull yourself up, take out your knife, and stagger towards the smoldering crashed helicopter.  You find an enemy soldier trying to get away.  You slice him.  You find another one next to the crash, reading his gun.  He pulls the trigger, but it's empty.  You slice him.  A few feet forward, Shepard pops out of the wreck and staggers forward.  You continue after him.  He stops at a wrecked car to catch his breath.  You go in for the kill...  But he catches you, smacks you head on the side of the car, knocks you to the ground, and stabs you in the chest.  The world goes dark.</p><p><b>The Message</b> (spoilers)</p><p>You wake a couple seconds later to Shepard's voice...  "5 years ago, I watched as 30,000 of my men were slaughtered.  All of them died for their country as America sat back and watched.  Tomorrow, thousands will line up to volunteer in this war.  It doesn't matter who started it."  "The Victors write history," he says as he points his revolver in your face.</p><p>It doesn't end there.  Price jumps Shepard as he pulls the trigger, and saves your life.  As Price and Shepard out of your vision, you see the revolver and struggle over to it hitting RT and LT to move.  Shepard gets the upper hand, kicks the gun away, and knocks you out.  You fade in and out of consciousness as they fight.  Shepard gets the upper hand again, but you notice the knife in your chest.</p><p>Here's where Modern Warfare 2 takes a fantastic gameplay cue from <b>Metal Gear Solid 4</b>.  To pull the knife out of your chest, you must bang away at the X button.  You need to HURRY though!  Price is getting his ass kicked.  It takes a lot out of you (the player) to bang away at the button to make the game continue.  It attempts to convey the physicality of what your character is going through.  Through this scene I'm thinking to myself, "C'mon!! You can make it, C'mon! C'mon!"</p><p>After railing that X button for about 20 seconds the knife is out and you chuck it into Shepard's eyeball.  Success!</p><div class='title'><b>Digesting the Message</b></div><p>So, the whole reason this [fictional] war was started was to get America off its fat, lazy, ignorant ass and do something for their country.  There's definitely something to that.</p><p>I think this message gives the Airport Scene relevance by putting you in the shoes of a murderer.  Yeah, there are people out there that do this.  And yeah, this is what happens when you sit by and do nothing.  There are consequences to your inactions.</p><p>One of the quotes presented throughout the game really emphasizes this point:</p><p><em>"A citizen of America will cross the ocean to fight for democracy but won't cross the street to vote in a national election"</em> - Bill Vaughn</p><p>Hopefully the tens of millions of gamers playing Modern Warfare 2 take something from this message and, at the very least, not make the problems in America worse.</p><div class='title'><b>Difficulty</b></div><p>Also, I just beat Modern Warfare 2's campaign on Veteran.  Is this mode supposed to be hard?<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on January 7, 2010<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">January 2010</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">1</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/modern-warfare-2-and-its-message">7</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/not-again">17</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/spring-is-the-new-fall">19</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/i-think-about-video-games-too-much">25</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
