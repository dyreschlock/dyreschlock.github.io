This is on the Xbox.</p><div class='title'><b>Florida</b></div><p>This past Thanksgiving, I went down to Florida and visited my old pal, Justin.  Back in the day, when working at Toys R Us, we played a whole lot of video games together, and talked about them quite a bit.  We don't have identical tastes in gaming, but many of our favorites cross each others paths.  <b>Dragon Age</b> is definitely one of those games, and we spent a good amount of the weekend playing the game and talking about it.</p><p>Previously, I had played about 8 hours into the game, but I added another 10 hours after this weekend.  My human warrior princess saved the mage circle, completed the Shale DLC quest, helped Lelianna out with some personal issues, and then spent a lot of time with her in bed.  <b>Lesbian sex confirmed!</b></p><div class='title'><b>Downloadable Content</b></div><p>Justin had a couple pieces of DLC for Dragon Age on his harddrive, which automatically showed up in my game when I started playing.  My inventory automatically had that Dragon Armor, and a Memory Ring, which boosted experience.  Additionally, the Shale quest line and Warden's quest line opened up on the map.</p><p>I didn't have any of DLC for Dragon Age, since I was merely renting the game.  We had wondered what might happen when I return to my Xbox with all these new items and quests and things that I shouldn't have.  Well...  It labels your save as <b>CORRUPT</b>, that's what.  Even though, I was able to copy the files that contained those items onto my memory card, and even though those files weren't attached to a specific Gamer Profile, the game still didn't recognize them as correct.</p><p>I complained that I needed 4 pieces of DLC to run my save file.  Downloading the "Stone Prisoner" and "Warden's Keep" was an easy task to fix, since those are available on the Xbox Marketplace.  But, the "Dragon Armor" and "Memory Ring" are preorder bonuses.  They aren't available on the marketplace.</p><div class='title'><b>A Fix!</b></div><p>Some dudes are selling their preorder bonuses on eBay.  It didn't long for me to find the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=160381700577" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=160381700577">Memory Ring</a> and the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=250539259767" title="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=250539259767">Dragon Armor</a>.  And they really aren't that expensive.  So, I bought both of these a few hours ago.  I already got a reply from the Memory Ring guy.  I still need the Dragon Armor guy to respond with his code, and then I can play my save file on my console.</p><p>On the main menu of Dragon Age, there's a link for <b>Downloadable Content</b>.  Download codes are entered in here, rather than the Marketplace.  This also has a full list of all the Downloadable content available in this game.</p><p>If you decide to bring your saves around to your friends house's, <b>ensure that the items on this list match your own</b>.  If you have things on this list they don't, you won't be able to play your game.  If they have things on this list that you don't, and you decide to save your game, you will find yourself in the same situation I am.</p><div class='title'><b>No friends?</b></div><p>I guess Bioware expected that whoever was playing their game wasn't going to play it at a friend's house on occasion.  It's a real easy way to lock yourself out of the game, too.  Especially when these items and quests are automatically given to you the first time you log in.  I wonder how many other people have run into this issue, and if Bioware has some sort of solution to this.</p><p>Buying the quest DLC is easy enough, but those preorder bonuses are not available to the public anymore.  How are people supposed to get around that without Bioware issuing a bunch of codes?\</p><div class='title'><b>Dragon Age Online Profile</b></div><p>If you are bringing your Saved Data on a Memory Card over to a friend's house to merely show off your character, you can save yourself a couple steps.  Throughout the game, Dragon Age is sending information to Bioware's servers about everything you do in the game.  Things like complete character information, stats, story choices, achievements, etc.</p><p>Here's my Dragon Age profile: <a href="http://social.bioware.com/playerprofile.php?sku=dragonage1_xbox&amp;nid=2263281259" title="http://social.bioware.com/playerprofile.php?sku=dragonage1_xbox&amp;nid=2263281259">http://social.bioware.com/playerprofile.php?sku=dragonage1_xbox&amp;nid=2263281259</a></p><p>To look at your stuff, and sign up to see it, check out <a href="http://social.bioware.com&lt;/a" title="http://social.bioware.com&lt;/a">social.bioware.com</a>.</p><p><b><u><i>Update!!</i></u></b>: I got both codes from eBay, entered them, and my save files work again.  So, I guess that's what you need to do to fix this problem.  I'll probably play some more tomorrow night.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 30, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 29, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Paul van Dyk @ The Kennedy, Tampa</h3><p>Last week, after seeing <a href="/old/v6/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis" title="/above-beyond-epic-minneapolis">Above &amp; Beyond in Minneapolis</a>, I compared the Electronic Dance scenes in Minneapolis, Milwaukee, and Chicago.  I've always wanted to see how our little corner of the DJ world compared to the major hubs.  Tampa isn't a "major" hub by any means, but Miami absolutely is.  I figured that other major cities in Florida would have quite a bit of crossover.</p><p>I've been to Tampa 4 times now, and all previous times have turned out lame.  But the opportunity finally arose this Thanksgiving as Paul Van Dyk was in town!</p><div class='title'><b>The Kennedy</b></div><p>There was some back and forth as to which Venue he was going to be at.  He was originally scheduled to be at The Kennedy but they moved him over to The Ritz in Ybor City a couple months ago.  Then 2 weeks ago, they moved him back to The Kennedy.  I'm not sure why, but the email said "our original venue has been cleared for PVD, so we're back at The Kennedy."</p><p>The Kennedy is pretty fancy.  It's setup exactly like one of those Night clubs you'd see in some TV show based in Miami (CSI, Burn Notice).  There were lush velvet couches in corned rooms lining the walls, which were roped off for VIPs only.  The edges of the walls were lined shimmering lights.  The wood throughout the place had a cherry finish with intricate designs like an old armoire.  It was a fancy cush little place.</p><p>But that what it's biggest problem.  It was little.  It was about the same size of any bar you've ever been to.  Well, maybe just a little bit bigger.  The Bar area was placed in the middle of the building and consumed almost all the space.  It started at about 40 feet from the DJ booth and continued back from there.  The dance floor was not at all wide either.</p><p>Justin and I got to The Kennedy around 10:30p.  There weren't that many people there, but it was still dense.  An opening DJ was playing songs from somewhere, but the DJ booth was vacant.  Time went by as we waited for PVD to show up, and more and more people filtered into the place.</p><p>By the time Paul Van Dyk showed up at Midnight-ish, I could hardly move.  There were nearly 2000 people in this tiny fucking place.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091127_pvd/IMG_6212.webp"  /></p><p>I have no idea why they decided stuffing us into a fancy little lounge bar was a great idea.  Rukes has some pictures of what The Ritz looks like here: <a href="http://photo.rukes.com/ritzybor/ritzybor.html" title="http://photo.rukes.com/ritzybor/ritzybor.html">http://photo.rukes.com/ritzybor/ritzybor.html</a>.  That would have been so much nicer.</p><div class='title'><b>Paul Van Dyk</b></div><p>Justin and I were crammed against the edge of the dance floor.  It worked out well since I would only have people knocking into me from 2 sides rather than all sides.  We were against a railing which kept us out of the VIP area.  When Paul arrived, he actually walked right past us on the way to the bar.  He hung out there while mini-Paul setup the decks for him.</p><p>20 minutes later he took the stage and pounded our ass with sound.  Here's the beginning:</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="500" height="405" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UWax8OxmmZo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" height="405" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UWax8OxmmZo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><div class='title'><b>Tracklist</b></div><p>He played some amazing stuff throughout the night, but a lot of familiar titles.

Dragon Age had been sitting on my desk all week, barely touched.  But my Sunday was wide open and void of responsibility, so I took the opportunity to relax in the war torn world.</p><p>Dragon Age is the latest game by Canadian developer, Bioware, the renowned western RPG developer. Dragon Age has been described a spiritual successor to <b>Balder's Gate</b>, Bioware's first established series a developer, but has no ties to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.  Dragon Age is a completely new IP, which is part of Bioware's company goal to create their own original games, rather than building off of established franchises, such as D&amp;D or Star Wars.</p><p><b>Jade Empire</b> was actually their first IP, but didn't really have the staying power they were hoping for.  <b>Mass Effect</b> was truly their first success on that front.  Mass Effect certainly wasn't my introduction to the Bioware name, but it was the first Bioware game I played and played through to completion.  I loved the environments, and space travel.  The story was pretty engaging, even though the actual character interactions were stoic and lifeless.  But I liked it a lot.</p><p>Dragon Age definitely learns from areas in Mass Effect that fell short, and expands several concepts that make Dragon Age a very well rounded and fantastic experience.</p><div class='title'><b>The Nameless, Speechless Main Character</b></div><p>In Dragon Age, you play a character that you create using a character creator, much like other recent western RPGs of this era (Oblivion, Fallout 3, Mass Effect).  You do not play a scripted defined main character.  Nothing makes me lose interest in a game faster than playing an absolute husk of a human.  At least in Mass Effect, you actually heard your character speak and interact with people.  In Oblivion, Fallout, and Dragon Age, you make your conversation choices but your character says nothing.  You basically play nothing...</p><p>Though, the point of this is to actually "role play" your character.  You make choices on your own and that shapes the story for yourself.  YOU define the character you play, rather than the writers.  The writers are there to merely give you the choices to either act like yourself, play the good guy, or play the bad guy.</p><p>This has never worked for me.  I never feel like I'm making a character.  I'm just making choices and am hardly ever reminded of the consequences.  Some stats go up, some stats go down.  There's no emotional attachment to anything I do.</p><p>But I don't feel unattached to my character in Dragon Age.  My character, who I almost named "Tina Fey", doesn't ever speak a word, but is constantly surrounded by a party of characters who speak their minds.  Every character I've met in Dragon Age has a distinct personality that is something I've never come across in a western RPG, but something you'd have a hard time NOT finding in a Japanese RPG.</p><p>With the choices you make throughout the story of Dragon Age, your party members remember.  When discussing an upcoming battle, or having trouble making a difficult decision, your party members will not hesitate to give their two cents on the situation, and even argue amongst themselves about what is best.  Sometimes you can join their conversation. Afterward, they may complain about it, and you can set them straight, or perhaps smack your self on the head at what a fool you were.</p><p>You may not have a voice of your own, but your party resonates with who you've become as a character and I find that rather engaging and amazing.</p><div class='title'><b>Choices</b></div><p>The choices you make are chiefly made through the conversations you have with other characters in the world.  Those choices found in Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Mass Effect were generally either "Good" choices, "Evil" choices, or "Neutral" choices, which generally make you a "Good", "Evil" or "Neutral" person.</p><p>The choices presented to you in Dragon Age are much more varied.  In fact, to prevent you from thinking in terms of Good or Evil, they've removed your alignment from the UI.  Choices might still be Good or Evil, but the game doesn't judge you in those terms.  Your party members do, though.</p><p>Each of the characters in your party has a Like and Dislike meter and the choices you make will either piss them off or make them think highly of you.  You can walk around with a bunch of the righteous characters and spread love and joy throughout the land.  Or you can surround yourself with assholes and fuck with people.  Or you can mix it up.</p><p>My party has two goodie two-shoes (Alastair, Lelianna) and one bad apple (Morrigan).  Morrigan will always complain when I decide to help out a villager in need.  "Oh god, are we going to help every single beggar that has a problem?  Don't we have more important business?"  But Lelianna can't get enough of it.  In fact, my friendship level with her is starting to get some special privileges, similar to what happens in Mass Effect if you start getting really close to a party member.</p><p>But there's more than just Good and Evil choices.  Good and Evil are only relative to your party members, and really depends on what they think you should be doing.  Some of these choices might be anti-religion or anti-royalty.  You can mind your manors and speak politely, or be a brass asshole.</p><p>For my character, I'm playing a princess whose castle has fallen and family has been completely killed.  Being a woman chosen as a Grey Warden, I'm not putting up with anyone's shit, but I'm still heading the manors I grew up with.  I will not show weakness in any case.  I'm here to prove that a woman will stop this war.  Girl Power!  Lelianna's with me...</p><div class='title'><b>Only 10 hours in...</b></div><p>I started the game bored off my ass, but after spending a good amount of time paying attention to the game and ignoring any distractions, it has totally pulled me in.  Dragon Age is very organic and genuine compared to Mass Effect, but I think both games emulate their environments.</p><p>Mass Effect has some amazing special effects, but deep down is missing the warmth of emotion.  The story focuses on all these things that are going on around you, but you are never affected by them.  No one ever says how they feel or expresses any emotion about the Geth invasion, or Saren.  There's nothing personal.</p><p>Dragon Age is all about the people in this world.  The Horde of Demons is almost identical to the Geth Invasion in Mass Effect, but the people you meet will always mention what they're feeling.  And you have enough dialogue choices that you can add to that conversation.</p><p>I hope the Mass Effect team and Dragon Age team have some cross design ideas that aided the development of both games because without these ideas, I think Mass Effect 2 will be a weaker game.</p><p>Anyways, Dragon Age is pretty great so far.  I just need another uninterrupted weekend day to spend 8 hours with it.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 24, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 23, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Above &amp; Beyond @ Epic, Minneapolis</h3><p>November continues to sound with amazing talent in the midwest and this weekend was one of the biggest.  Above &amp; Beyond came through Minneapolis and Chicago.  And Deadmau5 stopped in Chicago and Detriot.  A couple of months ago, I started listening to Deadmau5 and was quite excited to find out he'd be in Chicago soon enough.  Well, after waiting too long to form a party, Deadmau5 sold out without me...

Boom Jinx played tracks nearly identical to the Trance I started off on around a decade ago.  The simple beauty of build ups and tear downs in an absolute aura of melody.  It was a warm feeling to hear that sound again.  But it certainly made me question the evening.</p><p>Over the past years, I've paid most attention to Sasha, Digweed, Moby, Ladytron, Way out West (Jody Wisternoff and Nick Warren), and the DJs of Hybridized.org.  Way out West was really my only link back to Trance, and both Jody and Nick are almost exclusively Progressive House now.  I've heard a few things from Armin and Paul Van Dyk, but never followed up.</p><p>It was odd to think that Trance hadn't evolved at all in the past 10 years, if this is what Trance today sounded like.  Of course, once Above &amp; Beyond took the stage and blew everyone away (ign dot com), I was foolish to have ever thought that.  Though, most of Above &amp; Beyond's set had a very House style to it, in a similar manor to how Paul Van Dyk sounds these days.  Once Trance, now a Housey Trance which PVD refers to simply as EDM, or <b>Electronic Dance Music</b>.</p><p>I find this odd, since the term itself implies it covers the entire genre of music, rather than just a sub-genre.  Maybe with using this blanket term, they're trying to get everyone else on earth to stop calling electronic music "Techno", and start calling it "Electronic Dance Music" or "EDM" or whatever.  It would make sense since most the <a href="http://www.djmag.com/top100" title="http://www.djmag.com/top100">Top 10 DJs in the World</a> play tracks in genres that either <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> EDM or at least orbit it.</p><p>Do people still refer to electronic music as "Techno" anyways?  The only group I can think of who might even be considered in that sub-genre are The Crystal Method.</p><div class='title'><b>Minneapolis</b></div><p>As mentioned before, this was Plan B for Friday Night.  Though, I could've saved the 4.5 hour drive to Minneapolis and gone to Above &amp; Beyond in Chicago (2.5 hour drive) on Saturday Night instead.  They were at Vision in Chicago, though, and I'm getting rather sick of that place.</p><p>The vast majority of people who go to Vision are those only interested in the night life rather than the music.  It was a bit of an eye opener going to the House of Blues are being completely surrounded with genuine fans, rather than a bunch of douche bags with popped collars, dark glasses, glamour muscles and are only there to be "seen".</p><p>Minneapolis' "scene" was born out of raves.  All of the kids back in the 90s who partied in barns and rundown community centers, run and contribute to the nightlife these days.  That genuine fandom and experience makes Minneapolis one of the best places in the nation to hear any EDM performance.</p><p>For proof of Minneapolis' fantastic electronic music community, you need only check out <a href="http://mnvibe.com/" title="http://mnvibe.com/">MN Vibe</a>, which was fostered and promoted talent for the past 8 years.  Not to mention, <a href="http://simshows.com/" title="http://simshows.com/">Sound In Motion</a> who are the ones that bring all the fantastic talent to Minneapolis.</p><div class='title'><b>Boom Jinx</b></div><p>But anyways, Boom Jinx played some pretty rad songs.

Nick Nice has been around Madison for quite a while.  He's always opening for shows at the Majestic and the headlining 80s v. 90s nights at Majestic.  He seems to wear several different musical hats.</p><p>This was the first time I had actually heard anything he's done.  I was pleasantly surprised when he began his set with some very melodic ambient progressive tracks.  Those first two or three songs he played were amazing.  Once more and more people arrived and there filled the dance floor, he quickly transitioned out of the layers and into some god awful house music.</p><p>Ugh... Why would you do that?  You spent 20 or 30 minutes building up this wonderful sound, and then through it all away for this crap.  Not all House music is bad, but when it carries no melody, no progression, or anything interesting at all, there's absolutely no point.  It's background noise.  And then he throws in a hard electro track out of nowhere.</p><p>Overall his set made no cohesive sense at all.  He started off brilliantly, but it turned into a mish mash of song that had no business being with each other.</p><div class='title'><b>Future Rock</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091111_futurerock/IMG_5899.webp"  /></p><p>Future Rock were pretty incredible though.  I actually hadn't heard of them or any of their music prior to going to this concert.  I looked them up on youtube for about 10 minutes, and then bought the tickets, but that's about it.</p><p>The band seems somewhat outdated.  The name, Future Rock, sounds like something you'd hear in the 70s or 80s.  Especially with the heavy use of Keyboards.  The band members themselves look like they're in their 40s.  I wonder if they made this band in the 80s..  Or if they made it as a retro throw-back to those ideals.</p><p>They definitely sound like they're from that era.  The keyboards scream "Future" in terms of the past, like an old Science Fiction movie or Tangerine Dream album.  It's really neat. ^_^</p><p>Here's their opening song...</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/YhhRpY1ENXo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/YhhRpY1ENXo&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>I decided to leave somewhat early.  I listened to them for over an hour.  Around a midnight they finished a set, and said, "Oh Madison, we're just getting started!"  If I hadn't been sick all week, and actually had been sleeping enough, I totally would've stayed until 1am or 2am.  But, I did the responsible thing and got home to sleep enough for work the next day.  Yeah yeah...</p><p>But it was fun.  The Majestic was completely full with young college kids too.

MSTRKRFT were pretty damn amazing, and La Doche Vita were pretty awesome, too.  But, The Rave is a fucking pit.  A dank disgusting disease ridden shithole that I will genuinely need to reconsider visiting.</p><div class='title'><b>Electro and Youth</b></div><p>It was pretty great seeing a vast amount of actual electronic music fans at this event.  The past couple times that I've been to The Rave definitely had fans of the music, but it really wasn't Milwaukee's scene.  Milwaukee has greater roots in Metal and Punk, rather than a bunch of raver kids.  Minneapolis and Chicago are the real hubs around here for that kind of music.  Maybe that scene traveled from somewhere else into Milwaukee tonight for MSTRKRFT?</p><p>Though, additionally, MSTRKRFT and Electro House music generally garners a different crowd than the music that introduced me into Electronica.  The Electro House genre is pretty new and is still exploding with new talent every year.  With its arrival brings a new generation of kids into the electronic music sub-genre and sparks it with the energy of youth.  The general age of the crowd was kinda young.  Much younger than the crowd for <a href="/old/v6/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee" title="/the-crystal-method-the-rave-milwaukee">The Crystal Method</a> a couple months ago.</p><p>That endless amount of youthful energy feeds from the powerful charge of Electro.</p><div class='title'><b>MSTRKRFT</b></div><p>These guys continue to push and develop the genre how they see fit.  MSTRKRFT are the ones basically writing the definition of Electro House.  It's amazing how most other Electro DJs follow in their footsteps, but are still one or two steps behind.  MSTRKRFT keep a distinct sound for themselves that completely sets them apart from the rest.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5836.webp"  /></p><p>I was confused about when they were going to perform.  When we arrived, it looked like JFK (Jesse F. Keeler of MSTRKRFT) was already up on stage with another dude..  Once they finished, and after La Doche Vita performed, fucking DJ Funk took the stage and completely ruined the vibe.  Is DJ Funk a legitimate DJ?  or a mock DJ?  I couldn't tell if it was a joke..  Leif and I left the room and went to the other area with some locals spinnin' songs.  After a little while, we checked the main room again, and they were on stage, huzzah.</p><p>It was pretty incredible.  I'm not very current on Electro at all, but when it's on, it's on.  They played some amazing songs including one of my favorites, "D.A.N.C.E" by Justice, which I captured some on video..</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/oFMlQEqRqUw&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091107_mstrkrft/IMG_5822.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>La Doche Vita</b></div><p>Right before DJ Funk nearly ruined the evening, La Doche Vita performed a pretty great set themselves.  They mentioned they're originally from Milwaukee, but got their start down in Chicago.  They are a very young duo having only formed in 2008, but since then, have made some incredible remixes of The Faint, The Prodigy, Femme Fatality..  They have a couple of these remixes available on their <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita" title="http://www.myspace.com/ladolcevita">MySpace page</a>.</p><p>Their set consisted heavily of these types of remixes.  Leif was able to pick out Smashing Pumpkins, Radiohead, The Prodigy..  One of my favorite songs of the night was a remix of The Prodigy's "Smack my Bitch up" set against Deadmau5's "Ghosts 'n Stuff".

Cigarette smoke had never bothered me to the point of rioting, but it's subtle benefits are great.  My clothes aren't disgusting the next day and the air inside those bars and clubs are quite clean and occasionally refreshing.</p><p>The Smoking Ban has been yet to extend itself to Milwaukee, or at least this part of Milwaukee.  It's never been a problem for me before.  But my throat has been screwed up from food poisoning earlier this week and hadn't fully healed, yet.  Obviously yelling really loud wasn't a good idea, but with everyone smoking as if they needed it to live,  the polluted air was extra damaging.  My voice is pretty screwed up today.</p><p>Also, on the way home, I started feeling some pain in my left eye.  It was really annoying, and made me tear profusely.  It wasn't particular painful.  It just felt like something was stuck in my eye.  When I got home, my eye was a little puffy.  That's happened before..  nothing new there.  I just went to bed.  This morning my eye was inflamed.  It had fuse shut with all the gunk it excreted throughout the night.  It looked pretty gross.  A quick search of the symptoms and yep, I have pink eye.</p><p>How the hell do you get Pink Eye from going to a concert?  Especially when I hadn't touched a single thing inside the place at all.  Some website mentioned "sensitivity to light" being a cause.  Could a constant bright strobe light pointed at my face cause my eye to burst out in Pink Eye?  I've been going to clubs and concerts for years with like setups, and this has never happened.</p><p>Fucking diseased, smoke ridden venue...  Never again!<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 8, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 7, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Goroawase 語呂合わせ</h3><p>Yesterday, at work, I was talking with one of the project managers about the Konami Code.  We have <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/" title="http://code.google.com/p/fxspy/">Flex Spy</a> setup in our Flex App, but we only want Users logged into the omni-user account to use it, and even then, we don't want it displayed at inappropriate times.  Why not implement the Konami Code?  When an omni-user keys in the code while using our app, it'll appear!</p><p>I think everyone in my age group knows what the Konami Code is, but might not necessarily know it by name.  This code showed up in almost all of Konami's arcade style games starting with the NES in the late 80s up through today.  The Konami Code is as follows...</p><p>Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Select, Start.</p><p>I sent the project manager a link to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code">Wikipedia Page</a>.  After glancing over the article real quick, I noticed a little piece of information that solved a mystery that sat around in my head for years and years.</p><p><em>In Mobile phone games by Konami, B A are substituted with 5 7 3 on the numerical pad, which is the goroawase pronunciation for "konami."</em></p><p>573!  I have seen that number all over the place in Konami games.  I first noticed this when I saw that every single Konami Arcade game has a default high score of 57300.  I had no idea why that was significant, but it was consistent.</p><div class='title'><b>Goroawase</b></div><p>Goroawase uses the native Japanese reading (kun'yomi), the Japanese approximation of Chinese reading (on'yomi), and the English reading to describe a word in the form of a number.  The Wiki page has a wonderful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">chart</a> showing each reading for each number.</p><p>The normal reading of 573 in Japanese is "go-shichi-san".  For 7 and 3, we want to use the native Japanese pronunciation, so it would be "go-nana-mitsu".  If we use the base kana for "go", and just the first syllables of 7 and 3, we get "ko-na-mi".</p><p>This is used in various places throughout gaming.  In Dance Dance Revolution, there's a Song called ".59".  In Japanese, the period is pronounced 'ten'.  So with that, the reading would be "Ten-go-ku", which translates as "Heaven" in English.  You might also know Japanese Video Game Designer, Suda Goichi, who writes his name Suda 51.  His name gets mispronounced all the time in the states as Suda Fifty-One.</p><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goroawase#Goroawase">Wiki Article</a> has a couple more examples that are interesting ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on November 7, 2009<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">November 7, 2009</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Happy Carl Sagan Day!</h3><p>Happy <a href="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/">Carl Sagan Day</a> everyone!  Today is the first annual celebration of the life of Carl Sagan, the great astronomer, author and philosopher.  75 years ago, he was brought into this world and his inspiration and passion has inspired and affected us all.  Carl Sagan passed away in 1996, but his legacy lives on in those he inspired, especially in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imS6H1JAkGY" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imS6H1JAkGY">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Contact</b></div><p>I think a lot of people's first encounter with Carl Sagan was the movie Contact, at least, for those not actively participating in the field of astronomy or philosophy.  Contact is a film released in 1997 staring Jodie Foster and teen hunk Matthew McConaughey.  It's based on the Science-Fiction novel, written by Carl Sagan.  It was my introduction to his philosophy and interest towards god and extraterrestrial life.  I really liked Contact, but it didn't inspire me to look into the concepts any further.  It was a piece of Science Fiction, and I basically treated it that way.</p><p>I haven't read Contact the novel, but I have the feeling that the story and SciFi aspects prominently displayed in the movie were really just a vehicle to talk about the greater concepts.  The possibility of technological advanced life in our universe, and whether the belief of a higher power is truly representative of our species.</p><div class='title'><b>A Glorious Dawn</b></div><p>It wasn't until recently that I became a big fan on Carl Sagan.  Like usual, it was something on the Internet that inspired and peaked my interest.  2 months ago, on September 17th, 2009, mild mannered John Boswell, released an auto-tuned music video of the Internet composed of quotes and clips from Carl Sagan's award-winning 1980 TV series Cosmos.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zSgiXGELjbc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/zSgiXGELjbc&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>After listening to A Glorious Dawn, I could not get it out of my head.  It had infected me with its soft low key melody and powerful important message.  I must've listened to this song several hundred times already.  I downloaded the mp3, I downloaded the mpeg video.</p><p>Since the debut of Glorious Dawn on YouTube is has become the #1 highest rated video of all time.  It has become so popular that Boswell started the <b>Symphony of Science</b>, a musical project to bring the thoughts and works of the greatest scientific minds of our lifetime into song and inspire the world to care about Science!</p><p>Additionally, for Carl Sagan Day, A Glorious Dawn will be released as a single through Third Man Records.  Side A will contain A Glorious Dawn, and Side B will contain a reproduction of the contents of the golden record encased in the Voyager space probes launched from earth in the late 70s!  You can get that here: <a href="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html" title="http://www.thirdmanrecords.com/storeus.html">Third Man Records</a>.  I ordered my copy. ^_^</p><p>Also, additionally, Symphony of Science has released a second song, "We are all Connected", featuring Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Neil deGrasse Tyson, and Bill Nye. ^_^</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XGK84Poeynk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XGK84Poeynk&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;color1=0x3a3a3a&amp;color2=0x999999" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>All songs and videos are available on the Symphony of Science website at <a href="http://www.symphonyofscience.com/" title="http://www.symphonyofscience.com/">http://www.symphonyofscience.com/</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Cosmos</b></div><p>I was an immediate fan of Boswell, but he was really just the messenger.  The real beauty of Glorious Dawn was Carl Sagan and the thoughts behind all the concepts mentioned in the song.</p><p><em>"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe."</em></p><p><em>"The sky calls to us.  If we do not destory ourselves, we'll one day venture to the stars."</em></p><p><em>"The Cosmos is full behind measure of elegant truths of the exquisite interrelationships of the awesome machinery of nature."</em></p><p><em>"The simplest thought like the concept of the number one has an elaborate logical underpinning."</em></p><p>Carl Sagan has an extraordinary talent of talking about incredibly large and complex topics in a very straight forward, direct, easy-to-understand manor.  It just so happens that entire series of Cosmos is available on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPxqTyjSZM" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqPxqTyjSZM">YouTube</a> and <a href="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos" title="http://www.hulu.com/cosmos">Hulu</a>.  Over the course of a week or two, I watched the entire show, while playing Katamari Forever.</p><p>Cosmos was originally made in 1980.  All these episodes are the 1990 versions with updates included at the end of the episodes to talk about the advancements made in those 10 years relative the subject manor in each episode.</p><p>In many ways, Cosmos is Carl Sagan's message to us.  It's a message of fact explaining the universe and how it personally relates to us.  It's a message of passion demonstrating the magnitude of who and what we are.  It's a message of imagination challenging your mind to expand itself beyond your limitations.  And it's a message of love, so to speak, pleading with the world to end needless war.</p><p>It's an amazing 13 episode journey that is a display of earth's greatest scientific achievements.  Even though, it's almost 30 years old, the passionate, powerful message is timeless.. We are all one species..  We have evolved because of our nack of exploration, curiosity, imagination, and togetherness.  We must embrace each other and embark on the next journey of discovery.. to the stars.</p><p>If you haven't seen Cosmos, definitely check it out.  It's entirely online for free! ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Happy Carl Sagan Day!</b></div><p>Have a great day everyone!  Though, I'm somewhat confused as to which actual day Carl Sagan day is supposed to be.  <a href="http://carlsaganday.com/" title="http://carlsaganday.com/">Carl Sagan Day dot Com</a> says it's supposed to be today on November 7th, the anniversary of his birth.  However, Wikipedia says his birthday is on the 9th.  That's also when the Glorious Dawn single is released..  Who knows..

I bought an eBay store, and started listing VHS tapes, DVDs, Video Games, Music, Action Figures, and other things on Half.com and eBay.  Throughout the following months, it was incredibly successful.  There were weeks when I'd have as much as 5 packages to send out each day.  Things eventually died down, but there have been <a href="/old/v6/schlock-for-sale-restock" title="/schlock-for-sale-restock">restock days</a> every now and then.</p><p>Action figures have been the most annoying items to send because there really isn't a standard issue box to accomodate the variety of dimensions.  Some are taller, some are fatter, some are heavy, some are fragile.  Eventually, I came across a pretty effecient way to box them, and I'd like to share that with you.</p><div class='title'><b>How I box an action figure</b></div><p>For every action figure I sell, I create a completely custom box to ship it in.  In order to create a box from nothing, I needed some cardboard.  Cardboard is VERY easy to come by if you live in an apartment building that frequenty changes residents.  One day I found two HUGE U-haul boxes in the recycling bin, which have served me incredibly well.  I dragged those back to my apartment and stuffed them in our extra closet.  I've found some more boxes over the months, so they've begun to pile up...</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5626.webp"  /></p><div class='title'><b>Cutting</b></div><p>With the largest chunk of cardboard, I begin measuring the dimensions of the action figure on the box.  Though, usually, I just begin cutting with a box cutter.  The dimensions don't have to be exact because cardboard bends and shape very easily.  It's a great medium for builing sculptures. ^_^</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5623.webp"  /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091031_ebay/IMG_5624.webp"  /></p><p>There's one piece cut.

If you're going to dine for Japanese tonight, I would definitely recommend any other Japanese restaurant in Madison.  Takumi and Sushi Muramoto are absolutely delicious for Sushi, and Ginza and Takara are fantastic too with a more well-rounded menu.</p><p>I don't want to bash on the place because I love Japanese food and it's great to see a new restaurant open that isn't just Sushi or Teppanyaki and has more variety, but...  you can do better.</p><p>I really wish a Ramen restaurant would open in Madison or somewhere nearby.

The amount of talented musicians I've seen this month dwarf the entire year.  Seeing Moby Live for the first time was amazing, and John Digweed was incredibly powerful.  Dark Dark Dark came to town, and so did MC Chris along with his openers.  Each performance made me more and more excited for what was to end the month.  Sasha was returning to the midwest, and the day had finally arrived.</p><div class='title'><b>House of Blues</b></div><p>This was my first time to the House of Blues.  I've been to several clubs and venues in Chicago, but always manage to avoid the House of Blues somehow.  The House of Blues is somewhat close to Visions and Soundbar.  But unlike those clubs, House of Blues is more a venue.  It has an actual prominent stage that can be seen from almost anywhere in the place.  It's very easy to move around and talk with people too.</p><p>Being a venue, the people who attended the show were actual music fans.  It's quite a difference than the normal douchebag crowd you'd find at Visions.  It was rather refreshing.  Dave and I talked with a dude in the line about music while we waited.  And I talked with a few people inside too.  I'll certainly see some music nerds at Visions, but they are not as prominent as the rest of the club scene.</p><div class='title'><b>Hernan Cattaneo</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5548.webp"  /></p><p>Dave and I arrived at the House of Blues around 11pm and completely missed Chris Walsh and Wahi opening for Hernan Cattaneo.  This was my first time seeing him live.  And really, it was first time even listening to his music too.</p><p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/_j_lEcpFlG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/_j_lEcpFlG4&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p><p>His sound was incredibly hard and deep.  It also echoed Electro to a degree.. but overall, very Tribal.  It was pretty damn amazing.  Though, I found it curious that he played at least 2 songs that Wahi played 3 weeks ago when Digweed was in town.  Hernan's tracks followed a somewhat predictable pattern, but that's not necessary a bad thing.  It made them more accessible and very easy to move to.  I definitely need to listen to this man some more. ^_^</p><div class='title'><b>Sasha</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/091030_sasha/IMG_5561.webp"  /></p><p>The tone of the atmosphere changed pretty quickly once Sasha got a hold of the decks.  The predictability went out the window.  And the sound became incredibly layered and ambient.  His selections were very organic.  The type of sound that fuses and shakes your body.  Like the rhythm of a heartbeat or the slapping of wooden instruments.</p><p>It was pretty amazing, too.  For a few years, I felt like I was drifting away from Sasha.  I felt like his sets were pretty solid and technically astounding, but lacked the variety that really made me a huge fan to begin with.  His set on this night felt like he was definitely returning to what made him an excellent DJ in the first place.</p><p>Mixing sounds that put him in a genre of his own, rather than simply Prog House.  It was all about layers.  Sounds building on other sounds.  Slowly building and slowly tearing down and slowly transitioning.
