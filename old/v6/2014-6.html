This company was established in 1974 and created almost anything out of wood, from as small as keychains and children's toys, to as large as homes and office buildings.</p><p>The Oak Village stand by 3 principles:</p><p><b>Craftsmanship with a 100-year guarantee</b> <i>"We strive to create products that will last at least as many years as the age of the trees used in those products.  It is our way of paying respect to the forests from which we receive great resources, and in the meanwhile, we can plant and nurture trees to grow new forests."</i></p><p><b>From Bowls to Buildings</b> <i>"Using solid wood (as opposed to plywood or veneer), we use different parts of a given tree for different purposes.  We create a wide range of wooden products, ranging from small articles like accessories and tableware, to larger items like furniture, and we also specialize in wooden architecture.  Through our products we hope to support the needs of a sustainable lifestyle."</i></p><p><b>One Acorn for Every Child</b> <i>"If we take one tree from a forest, we must give one back.  Out of this belief, we created a sister NPO, Donguri no Kai (Acorn Club), which plants and nurtures tree saplings, and maintain healthy forests in various places in Japan.  We hope to create a sustainable cycle of resource usage and renewal."</i></p><p>This year they're celebrating their 40th anniversary.  The Oak Village began with five men working on wood-crafts in a barn.  They continued to make high quality products.  That became their hallmark, and gave them success.  The products they created were born out of the 1000year woodcrafting tradition of Kiyomi with modern advancements of treating woods, and modern styles, as well.  Everything created in the Oak Village is 100% natural, and 100% made from resources of Japan.</p><div class='title'><b>Kiyomi Location</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9076.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8991.webp" /></p><p>It's located a few kilometers west of the Takayama Nishi highway exit, and in the middle of the woods they craft and carve into usable and useful items.  Just follow the numerous signs.  The only building open to the public is on your right side.  This building essentially has four areas.  </p><p>When you approach the entrance, on your left, there's a cafe.  They sell plenty of coffee, and some treats.  There's plenty of locally produced Kiyomi goods, too.  On most weekends, they'll provide live music.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9043.webp" /></p><p>On your right is the gift shop.  Here you will find the smallest items crafted at Oak Village.  Some keychains, goblets, eye glass cases, business card cases, picture frames, children's toys, and so forth.</p><p>Most of these things are pretty expensive.  Many of the small items range between 3000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($30) and 10000<span class='ja'>円</span> ($100).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9039.webp" /></p><p>Through the gift shop, you can proceed downstairs, and view their larger items.  In the room underneath the gift shop, there are cabinets, tables, and chairs or various sizes.</p><p>Some of the smallest chairs and cabinets cost 4<span class='ja'>万円</span> ($400), but when buying some of the larger sets together, they can cost 40<span class='ja'>万円</span> ($4000).</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_8996.webp" /></p><p>Then, finally, past the furniture showroom, you can find the "reform" gallery, and oak village museum.</p><p>On the wall, they show off their best works, which include houses built from scratch.  Models are shown along with photos illustrating their designs and handiwork with the woods they're so comfortable with.  On the opposite side of the room, the show the type of woods used, and their process for building such sturdy and beautiful structures.</p><p>I think you could probably imagine how much any of these kinds of products would cost.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_9044.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Buying Stuff</b></div><p>The reason I came to the Oak Village on this day was to purchase a business card holder for my newly printed cards.  I bought a beautiful cherry finished and lacquered case that cost 7500<span class='ja'>円</span> ($75).  Quite expensive, but it looks really nice. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2525.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_oak_village/IMG_2545.webp" /></p><p>In addition, I bought a book, too.  The book contains 15 oak hearts, which are basically wood samples from all the species of tree they use in their products.  You can feel and smell each wood.  It comes with another book that shows a photo of the grown tree, and explains its history and use.</p><p>They gave me some more brochures and catalogues, too, that showcase their most recent furniture creations.  They gave me a copy of their quarterly magazine, too, which features articles of their past and current architectural plans.</p><p>Feel free to take a look at their website: <a href="http://oakv.co.jp/" title="http://oakv.co.jp/">http://oakv.co.jp/</a>.  Anything available at their Kiyomi location, is available online, too.  I don't know about shipping though.</p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 25, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 23, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Car Wash Graveyard</h3><p>This past weekend, I drove around within the concentrated areas of Kiyomi.  I was looking for some areas marked on a mark that apparently no longer existed.  And I happen to come across the following:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9079.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9079.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9079.webp" /></p><p>...a car wash graveyard!</p><p>In the middle of this farming neighborhood were 15 derelict car washing units, along with spare parts and a few other various gas station related machinery.  It was so weird to see so many of these things organized in one place.  Especially since there are only 2 gas stations in all of Kiyomi.</p><p class='img'><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9084_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9084_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9084_stitch.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9098.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9098.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9098.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9102.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9102.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140621_carwash/IMG_9102.webp" /></p><p>I was about to get a closer look at some of the machinery when I noticed a fairly large spider nestled in the cloth of the scrubbing unit thing.</p><p>Anyway, I thought this was a rather weird thing to come across.  I guess the actual junk yard didn't have any room, or some gas station chain in another village needed extra space to dump their used car washes.  I dunno.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 23, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 18, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Takaoka Marathon 2014</h3><p>Last weekend, I attended the Takaoka Half Marathon for the second time.  Last year, the race was in November, and it was a much cooler day.  I wrote about that here: <a href="/old/v6/takaoka-marathon" title="/takaoka-marathon">November 18th</a>.  </p><p>Last year, although, I trained and was in alright shape, the time limits set by the race prevented me from finishing.  I made it to the 17.3km gate at 1 minute too late.  So, I definitely planned on signing up again and vowing to complete the marathon!</p><div class='title'><b>This Year</b></div><p>Well, I did not train nearly as much as I did last year.  Last year, there were other people I signed up with, and we trained a few times together, and had some fun.  We were a team.  This year, it was just me.  And I had been so busy and tired with school that I barely trained at all.  I am still doing Kendo, but even then, I still occasionally miss Kendo practice due to the amount work needed to teach at my schools.</p><p>So, I was not nearly in the shape I was last year.  I was totally prepared for not finishing.  In fact, my time probably would've been better spent had I simply skipped the event.  But whatever…  I'll still drive down there, and make it as far as I can.</p><div class='title'><b>The Race</b></div><p>This year's course was identical to last year's.  Of course, this year it was in June, rather than November.  The morning wasn't too bad.  There was a nice breeze, and the clouds prevented the sun from heating everyone up.</p><p>At 8:30am, they had the opening ceremony, where the Takaoka athletic association said some words, and last year's winners came up to the front and said their words, too.  Blah blah blah, I have no idea what they said.</p><p>After the opening ceremony, the half marathon race was the first to gather at the starting line.  Then the clouds started to open up and let the sun in.  Ugh, it was hot.  At 9am, some old guy fired his starting pistol and everyone was off.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0712.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0715.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Time Limits</b></div><p>Once again, just like last year, the race had a time limit of 2 hours and 30 minutes.  This limit is enforced by 2 intermediary checkpoints throughout the race.  The first checkpoint is at 12.7km for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The second checkpoint is at 17.3km for 2 hours.  If you make it to these checkpoints late, the volunteers will stop you, and force you to quite.  Then you must wait for a bus to pick you up and bring you back to the start.  </p><p>Last year, I made the first checkpoint, but could not pass the second one.  I was only 1 minute late. :/</p><p>With the shape I was in this year, I had no intention of doing any better.  In order to complete the checkpoints, and the race, I needed to keep a pace of less than 7 minutes per kilometer (that's around 11 minutes per mile).</p><p>Whatever… let's get this marathon over with.</p><div class='title'><b>Running</b></div><p>Again, the course was the same.  But, since I was running at a much more leisurely pace, I stopped to take a few more photos than last year.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0718.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0724.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0729.webp" /></p><p>I really tried at the beginning, but after 2k, my body was too fat, and heavy, and I was not going to have the energy to overcome it.  Additionally, I kept thinking about all the crap still outstanding on my to-do list, and the increasingly little time I had to complete them.  Ugh, why am I here?  Why am I doing this?  This isn't fun.  I'm not really getting anything out of this either.</p><p>The increasing pressure of all my responsibilities kept me from actually enjoying the run, and thinking about things clearly.  Usually during a marathon, I can push away all of my thoughts, empty my mind, and think about things without any noise.  My brain stops trying to analyze everything, and I can simply think…</p><p>All I could think about were my upcoming classes, and all the preparation work I still needed to do, and try to figure out when I could actually do the work.  And then think about my classes after, and how was I going to have the energy to do any of this after running this race.</p><p>So, this marathon sucked, and I did terrible at it.  Though, there were a few sparing moments I could lose myself in my music, but then came the crushing reality of my fat ass.</p><div class='title'><b>"Finishing"</b></div><p>Anyway, at around 10 o'clock, I passed the 9km marker.  I quickly thought to myself that I was still alright for time.  Only 3km left to the 12km checkpoint.  I can make that in 30 minutes.  15 minutes later, I remembered that the checkpoint was actually 12.7km, and that my pace was terrible.</p><p>I passed the 12km before the 10:30 mark, but arrived at the checkpoint more than 6 minutes late.</p><p>Whooo, failure!</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0751.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0753.webp" /></p><p>I wasn't the only one there, and there were still people behind me, too.  I still have not broken my cardinal rule of not placing last in a race.  I was only 7th or 8th from last!</p><p>Once everyone else behind us got to the checkpoint, the bus of shame arrived to transport everyone back to the start.  We traversed the course backwards, and made it back to the start before 11am.  So, there were still people finishing the race as we arrived.  Our tracking chips were returned in the bus, though, so we couldn't just jump back on the track and finish the race. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140608_takaoka/IMG_0755.webp" /></p><p>So, while I didn't finish the race, and did much more horribly than last year, I was able to leave much earlier and not damage my legs too much.  The race was still finishing as I walked back to my car to return to Takayama.</p><div class='title'><b>Vow</b></div><p>I still vow to complete this race in the future!  I wonder if this race happens twice a year, which explains the date change from last year.  November was way more comfortable to run, too.  The heat was terrible for this race. :(<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 18, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 16, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Tomodachi Life - Fashion Catalog</h3><p>Last week, Nintendo released <b>Tomodachi Life</b> on the Nintendo 3DS in the US.  It's a life simulation game which you create, or import Miis on your island, and they all live together, make friends with each other, marry each other, and have children. :)  Also, you give your Mii presents, and feed them, which makes their happiness meter go up.  They gain levels this way.  Each new level awards them with a special gift, either a catch phrase, a song, or some kind of permanent present.</p><p>The entertainment of the game is creating a bunch of Miis of your friends, or celebrities, and having them all interact with each other.</p><p>For example, the female Matt Rorey (of Giant Bomb) had feelings for Batman, so she confessed her love.  But then Samus broke in and confessed her love.  Batman chose Samus, and eventually they got married.  Matt Rorey eventually got over Batman when Shaq O'Neil confessed his love for her.  A few days later Matt Rorey asked Shaq for marriage, and he said yes. :)</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQJYRfCEAAVCUa.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Here's some of the Miis at their wedding.  There's Jesse Pinkman, me, Miyamoto, Tyrion Lannister, Alex Nevarro (of Giant Bomb), Batman, Weird Al, and Mr. Bean.</p><div class='title'><b>QR Codes</b></div><p>A really nice feature of Tomodachi Life is being able to share your Mii across the Internet using a QR Code.  Through the menus in the game, you can generate a code for yourself, and others can import you in their game.  It only imports my likeness, and settings.  I can't actually interact with anyone.  But the Miis basically just do whatever they want anyway.</p><p>Here's my Mii, if you'd like me in your game:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tomodachi/BqQZYpVCUAAzKL6.jpg_large.webp" /></p><p>Additionally, Nintendo has created some special Miis based on celebrities you can import into your game with custom backgrounds, and clothes.  There's Christina Aguilera, Shaquille O'Neal, Debby Ryan, Shaun White, and Zendaya.  You can find those codes <a href="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/" title="http://tomodachi.nintendo.com/sharing-miis/">here</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>Japanese Special Miis</b></div><p>It's been over a year since its release in Japan.  I figured that they did something similar with the Japanese release.  It took me a while to find any official Miis for the game, but eventually I found <a href="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html" title="http://channel8083.blog.jp/archives/4461386.html">this website</a>.</p><p>A few months after the Japanese release in April 2013, Club Nintendo released a book called <b>Tomodachi Collection - Fashion Catalog</b>.  It's 88 pages of custom Miis showing off various clothing items you can collect in the game.  Here's the <a href="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html" title="http://club.nintendo.jp/present/P165/index.html">official page</a>.</p><p>Since I wanted a ton of Miis, I went through an imported each one.  They each have gold pants, too!  But, all of them have Japanese names, which my US game won't pronounce.  Since they're special, I can't edit them either.</p><p>Additionally, I have no idea who they are.  Are all these Miis based on Japanese celebrities?  Or are they athletes.  I don't know, so I'm gonna go through each one and write up my findings.</p><div class='title'><b>Findings</b></div><p>Well, it didn't take too long after searching for these characters to realize they're all made up.  </p><p>Unlike the celebrity Miis on Nintendo of America's website, these characters were specifically made up for this catalog.  Throughout the catalog, the Miis show off all these clothes.  Every clothing item in the catalog is attached to the Mii character, so when you import them into your game, you get all their items.  But, then you're stuck with this Mii.</p><p><b>None of this works in the US version of the game.</b>  When you import the Mii, you're given the stock Mii character and none of their items.  So, they're really pointless, unless you want to expand the Mii population of game quickly.  Also, since they're special, if you delete them, you cannot reimport them.  Maybe in the future, Nintendo will patch the game for these Miis to work.  But even so, I've already imported them, so I've already ruined that chance.</p><p>All in all, <b>there's very little use to actually importing these characters in your America game</b>.  But, here's all the codes if you want a bunch of gold panted Miis in your game:</p><p class='img'><div class="columns"><br/><div class="column"><img

This contest is usually held at the end of May, or beginning of June, and it's separate from the regional speech contest that leads to the nationals.  This contest is Takayama only, and allows the top 25 (or so) students to study abroad for a week in either the United States or Australia.</p><p>This year, the contest was held on <b>Saturday, May 31st</b>.</p><div class='title'><b>Participation</b></div><p>Last year, I taught at Higashiyama JHS <span class='ja'>東山中</span> and we had 8 students participate in the contest.  Overall, there were 81 participates.  One of my students got 2nd in the contest!  And overall, 2 Higashiyama students were able to study abroad.</p><p>This year, I'm teaching at Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span>, which is a much smaller school then Higashiyama.  There's around 70 students compared to Higashiyama's 400.  At Kiyomi, the English department is much more open because it's just the one English teacher and me.  Both of us, together, make the team.  Higashiyama had of 4 (or 5) teachers, and I was mostly extra.  I was kept out of the loop constantly.  As such, whenever we get some city-wide fax about English, at Higashiyama I never knew about it, or anything that was going on.  At Kiyomi, everything is widely available to me, and I can take a look at it, and try to understand what's going on.</p><p>For the speech contest, I knew the information was coming down the pipeline, so I was waiting for it.  We finally got the information on April 7th, and the English teacher just gave it to me to look over.  I didn't realize this before, but the participation in the speech contest is limited based on the attendance at that particular Junior High school.  Higashiyama's 400 students allows them to enter 12 students in the contest.  Kiyomi's much smaller attendance only allows 4.</p><p>But, being at a smaller school has great advantages.  I know every student in the school, and have read all of their writing assignments.  I know about the things they like, and are passionate about.  And I know their level of English, too.  I immediately knew which students I wanted to participate in this contest.  Rather than post a notice in the classroom for everyone to ignore, I asked these students directly.  I had 8 students in mind, and asked them whether or not they were able to attend.  By the next week, I told them I wanted 4 of them to enter the contest.</p><p>By the next Friday, April 18th, I had my 4 participates.  I wasn't able to get 2 of my ideal students because they were too busy with club activities.  For my 4 students, I got them a copy of the contest information and rules, a copy of the entry form, and asked them to write me a speech in Japanese by the next Friday (4/25).  </p><p>Also, the submission deadline was Friday May 9th.  For this contest, only the entry form was required.  We were not required to submit the speech itself.</p><div class='title'><b>Translation</b></div><p>The 25th came pretty quickly, and I received written speeches from all the students. :)  It's so nice when students actually listen and do what you ask of them.  It totally makes sense that the better English sparkers in the school are very studious, as well.  That weekend, I went through the process of translating the speeches.</p><p>Yes, I think the students probably should have tried to write the English speeches themselves, but it's very difficult to proofread and correct an English assignment when I'm not entirely sure of the meaning behind it.  I wanted a complete speech written in Japanese, so I could fully understand what they were trying to say.  I think for the next contest, I will have the students try to write the English version, in addition to the Japanese.</p><p>Translating the speeches was not as difficult as I thought it would be.  They were all handwritten, so I had to decipher the Kanji with a dictionary anyways.  As I did so, I made a running vocabulary list of the Kanji, its reading, and its meaning.  I actually knew most of the grammar in the speech, too, so after plugging in the vocabulary, I had the meaning and could write an English sentence.  Also, after I had the Japanese text typed in Word, I dumped it into Google Translate so I had an extra translation to compare with.  It wasn't usable on its own, but certainly helped catching mistakes I made.</p><p>On Monday, I had the 4 speeches translated, and gave print-outs to the English teacher for a final proofread and translation check.</p><p>I should note that at this point, the English was a <b>direct translation</b> of the Japanese.  It was not meant to be the finished speech for the students.  I wanted to establish the meaning, so I could write an actual English speech from it.</p><div class='title'><b>Results</b></div><p>2 of the speeches were pretty good, and 2 of the speeches were not so good.</p><p>One of the speeches was great!  It had a lot of emotion and impact.  It was about an elementary school girl was run over by a car a few months ago.  The other good speech was about club activities at school, but it told a very nice story of problems she had, and how she overcame them.  Good speech material.</p><p>The other 2 were a little short.  One speech, about greetings, didn't really have any resolution to the conflict introduced at the beginning of the speech.  The rest of the speech was alright, so I had the student write an addition paragraph to complete the conflict.</p><p>The other one was about how living in such a small town creates social roles for everyone, and that you can't break out of them.  It seemed really interesting to me, but it didn't have a story, or a purpose, or any general aim.  It just seemed like information, but even then, it wasn't presented very well.  The English teacher even mentioned that he wasn't able to understand it by reading the Japanese.</p><p>We asked her to fix it, and she just wrote a completely new speech.  This one was about club activities.  It had a similar theme to the other student's club activity speech, but it had its own voice, and was good enough.  It could have used a little more conflict, or some kind of revolution made by the speaker, but it was complete as is.</p><div class='title'><b>Writing</b></div><p>With the translations complete, writing the 4 speeches wasn't too difficult.  I think the biggest problem with translating and writing the speeches myself is that they tend to be written in my voice, rather than the students.  </p><p>I don't really consider myself a writer, but I have been writing about random things for quite a while now.  Very early on, I made the decision to simply write exactly how I talked.  When I read someone's work, if they write how they talk, I never feel like I'm fighting the text to understand.  I understand the ideas naturally as if they actually were explaining it to me, rather than burying the meaning in pose or other literary nonsense.</p><p>Because I'm not a writer, this is how I write, and it's difficult to avoid that when writing a speech for someone else.  I think this is the second best reason to make the students write their own speeches.  (The first reason being practice.)  But, having their full Japanese text can help me identify a voice, and try to include that when writing.</p><p>In some of the speeches, I was able to identify some repetition, and uniqueness that I thought was a voice of theirs.  So, I was sure to include that rhythm into their English speech.</p><div class='title'><b>Example</b></div><p>For example, there's the following line in one of the speeches:</p><p><span class='ja'>練習の時でも、試合の時でも、何も言わなくても、今まで一緒にいた仲間だから気持ちは通じていると私達は思っていたので、お互いに声をかけ合わなかったのです。</span></p><p>I thought the repetition of <span class='ja'>でも</span>, <span class='ja'>でも</span>, <span class='ja'>ても</span> was a clear conscious writing decision.  Later in the speech, there were two other sentences that repeated 3 times to emphasis what they were trying to say.</p><p>For the above sentence, I had this translation:</p><p><i>Even when we practice.  Even when we play a game.  Even when we don’t say anything.  Up until now, because we were such close friends, we thought we could truly understand each other’s feelings without having to say anything.</i></p><p>So, when I finally wrote this into the speech, it was the following:</p><p><i>Up until now, because we were such close friends, whenever we practiced, whenever we played a game, whenever we didn’t say anything, I thought we truly understood each other’s feelings.</i></p><p>I tired to keep that same flow.</p><div class='title'><b>Preparation Materials</b></div><p>By Friday May 2nd, I had the speeches written, and I had each student read through the speech once on their own.  As they read, I circled any words or contents they had trouble saying or pronouncing correctly.  I tried not to use too many big words, but there were some instances where I should've dumbed it down more.</p><p>For each students, I now had a list of words and trouble areas I could focus on.  Over that weekend, I made CDs for the students to practice with.  The first track was of me simply reading through the speech.  I read at a pace that I felt was equal to the student's.  For the second track, I read a sentence, then left a pause of equal length.  This way the student's could repeat after the CD.  The third track focused on these problem areas.  I made a vocabulary sheet of each difficult word, and then sentence it was used in.  I read the word 3 times with a pause for the student to repeat.  Then I read the sentence 3 times with pauses.</p><p>By the next week, I had the following things for each student:  1 written speech, 1 vocabulary sheet, and 1 CD.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7506.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7506.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7506.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7509.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7509.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_7509.webp" /></p><div class='title'><b>Practice</b></div><p>Now the students could practice on their own, and have an English example to emulate.  In addition, starting on May 9th, before school, and during the lunch recess, I scheduled times for each students to meet with me, and meet with the English teacher to perform and practice their speeches in person.  </p><p>I didn't make this known to the student, but I had the following checklist, or flowchart, or whatever when teaching the students how to perform their speech.</p><p>1. Pronunciation<br/>2. Rhythm<br/>3. Memorizing<br/>4. Gestures / Attitude / Performance</p><p>First, I focused a lot on the pronunciation of their speech.  I made sure their Rs, Ls, THs, etc sounded good.  As well as other difficult words.  Most of this is covered on the CD for the students to practice at home.  When I'm actually practicing with the student in person, the student can watch my mouth to see how to make the correct sounds.</p><p>Once they had great pronunciation, I moved to the next item: rhythm.  There's a lot of ups and downs, and short pauses when saying sentences in English.  There's plenty of words that are combined when speaking, too.  One student's speeches had "in an instant" which is slurred when spoken.</p><p>After they had the pronunciation, rhythm and flow of the speech down, they had to memorize it.  I'm not sure how much the students practiced the speeches on their own, but only one of the students actually memorized their speech.  And even they weren't 100% perfect, and still needed a few cues.  Again, I referred them to the CD.  They could try to recite their speech by listening to the CD and repeat without looking at their speech's script.</p><p>The last step "gestures, attitude, and performance" is really what makes the speech.  It's what elevates the contents of the speech into something interesting and memorable.  Everything else is extremely important, but those are all building blocks to what wins the competition.</p><p>Unfortunately, I didn't make it to this step.  The English teacher was very busy planning the 3<span class='ja'>年生</span> school trip, and managing the school's baseball team, that he rarely made it to any of the scheduled times.  So, the times were all double booked, and I wasn't able to dedicate the time needed to each student.</p><p>To improve this process, I think I should make this known to the students.  Also, I need to schedule a strict deadline of when they need to memorize their speech.  Gestures, and attitude can be taught along the way, but I don't want to overwhelm them with all the steps at once.  Once they memorize the speech, I think that's when they can remember that kind of advice and actually use it.</p><p>I practiced with the students for the next 3 weeks.  On the last day before the contest, the English teacher had them perform their speeches in class.  The students were super nervous, but I think it was really good for them.  It was the first time they actually performed to an audience.  We should've done this much earlier, and more often.</p><div class='title'><b>Competition</b></div><p>May 31st finally arrived.  The doors of the competition opened at 9am, and all the students began to arrive.  This year, we only had 51 students in the contest.  (Last year was 81.)  There were no 1<span class='ja'>年生</span> students for some reason.</p><p>My students were really nervous, but they arrived, and had a good attitude.  I think some of them hated it, but they still faced the challenge, and performed their speeches when they were called on.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8592.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8592.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8592.webp" /></p><p>At the end of the competition, the top 5 students were given awards.  None of my students made the top 5, but that's perfectly fine.  I think it was an accomplishment for them to have entered and performed their speeches in the first place.  It's not the first time any of them had to read in front of an audience.  But it was the first time they wrote, rehearsed, and performed their own material to a large crowd.  They were quite nervous, but they overcame their fears for those brief minutes.</p><p>Hopefully some of them will get the opportunity to study abroad. :)  I think that would be an amazing experience for them.</p><div class='title'><b>Display</b></div><p>With the competition over and behind them, I printed a bunch of photos and gave them to the students as a present.</p><p>Additionally, I created a sheet for each of the students that included their English speech and some photos.  I printed each one, and posted it outside the English room for all the students in the school to view.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8865.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8865.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140531_speech/IMG_8865.webp" /></p><p>Hopefully this will motivate more students to want to do the contest.</p><div class='title'><b>Update! (June 14th)</b></div><p>Apparently, all 4 of my students did well enough to be selected for studying abroad to Australia this summer!  Nice!  I hope that take advantage of the opportunity and see more of this world. :)<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 6, 2014<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 3, 2014</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">History of Kiyomi Public Schools (Part 1)</h3><p>I teach at 4 different schools, and the main schools that I teach at are in the village of <b>Kiyomi</b>, which is part of Takayama city.  Today, Kiyomi has 1 junior high school, and 1 elementary, but it used to have a whole lot more.</p><p>Last year, Kiyomi Junior High School celebrated its 50th year.  And this year, Kiyomi Elementary celebrates its 40th.  When both schools were opened, it was the consolidation of all the education in Kiyomi into a single building.</p><p>Back when I first started at Kiyomi, I spent a few days in the Library, and looked through books in their "local" section.  I found a book published by the City Council of Kiyomi that was basically the almanac of the village.  It details Kiyomi's agriculture, industry, demographics, and history.  There was a section of the book titled <span class='ja'>わたしの学校</span> (or "My School") which I found quite fascinated.  It had a timeline of all the schools that ever existed in Kiyomi village.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7711_t.webp" /></a></p><p>So, I present to you: The History of Kiyomi Schools.</p><p><i>Much of the general historical information was taken from Wikipedia.</i></p><div class='title'><b>Meiji Period</b></div><p>The earliest schools in Kiyomi date all the way back near the beginning of the Meiji period.  <span class='ja'>明治</span>6, 7, and 8 marked the beginning of Kiyomi's 6 major schools.  That's 1873, 1874, and 1875.</p><p>The Meiji period marked the beginning of Japan's restoration to bring themselves out of their feudal society and into the modern world that was way more advanced than they were.  Education was one of the biggest concerns in the country.  In 1871, the Ministry of Education was established with a school system closely based on the United States.  They created elementary, middle, normal, and university school systems.</p><p>Elementary schools taught primary education are were meant to create loyal subjects to the Emperor of Japan.  Middle schools were secondary education, and were basically the equivalent of a High School.  They were to prepare students to enter Universities, and the Universities were to create students into leaders and modernize Japan.  Normal schools were training schools for graduates of middle schools who wanted to become teachers. </p><p>By 1900, Enrollment in public schools was 90%, whereas the start of the Meiji era only had 50%.<br/><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>At this time, the 6 schools in Kiyomi were:</p><p><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>まきがほら</span> / Makigahora<br/><span class='ja'>福奇尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>ふくより</span> / Fukuyori<br/><span class='ja'>巣野俣尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>すのまた</span> / Sunomata<br/><span class='ja'>夏厩尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>なつうまや</span> / Natsuumaya<br/><span class='ja'>池本尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>いけもと</span> / Ikemoto<br/><span class='ja'>大原尋常小学校</span> / <span class='ja'>おっぱら</span> / Oppara</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>Kiyomi had 2 branch schools, too:</p><p><span class='ja'>森茂分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>もりも</span> / Morimo<br/><span class='ja'>楢谷分教場</span> / <span class='ja'>ならだに</span> / Naradani</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Each school (and branch school) is named after the neighborhood it resides it.</p><p>The official declaration of a school was <span class='ja'>尋常小学校</span>.  <span class='ja'>尋常</span> or <span class='ja'>じんじょう</span> translates as public, or common.  <span class='ja'>小学校</span> (<span class='ja'>しょうがっこ</span>) is elementary school.  Branch schools were <span class='ja'>分教場</span> (<span class='ja'>ぶんきょうじょう</span>).</p><p>Higher education became increasingly important as Japan continued to industrialize.  In 1904, in Kiyomi, Makigahora, Fukuyori, and Natsuumaya all changed their designation to <span class='ja'>尋常高等小学校</span> adding the <span class='ja'>高等</span> into their names.  <span class='ja'>高等</span>, or <span class='ja'>こうとう</span>, stands for "high class."  It's also the same word used for Senior High School <span class='ja'>高等学校</span>.</p><p>In 1907, elementary school attendance was made mandatory.  From now on, all children in Japan were required to have 6 years of primary education.  Middle schools were only required for students who wanted to go to a university, or normal school.</p><div class='title'><b>Taisho Period</b></div><p>In 1912, Emperor Meiji passed away, and Taisho became the new emperor.  The educational system became even more centralized, but there were plenty of good things that happened.  The Extraordinary Council on Education was created in 1917 and set forth many reforms.  Many more private colleges were now officially recognized.  Subsidies were introduced for poor families so their children could attend schools.</p><p>Education started to become much more militaristic, too.  And Japan started using a lot of educational ideas from Germany to instill the ideas of nationalism, patriotism, and militarization.</p><div class='title'><b>Showa Period</b></div><p>Nationalism and Militarization continued as Japan entered World War II.  In 1941, the educational system renamed all of its schools to <span class='ja'>国民学校</span> (<span class='ja'>こくみんがっこ</span>), which means National People's Schools.  This is taken from the German language.  Nation People's School translates as Volksschule, which is interesting, too.  Schule is School in German.  Volks stands for "people of", "national", etc.  The name Volkswagen makes a lot of sense now.</p><p>The elementary schools now required mandatory military training.  The principles of education now taught traditional, political, religious, and moral values.  Every day was to serve the Empire of Japan.  Every school in Japan turned into a cult of worship building loyal soldiers to die for their country.</p><div class='title'><b>Post-War</b></div><p>In 1945, Japan surrendered to the United States, and the educational system of Japan had collapsed.  As the United States occupied Japan and rebuilt it, there were several specific missions sent to rebuild the educational system.</p><p>One of these new reforms was to recreate the division between the levels of schooling to resemble the US.</p><p>Before now, elementary education was 6 years, secondary education was 3 years, and higher education (university) was 4 years.  Only elementary schools were mandatory.  The reforms now created two tiers of secondary education: lower and upper, and made lower secondary education mandatory for all students.</p><p>This created the following:</p><p><span class='ja'>小学校</span> - Elementary Schools - Elementary education for 6 years.  (required)<br/><span class='ja'>中学校</span> - Junior High Schools - Lower Secondary education for 3 years. (required)<br/><span class='ja'>高等学校</span> - Senior High Schools - Upper Secondary education for 3 years.<br/><span class='ja'>大学校</span> - University - Higher education for 4 years</p><p>The year <span class='ja'>昭和</span>22, or 1947, was the first year to follow the new law.  This is the system that Japan follows today.  Even though Senior High Schools are not required, 94% of junior high school graduates apply and enter high school.  And more than 95% of students graduate.  (As of 2005)</p><p><div class="title">Kiyomi Village</div><div class="columns"><div class="column"><p>In 1947, the 6 major schools turned into the following:</p><p><span class='ja'>牧ケ洞中小学校</span> / Makigahora JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>福奇中小学校</span> / Fukuyori JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>巣野俣中小学校</span> / Sunomata JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>夏厩中小学校</span> / Natsuumaya JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>池本中小学校</span> / Ikemoto JHS+ES<br/><span class='ja'>大原中小学校</span> / Oppara JHS+ES</p></div><div class="column twoColumnLast"><p>And there were now 4 branch schools</p><p> <span class='ja'>池本中小森茂分校</span> / Ikemoto JHS+ES (Morimo Branch)<br/><span class='ja'>上小島分校</span> / Kami Odori Branch School<br/><span class='ja'>小島山分校</span> / Odori Mountain Branch School<br/><span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span> / Naradani Branch School</p></div><br/></div><br class="clr"></p><p>Even though, the grades were separated, the Junior High and elementary schools still operated in the same building.</p><p>I found a book in my local library that listed the attendance for each of these schools starting in <span class='ja'>昭和</span>30, or 1955.  Combining the attendance at each school, there were 373 junior high school students, and 750 elementary students in that year.</p><p>The population of Kiyomi was decreasing, and the world was getting smaller with advancements in automobiles, and other forms of travel.</p><p>With the junior high school system in place, all schools across Japan began making separate buildings for junior high students only.  In 1962, construction began for a single building in all of Kiyomi that would unite the junior high students under one roof.</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> / Kiyomi Junior High School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_7723.webp" /></p><p>In <span class='ja'>昭和</span>38, or 1963, Kiyomi Junior High School <span class='ja'>清見中学校</span> opened for its first school year, and all the junior high school students in Kiyomi village now attended this school.  Both Morimo Branch School <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>, and Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> still served some junior high students, but only in the winter when traveling to Kiyomi JHS was too difficult.  For Junior High, both schools operat as branch schools of Kiyomi JHS, whereas for elementary, they operated as branch schools of the nearby elementaries.</p><p>Also, Kiyomi JHS had an attached dormitory.  During the winter months, and throughout the year, students would be able to live at the school rather than make the journey home.</p><p>In its first year, the graduating class of Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> was 126 students, which were split between 3 classes at school.  The Junior High had an attached dormitory, so students from the distant areas of Kiyomi lived at school for the whole week before returning home for the weekend.</p><p>I think it became a real point of pride for Kiyomi when the junior high school opened.  For the first time in its history, all the village's students attended the same school, and had classes together.  It really brought everyone together, and became a symbol for the community of Kiyomi.</p><div class='title'><b>Consolidation</b></div><p>A few years after Kiyomi JHS opened, the lingering branch schools began closing and filtering their students into the junior high school, and existing official nearby elementary schools.  Though, this was also more likely because the more remote regions of Kiyomi were no longer self-sustaining, and people were moving into the more populated areas.</p><p>The Sunomata ES <span class='ja'>巣野俣小</span> building closed in 1965, and all their students now went to Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span>.  And with the closure of Sunomata, the Naradani Branch School <span class='ja'>楢谷分校</span> closed, too.  Any students in Naradani probably just went to Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span>.</p><p>The Kami Odori Branch School <span class='ja'>上小鳥分校</span> changed it's name to Winter Branch School <span class='ja'>冬期分校</span> in 1965.  <span class='ja'>冬期</span> or <span class='ja'>とうき</span> is Japanese for Winter Term, so I'm guessing this school was only used in the winter to relieve the students of the dangerous daily journey to school.  It stayed open for another 3 years, and closed for good in 1968.</p><p>Also, in 1968, the Odori Mountain Branch School <span class='ja'>小鳥山分校</span> of Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span> closed.</p><p>Kiyomi now had 5 operating elementary schools, and one distant branch school (Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span>).  Until…</p><div class='title'><b><span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> / Kiyomi Elementary School</b></div><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8473.webp" /></p><p>In 1974, or <span class='ja'>昭和</span>49, as the population of Kiyomi continued to decrease by the younger generation moving away to more prosperous areas of Takayama, construction of Kiyomi Elementary School <span class='ja'>清見小学校</span> was complete.  Makigahora ES <span class='ja'>牧ケ洞小</span>, Fukuyori ES <span class='ja'>福寄小</span> both closed and their students now attended Kiyomi ES.  Natsuumaya ES <span class='ja'>夏厩小</span> closed as well, and those students filtered into Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>.</p><p>The two most distant schools, Oppara ES <span class='ja'>大原小</span> and Ikemoto ES <span class='ja'>池本小</span>, continued to operate after Kiyomi ES was open.</p><p>The Morimo Branch <span class='ja'>森茂分校</span> finally closed, too, on the eve of Kiyomi ES's opening.  I think the final remaining residents of that neighborhood finally moved closer in Kiyomi, or another neighboring area.  Which left Morimo completely uninhabited.</p><p>10 years later, in 1984, Ikemoto ES closed its doors, and its students went to Kiyomi ES.  And then, finally, in 2003, Opara ES closed, too.  </p><div class='title'><b>Today</b></div><p>And that brings us to today.  Since then, Kiyomi village has only two schools, Kiyomi JHS <span class='ja'>清見中</span> and Kiyomi ES <span class='ja'>清見小</span>.  Both of which all students in Kiyomi attend.</p><p>It's really hard to believe that Kiyomi JHS could actually hold 126 students in each class.  Today, each class has 23 to 27 students.  The population decline in Japan is very real, and it's very apparent when you start viewing the historical records in the schools.  Each year, graduating classes get a little bit smaller, and a little bit smaller.  Then those schools are closed, and students are filtered into the larger nearby schools.</p><p>At Kiyomi elementary, there are photos of the 10 schools mentioned above in the main entrance of the school.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_kiyomi/IMG_8496_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>From top to bottom, left to right, we have:</p><p>Ikemoto <span class='ja'>池本</span>, Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, Odori Mountain <span class='ja'>小鳥山</span>, Natsuumaya <span class='ja'>夏厩</span>, Kami Odori <span class='ja'>上小鳥</span><br/>Makigahora <span class='ja'>牧ケ洞</span>, Fukuyori <span class='ja'>福寄</span>, Sunomata <span class='ja'>巣野俣</span>, Oppara <span class='ja'>大原</span>, Naradani <span class='ja'>楢谷</span></p><p>Even though the schools were closed, some the building were reused and repurposed by the government.

It's not too difficult to locate using Google Maps.  If you search for the neighborhood, Maps will give you a delightful outline: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d" title="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kiyomicho+Morimo/@36.1695978,136.9798248,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x600282aac5c1e7d3:0x932eecd930b96a6d">here</a>.  Looking on the map, there's only two ways to get to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>: come from the east, or come from the south.  My first attempt was coming from the east in which I ran into possible trouble.  Today's attempt was coming from the South, and going through the village of Shokawa <span class='ja'>荘川</span>.</p><p>If you follow the highway's frontage road south from the Hida Kiyomi entrance, about 15 minutes later, you'll come across a small farming neighborhood that has a road leading into the wilderness.  This road continues to follow a stream as it approaches Miboro Lake <span class='ja'>御母衣湖</span>,  Actually, right as that streams connects with the lake, you've arrived in the very southern tip of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.</p><p>Today, I drove to this neighborhood, and took the road into the forest.  After 10 minutes of driving, the pavement ends and turns into a rocky "dirt" road.  Still traversable, but at a much slower rate.  </p><p>As I continued through the forest, I actually came across some kind of neighborhood.  A house on stilts stood near this turn-off.  Looking at the map (36.081985, 137.002227), the road trails off but rejoined the main road not that much further, so it seemed like a "great" idea.  So, I decided to drive through this neighborhood.</p><p>The roads were actually paved, but were also totally covered by dried leafs, pine needles, some fallen branches, some fallen rocks, and some fallen trees.  Several times, I exited my car to clear the road for my car.  </p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8655.webp" /></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8662.webp" /></p><p>I found 4 houses packed within this neighborhood.  Each house was on stilts, built in the middle of the forest.  There were no cars around, so I couldn't tell if anyone actually lived in them.  I would guess not.  At least not anyone of our society.  Bums or squatters could have been inside, but there's no way they could live without assistance from the outside world.  There were no gardens, or any livelihood at all.  Just an old house.</p><p>I did not pry.</p><p>However, Google Maps lied, and the roads that were certain to bring me back to the main road did not exist.  I turned my car around, and went back the way I came.</p><p>With that done, I continued on my way to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>, and met my first obstruction: a big red gate.  The gates were at this point: 36.101633, 137.001209.  From the main road, these gates were about 23 minutes in.  Some other cars were already parked there, and an ashed fire pit was next to the white van.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8698.webp" /></p><p>Past the gate was something I was very curious about.  On Google Maps, at point: 36.114263, 136.997079, the road is cut off as it hits a connecting stream.  On the other side of the stream, Maps marks a "walking only" road, which continues onward to Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span>.  There's gotta be a bridge there, I thought.  Or some easy way to get across.</p><p>However, if the bridge was out, and I could walk across, Google Maps says it's about a 12 kilometer walk to where I considered a downtown area of Morimo.  Maps says that's a 2 hr 42 min hike, one way.  From my current position, I'm walking anyway.  But now there's an addition 2 kilometers to this possible bridge, which will add another 20-25 minutes.</p><p>Even though I needed to walk, I was still curious about the bridge, and walking that distance doesn't bother me.  So, I parked my car, grabbed my camera, ID, and water bottle, moved around the gate, and continued to walk down the road.  After 27 minutes, I reached that point on the map (36.114263, 136.997079), and HOLY SHIT!  The bridge actually exists!  Ha ha ha, I knew it.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8726.webp" /></p><p>But now I had a decision to make.  It's about 3:40pm.  I figured I could cover the 12k in about 2 hours at most, since it's a little more than half a half marathon length (23.1km).  That would get me back to my car around 8pm, I think, which is past sunset, and an absolutely bad idea.</p><p>I dunno… I couldn't simply stop, though.  So, I stupidly decided to continue.  I'll give myself until 5pm, then turn around.  Well, I didn't even last until 4pm when I came across an immovable barrier at point (36.119619, 136.988925), and immediately turned around.</p><p>As I turned the corner at that point, there was <b>a brown bear</b> in the middle of the road.</p><p>When I saw it, I thought it was a giant hyena, or some kind of wild dog.  It was big, though.  I'd say it was as big as I am.  It was facing directly at me, and it clearly and immediately saw me the instant I saw it.  My footsteps were making enough noise that it probably heard me coming.  I immediately recognized this situation as DANGER.  Without even thinking, I did a 180, and walked back the direction I came.  This all happened within a second.  The creature came into view, my brain said NOPE, and I am now walking back to my car.</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/grandpa-simpson-arrives-and-leaves_49.webp" /></p><p>I walked with the same attitude I had before seeing it to make it think I wasn't afraid or something.  And I was surveying the ground for anything I could use as a possible weapon if thing started stalking after me.  Also, I was still trying to figure out what I had just seen, and the likelihood of whether or not it would come after me, and if I were actually capable of defending myself.  Which was doubtful.  If that thing started chasing and attacking me, I'd be beaten down pretty quickly.  </p><p>And then I started thinking of that girl who was attacked by a bear.  And while the bear was eating her alive, she called her mom crying and panically explained the situation as it happened.  This one: <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html" title="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2026914/Mum-bear-eating--Final-phone-calls-woman-19-eaten-alive-brown-bear-cubs.html">Daily Mail… sorry :(</a></p><p>After a few minutes of walking, and looking over my shoulder every couple of seconds, I figured it was far enough away, and that I could start running now.  I checked the time as well, so I could pinpoint this location later.  It was 3:56pm.</p><p>I made it back to Google's invisible bridge at 4:07pm.  Still no <b>bear</b> behind me.  And I made it back to my car at 4:28pm.  Still no bear.  Safe!</p><p>Again, I thought it was some kind of dog or hyena or something.  It had a long face, and body more like a dog or hyena.  Not a bear.  Or at least, the "bear" body image that always comes to mind.  Bears always seem so puffy.</p><p>Once at home, I started searching on Google to figure out what I had seen.  Apparently, Japanese wolves are extinct, and any wild dogs are no longer than 100cm (or 1 yard).  I searched for other wildlife in central Japan, and didn't find anything that fit the description in my head.  I searched for Japanese bears, and the following image is similar to the type of animal I saw:</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/brown_bear_outside.webp" /></p><p>(This image was taken from <a href="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387" title="http://digitaljournal.com/article/323387">digitaljournal.com</a>)</p><p>It's pretty close.  It's hard to trust my memory since I only saw the thing for an instant, and even though I turned around, my brain was constantly fixated on that brief visual encounter.  Any details could be slightly skewed.  I remember that it's face was dark, and it's body was brown, somewhat light brown.  Though, it could've been in the sun, which made it appear more light.  Again, it had a thin slender long face.</p><p>It's still really early in the year, so it's slender features make sense.  Bears don't get their full "puffy" figures until the end of the year.</p><p>According to some other articles, most bears shouldn't attack humans, but HELL NO, I'm not going to put that to the test.  As much as I would like to return to this path with a full day and a mountain bike, coming across another bear is way too damn risky.</p><p>Also, brown bears are on the list of endangered species.  So, even if I do encounter another bear, and if that bear attacks me, and if I'm able to defend myself, and kill it, I'll have to pay some enormous fine, and probably go to jail.  There are stories about that ALL the time despite being self defense.</p><p>I think my next attempt in the wilderness of Morimo <span class='ja'>森茂</span> will be under a more official capacity, and in a car.</p><p><br/>Anyway, the road to Morimo through Shokawa was quite beautiful. :)</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch.webp" ><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8703_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140601_morimo/IMG_8747.webp" /><br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 1, 2014<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">June 2014</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/searching-for-morimo">1</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/history-of-kiyomi-public-schools">3</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/takayama-speech-contest">6</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">8</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/tomodachi-life-fashion-catalog">16</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/takaoka-marathon-2">18</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/carwash-graveyard">23</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/oak-village">25</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
