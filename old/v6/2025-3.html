It first opened in 1964 and displays over 200 lifesize concrete soldiers recreating the atmosphere and intensity of the battle. Many of the major lords are present from the battle as well as several minor lords. </p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3620_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The park feels like a forgotten relic due to its age and general lack of upkeep or any form of modernization. The concrete figures are a huge mixed bag of quality, from the general inhuman facial details, varying degrees of skin tones (from dark brown to yellow to white to pink), and warped joints (possibly from a lack of precise molding equipment). In addition, many of the key figures of the battle whose appearance is pretty consistant across the other museums in town are very generic here.</p><p>Also, there are 60 year old coin machines at the entrance which no longer operate. There's a lecture hall whose doors barely opened. Inside the lecture hall, there's a diorama of the battle which doesn't seem like it works anymore. And the admission's desk was staffed by an apathetic old woman who seemed bothered and took her time selling me a ticket, and said nothing the whole time.</p><p>It really feels like a burnt out 80s theme park from the movies.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3637_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Many of the concrete figures have nameplates underneath them identifying who the statue is meant to represent. Unfortunately the education ends there. Warland doesn't offer any documentation on any of the figures in their park beyond a few posted signs. It's nice there is some identification but if you don't know who these people are, there's no immediate way of finding out.</p><p>Local people probably have a good idea. Also, maybe they offered some kind of tour guide for the park? There was certainly no guide when I visited on this Saturday afternoon.</p><div class='title'><b>Mori Clan <span class='ja'>毛利氏</span></b></div><p>After entering Warland, there were several named statues on the hillside to the right.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3533_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Ankokuji</b> Ekei <span class='ja'>安国寺恵瓊</span> was a military monk who was close with <b>Kobayakawa</b> Takakage, leader of the Kobayakawa clan and who would've been a member of the Five Regeants had he not died before Toyotomi in 1598. The Kobayakawa clan was a sub-faction of the Mori clan, and with Takakage's death, Ankokuji feared the Mori clan would be wiped out with the loss of a great leader. He was happy that <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span>succeeded in becoming a regeant giving them the strength to protect their survival, but this forced the Kobayakawa clan against Tokugawa as Mori supported Ishida.</p><p><b>Ankokuji</b> Ekei became one of the top commanders of the Mori army and commanded his own army of 1800 troops stationed further east from the battle, planning on attacking Tokugawa's rear. In front of him was <b>Kikkawa</b> Hiroie <span class='ja'>吉川広家</span>.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3527_t.webp" /></a></p><p>That's this guy. <b>Kikkawa</b> Hiroie was head of the Kikkawa clan, also a sub-faction of the Mori clan. It is said that through his diplomacy and politics he was able to keep the peace between the sub-factions of the Mori clan after <b>Kobayakawa</b> Takakage's death. On the day of the Battle, as mentioned above, his army of 4200 was stationed in front of Ankokuji and the whole of the Mori army.</p><p>Mori's retainers supported Ishida and the other Toyotomi loyalists, but it was clear to Kikkawa that they would lose the battle. Kikkawa made a secret pact with <b>Kuroda</b> Nagamasa <span class='ja'>黒田長政</span> of the Tokugawa army that if he prevented the Mori armies from joining the battle, the Mori clan would be spared and be able to keep their domains. So, when the Mori clan gave Kikkawa the order to attack, he refused. And his refusal prevented the rest of the Mori clan from engaging in the battle.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3525_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This is Mori, by the way, but not <b>Mori</b> Terumoto <span class='ja'>毛利輝元</span>, who was one of the Five Regeants. This is his cousin <b>Mori</b> Hidemoto <span class='ja'>毛利秀元</span>. Terumoto never joined the battle and stayed in Osaka Castle. Hidemoto was determined to support Ishida of the Western Army and brought 15,000 soldiers of his army to the battle. But, because of Kikkawa's inaction, he was prevented from attacking.</p><p>After the battle, the whole secret pact fell apart because Mori never agreed to it. It was only Kikkawa who put forth the idea to Kuroda and Tokugawa. As such, the Mori clan lost 75% of its territories after Tokugawa became Shogun, and they labeled Kikkawa as a traitor. Ankokuji, still fiercely loyal to the Western Army, was executed in Kyoto with Ishida weeks after the battle.</p><div class='title'><b>Head Viewing Ceremony <span class='ja'>首実検</span><a id="head-viewing"></a></b></div><p>After the Battle finished and Tokugawa was the victor, he led the Head Viewing Ceremony.

He was known as one of the bravest generals in Ishida's army, so I'm not sure why they protrayed him as a goofball above. It is said that he was shot by Kuroda's gunman when they attacked, so maybe they modeled him after that moment.</p><p>Shima's body was never recovered after the battle, so we don't know if he immediately died of his gunshot wounds, or if he survived and lived a few more years in hiding.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3607_t.webp" /></a></p><p>This was the main station of Ishida's forces. Ishida was in back, and this guy in the front has a nameplate, but I have no idea who it is. The closest person I could find was <b>Ujiie</b> Yukihiro <span class='ja'>氏家行広</span>, who used the nickname Kyuuasemon <span class='ja'>久左衛門</span>. It's not perfect, but the kanji <span class='ja'>氏家久左衛門</span> is pretty close.</p><p>Ujiie planned on joining the Eastern Army with Tokugawa, but with his kingdom in the path of the Western Army, he returned to his home and his family joined with Ishida. According to Wikipedia, he never joined the battle, so this is further confirmation it's not the right person.</p><p>After the battle, the Ujiie clan was dissolved, and Yukihiro became a ronin.

However, according to Wikipedia, after studying Kuroda's personal records of the battle, scholars have Musashi's father as serving Tokugawa's army instead. Scholars claim that having Musashi fighting for the West was always a romanticized ideal of him being an amazing ronin warrior fighting for the heart of Japan, but facts do not point to this.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_warland/IMG_3677_t.webp" /></a></p><p><b>Kani</b> Saizo <span class='ja'>可児才蔵</span> was a commander in Fukushima's army.

As Ishida began raising his army against Tokugawa, Tokugawa grew seeds of betrayal with Hideaki. He claimed that Ishida was responsible for the embarassment he suffered for a defeat a few years prior. On the day of the Battle, Hideaki was still indecisive whether or not to go through with his betrayal.

In many ways, the main Battle of Sekigahara Museum is an evolution of this site, as it shows the build-up and progression of the battle using film and projectors. In comparison, Warland is a primitive way of showing almost the same thing.</p><p>However, it's still an incredible place. The Battle Museum does show the intensity of the battle, but when you're in the field of around 200 lifesize concrete soldiers, you can feel the scale and chaos of the battle. Being able to walk around and view the individual people involved, and (later) being able to look up who they were, humanizes the battle, too.</p><p>It's a shame that there isn't more education about all the named people in the park, but I think it's still definitely worth a visit.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on March 25, 2025<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">March 22, 2025</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Sengoku Armor Museum 戦国甲冑館</h3><p>The Sengoku Armor Museum in Sekigahara is a private collection of real samurai armor.

The owner of this collection only collects and restores original pieces from the Battle of Sekigahara and the Sengoku period in general. Several of the pieces were owned by major lords in the battle, but not necessrily worn in the battle itself. Many of the other pieces were worn by soldiers in the battle, some of which were killed.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3218_t.webp" /></a></p><p>The museum is just north of the main Battle of Sekigahara museum, and currently only takes reservations to view the collection.

There's also an attached shop with some exclusive Sekigahara merch, and a small restaurant where the family will cook an "authentic" samurai meal for you. They also have a pet duck. :)</p><p>I was only interested in the armor for this visit, but next time I think I'll go for the lectural experience.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3158_stitch_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Immediately to the right after reception were 9 sets of armor, mostly consisting of foot soldiers. I'm not sure if any of these were used in the Battle of Sekigahara. In fact, the emblem above the middle set of armor is of the Fujiwara clan, which never participated in the battle.</p><p>The Fujiwara clan rose to power in the 800s, but another 800 years later at the time of the Battle, I think the clan had mostly been divided and renamed into other factions and eventually bred out of existance. One of their military branches was renamed the Monnashi clan, which did participate in the battle within Tokugawa's Eastern Army.</p><p>The flags in the back have the Ishida emblem on them, and the front foot soldier helmets have <span class='ja'>石</span> ishi written on them, so maybe those are some of Ishida's men?

I think he mentioned that all of these armor belonged to members of the Tokugawa clan, which makes sense given the above emblem. <b>Tokugawa</b> Ieyasu <span class='ja'>徳川家康</span> was one of the members of the Five Regeants and the key agitator which led to the Battle of Sekigahara.</p><p>While TV shows and history sometimes paint him as a glorious unifier of Japan, he is incredibly cold, manipulative, and constantly schemes against his rivals. Immediately after Toyotomi's death, he began scheming a series of marriage pacts to increase his standing, something which was strictly forbidden by Toyotomi. He used other political schemes to blackmail other lords into fighting for him. Any opportunity to increase his standing or decrease the standing of another was immediately taken.</p><p>While it seemed like many people hated the outspoken, garish attitude of Ishida, they hated Tokugawa more. Ishida went to war with Tokugawa to preserve the ideals set forth by Toyotomi. Everyone loyal to the deceased unifier of Japan held their ground, but were ultimately overpowered by Tokugawa's influence and strength.</p><p>After the battle, everyone loyal to Toyotomi was either executed, exiled, or significantly diminished. With full control of the government, Tokugawa banned weapons, shut down the country, and put to death anyone who would continue to oppose him.</p><p>On one hand, he was a harsh dictator that people secretly hated and feared. On the other hand, his rule set Japan on a course of extreme prosperity the country had never seen before. The population exploded, literacy exploded, and culture exploded. Japan became a modern beacon of the world, which became quite popular in Europe.</p><p class='img'><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224.webp"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250322_sengoku_armor/IMG_3224_t.webp" /></a></p><p>Having better knowledge of the battle and those involved, next time I go back to the museum, I'll have a better idea of what to ask about the armor and be in a better place to take notes.</p><p>The museum itself is really small.

His troops stayed at Matsuoyama and did not engage in the battle until he finally made the decision to betray Ishida and attack Otani of the Western Army.

After the battle had been lost, they refused to retreat by showing their backs to the enemy.

I could not identify the middle armor, but armor on the left is of the Monnashi clan. The Monnashi clan was a military branch of what was left of the Fujiwara clan. The Fujiwara clan came to power around the 800s, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of information about it at the time of the Battle. There was no Monnashi army, and I think this was just a commander in the Tokugawa army.</p><p>There were a few other pieces there too, used by actors in the reenactment.</p><p>Overall, it was a fun surprise to see some of these after visiting the Sekigahara Battle Museum and Sengoku Armor museum.

With prime real estate on the platea of Kitayama, it gave an amazing view. But now, Kankou Hotel has been completely demolished and the site is nothing but a flat dirt area. COVID was perhaps the final nail in the coffin for the Kankou Hotel. It was probably already struggling from the competition of other newer hotels in Takayama. </p><p>Over the last 10 years, tourism in Takayama has exploded, and with the massive income, new hotels have been built in areas next to the station. Kankou Hotel was so far out of the way, nobody would realistically walk there from the station. They did have shuttle busses, but even then, if someone staying at the Kankou Hotel wanted to walk around Takayama, they'd have to go down the mountain and then go back up when returning. It's so much easier for people to just stay in a hotel at street level.</p><p>And then COVID happened and foreign tourism was completely halted. To make up some of the lost revenue, the Kankou Hotel used its rooms for people infected with COVID during the lockdown.
