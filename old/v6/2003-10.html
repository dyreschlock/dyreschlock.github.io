Crosby, a book assigned to be read by this Thursday for World Civilization II. But unlike most other history books required for reading, the one is actually quite interesting as it discusses the biological effects of what America was to what it is today.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>When the Europeans landed in America in 1492, the bridge between the two sides of the globe was formed and what the Europeans saw in America completely shocked them. They had never before seen an iguana, an alligator, a rattlesnake, a monkey that swung from branches with its tail, nor bison and buffalo. Before this time, horses, cattle, chickens, pigs, donkeys and such were exclusive only to the old world.</p><p>The biggest domesticated quadaped in the new world was the dog. Since the new world had never seen horses, or anything else before, the Native Americans were shocked and frightened to see such beasts being ridden by man. And when the settlers finally did attack and masacare the Native Americans, such fear felt by the Native Americans would be the same as if the planet Earth were attacked by an alien race of superior technology. It's as if our America as we live in today, is the result of an alien invasion over 500 years ago that completely raped and wiped out the previous life, settled, and grew with no regard for the previous inhabitants.</p><p>The book gives an example of Orson Well's War of the Worlds as being a close similarity to the fights. The settlers had superior defenses and offenses, superior weaponry, and the settlers also brought with them highly infectious viruses they already knew about, but the native Americans had never seen before in their lives. I think we know how that went.</p><p>Back when the settlers returned to America, they brought with them horses, cattle, swine, and so forth. The land was so vast and "untouched" that it was perfect for these animals, who in America had no real predator, to roam free and multiply at unheard numbers. Some ranches that lost 30-40 of their cattle, would later find the cattle in pastures had multiplied to about 400 in only a matter of a few decades.</p><p>Passing by ships through the tropic islands between North and South America would simply drop off a few dozens pigs on some of the islands, then return in a few decade to their heards' exponential growth. Who knows how much plantlife had gone extinct at this time, when these animals devoured every plant that was edible.</p><p>So many of the animals brought over to the Americas escaped free to nature. Cats and goats, as well. Later on in the 19th century, Charles Darwin toured the Americas and saw that the more docile and domesticated species in Europe were now furociously transformed and deadly to survive and live on their own for the past 300 years in the Americas. How the sweet cute cat when found later in the mountains of South America had grown in overall size, bore greater fangs, and hunted its prey more stealthlike. How the very docile goat in the mountains grew larger horns, and attacked trespassers.</p><p>This brought about more discussion of evolution and survival, ontop of the already conversial and debated theories of where all the species of Native America could have come from. Like, if Noah had 2 of every animal on his ark, which was in Jeruselum, how did all these unheard of species exist on the other side of the world, if they had no way to get there, and God flooded the entire earth? Many debates were constructed about the bering land bridge, or that the flood didn't flood as far as America.</p><p>------------------------------------------------</p><p>Anyways, I'm over halfway through the book, but the author retells the details over and over again. The repetition is a little annoying, but it helps for memorization and emphasis.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 13, 2003<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 12, 2003</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Dance Dance Revolution Extreme</h3><p>It seems that, a month ago, I read the story on Impress Game Watch incorrectly.. The news story wasn't necessarily about the release of Dance Dance Revolution Extreme. It was a news story on a DDR "rave" event similar to the Beatmania "rave" event from a few years ago.</p><p>This DDR "rave" was pushed back to October 18th in Velfarre, Japan? Not the Japanese release of DDRextreme. So, actually this past Thursday, October 9th, DDRextreme was released. Hurrah! ^_^ And in addition to the initial releasings of DDRextreme, it included the DDRextreme Premium Disc, which is a soundtrack to DDRextreme. ^_^ Whoo hoo.. Free stuff. Free GOOD stuff. Unfortunately, this game was sent to my home in Minnesota, so it'll end up being an extra couple of days before I get it down in Platteville. Sigh... hopefully I'll get it before next weekend.</p><p>As for song information, DDRexteme has about 105 songs, which is more than any previous home version to date.

As well as a couple other challenging songs like Sakura, Vanity Angel, Xenon, Bag, and Cartoon Heroes new in DDR.</p><p>Though, it has the most songs in any home version to date, it can't contain everything that was in the arcade version of DDR extreme. The arcade machine contained every arcade DDR song to date. Many songs of which had new Oni steps that made the old songs with outdated stoic steps, have quicker and challenging steps. There also aren't the Oni only Max2 tracks featured in Max2 JP.</p><p>BUT HEY, can't have everything. ^_^ Unless I were to have the arcade board, or make Step Step Revolution or Dance with Intensity work on my computer, and then make the PS USB controller adapters work.</p><p>Anyways, this song list looks great. It's much better than DDR Max2 USA in my opinion. DDR Max2 USA kinda brings down the difficulty bar below DDR Max, where DDR Extreme had already brought the bar up higher before DDR Max2 USA was out.</p><p>And in other import gaming news, Gran Turimso Prologue is now available for reserve off ncsx.com, though I really don't think it'd be such a good idea to buy. Sure, it's Gran Turismo 4, which kicks ass. But, it's only one track, 3 modes of play, and a couple cars for $35. When the full version will probably be $80 and have well over 100 times the amount of stuff to do. I just gotta wait. ^_^ GT4 Prologue is too little. I can wait a few more months for the profound glory of GT4 JP. ^_^<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 12, 2003<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 8, 2003</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Fermat's Last Theorem</h3><p>Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) is probably the greatest amateur mathematician. He thought of mathematics much like a hobby. Early on in his career, he came to possess a copy of Diophantus' The Arithmetica. In his copy, he would scribble notes here and there in the margin. These were notes about theorems and then claims of his own. Every little claim that he made in this book was later proven to be true. (with the exception of his formula for prime numbers.)</p><p>Everything was proven except for one: Fermat's Last Theorem.</p><p><i>cubum autem in duos cubos, aut quadratoquadratum in duos quadratoquadratos, et generaliter nullam in infinitum ultra quadratum potestatem in duos ejusdem nominis fas est diviere: cujus rei demonstrationem mirabilem sane detexi. Hanc marginis exiguitas non capert.</i></p><p>(It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers, or in general, any power higher than the second into two like powers. I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.)</p><p>If n>2, then a^n+b^n=c^n has no solutions in nonzero integers a, b, and c. This one proof hung around well after fermat's death in 1665 and was finally proven a little over ten years ago, on June 23, 1993 by Andrew Wiles of Princeton and Cambridge.</p><p>The story of Andrew Wiles is somewhat interesting. That's what we learned today in math history ^_^ . Throughout the course of the last 300 years of mathematicians attempting to solve the equation, no one ever got close at all. The most interesting thing about attempting to prove Fermat's Last Theorem was the mathematics that came out of it in order to prove it, like the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for example, which stated that elliptic curves were modular. This was the key to proving Fermat's Last Theorem. Willes went to prove Fermat through Taniyama-Shimura, then Taniyama-Shimura through Frey curves, then Frey curves through Galios representations... blah blah blah. I don't know the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021210035334/http://www.mbay.net/~cgd/flt/flt08.htm" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20021210035334/http://www.mbay.net/~cgd/flt/flt08.htm">specifics</a>.</p><p>All of these mathematics were created, more or less, just to prove Fermat. Which raises the question: what the hell proof did Fermat have if mathematics of today had to change and grow in order to prove it. Crazy! Most people say he couldn't, and that he made it up. Even so, look at all of that Fermat inspired in mathematics. Or, maybe he didn't make it up and this guy proved <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030406145541/http://www.coolissues.com/mathematics/Fermat/fermat.htm" title="https://web.archive.org/web/20030406145541/http://www.coolissues.com/mathematics/Fermat/fermat.htm">that</a>.</p><p>Anywho, that was today's very interesting lesson in math history. Tomorrow's colloquium is hosted by Jeske, who is going to talk about Pick's theorem.</p><p>Hopefully someday I'll fulfill that childhood dream of making a theorem of my own. Schlock's theorem of Geometric Explanation? Who knows.. Maybe i could just be like Fermat and 'make up' a whole bunch of crap and let everyone else prove it. Hell, that's how Frey curves came about. Interesting, no? Schlock curves.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 8, 2003<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 8, 2003</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Cardano's Solution</h3><p>This is a term paper I wrote for my Math History class in college, which was an optional course offered once every 2 or 3 years.  I felt lucky to take it, and it was very interesting going through the building blocks of modern day mathematics from a "math class" point of view, rather than the point of view of a "history class".</p><p>The paper answers the question, "Is Cardano's Solution a great theorem?"</p><p><i>Original Post</i>: And now for your reading pleasure: my math history paper that is due in 15 minutes:</p><div class='title'><b>Cardano's Solution, a Great Theorem</b></div><p>Is Cardano's 'solution of the cubic' a Great Theorem?  Cardano's solution to the cubic took great algebraic insight.  In the book, <i>Journey Through Genius</i>, William Dunham includes Cardano's proof, along with eleven other proofs as the greatest mathematical achievements of all time.  Each chapter in his books exhibits rigorous proofs of our modern notational methods of proving, but for the original mathematicians to prove these theorems, there was no notation.  Original proofs had geometry and just words to illustrate the methods of finding such answers.</p><p>So what makes a Great Theorem great?  Something that all the great theorems in Journey Through Genius clearly illustrate is mathematical genius not seen in their time.  Some of these mathematicians were so immersed in the problems, that it was a matter of time before they found the answer.  Others solved these problems because their process of thought saw the problem differently than everyone else.  Euclid's proof of the 'infinitude of primes' showed his concept of infinity, before anyone decided to conceptualize the name.</p><p>Archimedes' 'determination of circular area' showed his concept of infinity and limits well before their time.  Heron's 'area of triangular space' provided a drastically different approach to area than what was considered at the time.  After these proofs were available to all mathematics, conventional thought then changed as well.  So, where does Cardano's 'solution to the cubic' fit into this?</p><p>I can understand why Cardano's 'solution to the cubic' would be considered a weak Great Theorem.  By today's concept of mathematics Cardano's proof is extremely long, tedious, and doesn't work for all the solutions to the problem.  Cardano was limited by the tools of his time, therefore imaginary, and other possibly real answers could not be obtained by his proof.  Great Theorems aren't about how useful they are today, though.</p><p>A Great Theorem is something that redefined mathematical thought at the time; that changed history into the direction we are now.  Within the solution to the cubic, it took great insight to notice the substitution of x to y - b/3a would get rid of the squared term in the general equation.  It also took great resource skills to make expert use out of all the tools available to him.  This theorem influenced the thought of solving multiple polynomials, by reduction of the middle terms.  Cardano later solved the quadric in this manor.  Three hundred years later, this theorem brought about Abel's proof that you cannot exceed quadric equations through this method; a new method of solving must be devised.</p><p>I agree that Cardano's 'solution to the cubic' is a Great Theorem, because it influenced mathematics and brought about new ideas in their time.  William Dunham, in <i>Journey Through Genius</i>, doesn't give a specific definition of what a Great Theorem is, but he provides great information on how the mathematician came about his discovery and his proof.  From Dunham's example I think a Great Theorem is measured by its impact on the mathematical society, and the illustration through different mathematical thought.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 8, 2003<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">October 4, 2003</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Sandra Collins @ The Quest, Minneapolis</h3><p>These photos are from Sandra Collins' performance at The Quest (now Epic) in Minneapolis, MN on October 4th, 2003.

I decided to show a portion of it during SPAMM social hour tonight, too.</p><p>I did indeed like it quite a bit. Voices shows the struggle of a loving couple through their ever growing distant relationship. Mikako (I think that's the girl's name) is in the space military which is traveling to the ends of our galaxy fighting off some alien race. Noboru, the guy, is on Earth.</p><p>The entire 30-minute OAV encompasses their entire relationship. From the begining as they fall in love in middle school, she is then shipped off to space to fight these aliens because she's an elite pilot or something. They keep in contact through phone mail, and as the military edges closer to the ends of our galaxy, the response time between mail grows from days to months to a year. And then, as the space fleet warps off to the opposing alien galaxy, the response time grows to 8.6 years.</p><p>On Earth, Noboru deals with his love for Mikako and the wait. He wonders about his role as a lover and his role in his own life. At age 15, Mikako sends him a mail as the war begins and ends on the alien home world, 8.6 light years away.  At age 24, Noboru is a distant person. He has kept his away from most social attachments, in the back of his mind waiting for Mikako's words, but also being realistic to himself and taking up his life in the military as well.</p><p>As he leaves for his life in the military, he receives the mail from Mikako, which is basically just a hello, along with audio from her fighting the alien race, and thinking outloud about love and life, and then her victory on the alien world. Noboru smiles and agrees...  and then the episode is over.</p><p>Earlier, I thought that it would have ended better with her dying in space, leaving Noboru with the immortal words of her love. But now, I think I realize her life a little better. It wouldn't matter whether she was alive or dead. Noboru already accepts the fact that he will probably never see her again. And he also accepts the fact that she is the only for him. She means so much to him that no other social attachments matter. In his mind, she'll never disappear.</p><p>If she died, he wouldn't detach himself anymore than he already has, nor would he in his life to come. All his joy belongs to her and without her the joy is gone. Though, even if she returned some day to him. His joy would never return to what they had as children.</p><p>In the end, their joy depletes equally with each other, so if they were to meet and live together again,  they'd understand each other's pain. They'd know and they would be fine with that, even if they couldn't see each other smile on the outside. Their hearts would brighten if even the slightest, and then continue to warm for the rest of their lives.</p><p>The concept of cheating life with light speed travel, and then the social relationships that are ripped and stretched because of it, is something that really grabbed my interest in the classic Gainax series Gunbuster. After the main character finishes high school, she is sent in some mission playing around with light speed. Then as she returns to earth, she is still 18, but 10 or 20 years have passed since that date. All of her friends have grown up, married with kids. She finds one of her high school friends, and they chat and catch up.</p><p>It's interesting. Her friend would probably feel nostalgic, but at the same time envious. She is older. She has aged. Yet, it seems as if her friend, the main character, almost gets a second chance at life. A second chance that she can't experience.</p><p>Anyways, I've found that pure long distance relationships do end up taking away a lot of external emotions. When you speak to them through AIM or email, your emotions are expressed internally as you think of what to write. You become more introverted. You can't do any social activities with them, so you spend your time communicating, rather than "living."</p><p>or perhaps this happens to people who truly seriously pour all their emotions into their relationship because it means so much to them.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on October 1, 2003<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">October 2003</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/voices-of-a-distant-star">1</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/sandra-collins-the-quest">4</a></span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">5</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/fermats-last-theorem">8</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/dance-dance-revolution-extreme">12</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-columbian-exchange">13</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">17</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">19</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">26</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">27</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">31</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
