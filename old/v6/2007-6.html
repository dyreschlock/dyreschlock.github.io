I picked this game up about a month and a half ago, and haven't really put it down since.</p><p>In EDF, the alien invasion has begun, and they've unleashed hordes of mutated gigantic ants, spiders and massive mechanical robots.  Luckily, a few years prior to the alien invasion earth setup a defense force just in case such things would occur.</p><p>You play a lowly pion in the army, and choose from over 150 unlockable weapons to completely eradicate every enemy in sight.  There's really no story, no plot twists or character plots to get in the way of blowing the shit out of robots, gigantic insects and UFOs.</p><p>It's fricken awesome.  "Oh my god.. Ants are crawling up the sides of Tokyo. Blow them the fuck up.  Oh shit, here comes more.  Damn!  Spiders.  Holy crap!  Robots shooting lazers up my ass..  reload reload goddammit..  blow it up..  die!"  Building are completely destructible as well, so firing a rocket into a horde of ants 5 stories up with demolish that business.</p><p>It's really nicely detailed too..   Most large buildings has convenience stores on them actually modeled after REAL convenience stores.  There's a Lawsons, Daily Yamazaki, and others!  Rad-tastic</p><p>____</p><p>Something I just noticed today, though, is that this is actually a remake of the PS2 game which came out back in 2003.  Simple Series Number 31.</p><p>Luckily, Japan never frowns on bad games being made..  they actually encourage it.  Simple Series is a publisher that pretty much publishes games on concept alone, regardless of the end product, and releases it at a budgeted price tag.  Concepts like "a maid versus the mafia", "a bikini clad warrior out to kill zombies", "collecting infected humans in an ambulance before they turn into zombies", or simply.. "defending the earth against gigantic ants and spiders"</p><p>The Simple Series can be found on PS2, PSP and DS..  maybe PS1 as well.  Though, some of these games actually sell pretty good and get sequels and ports to next-gen machines.  Such as the case with EDF.</p><p>Something else I learned today is that 2 years ago, Sandlot made Earth Defense Force 2 (Simple Series #81) and one year ago, they made Earth Defense Force Tactics (Simple Series #103)..  Both these two games come out in Europe today.</p><p>____</p><p>Anyways.. if you own a 360, you owe it to yourself to play Earth Defense Force.  It was released as a budgeted title at $40, but you could rent it just the same. ^_^</p><p>Here's hoping we'll be seeing Earth Defense Force 2 on the 360 in the future.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 27, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 27, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Mechanical Death</h3><p>Yesterday I got a bit of free time, so i was able to go through and get caught up with blogs and forums and actually interact for a change.  I started updating my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">games list</a> as well, and got to the point of taking pictures of my new arrivals.</p><p>I put batteries into my camera and tried to turn it on..  nothing.  "hmm..  batteries must be low.."  I got another set of charged batteries and the same thing occurred.  Nothing..  Silence.. Death..</p><p>Sadness..  It appears my old camera has finally bit the dust.</p><div class='title'><b>A look back..</b></div><p>I received my camera for Christmas of 2002.  Since that time I've taken about 15,000 pictures with it. Even discovered that the camera doesn't know how to count once it goes past 10,000.</p><p>I was quite the shutter bug up until about a year ago..  It started becoming an annoyance carrying around this big 'ol camera..  It wasn't very convenient.  I picked up my picture takin' styles when I got to Japan..  but once again, it began to fade.  Then one drunken night I must've smacked it against a hard surface, because the white balance was extremely sensitive..  It hadn't been the same since..  Pictures came out really bad and washed.</p><p>The last pictures I ended up taking with it was of Justin, Alex and Eric in North Carolina..</p><p>Poor Sony Cybershot..  Dec 2002 - June 2007</p><p>Even though, I didn't actively use it in recent days.. It feels weird not having it.  Like I have no way of photographically recording my life whereas I had the option before.</p><div class='title'><b>A look forward..</b></div><p>Anyways..  I had resigned myself to getting a new sleek tiny powerhouse of a camera, but kept putting it off.  I suppose now I have a good reason to actively look for a new one.  Something small that I can easily port around with me at all times, and something powerful so pictures don't look like ass.  Probably something that uses an SD card so I can easily look at pictures on my Phone and Wii without much hassle.  My laptop has an SD card slot too.</p><p>Since I'm so great at saving and conserving money and have given up credit cards, I'll have to wait a week until I get paid to actually purchase one.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 27, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 26, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Wordpress + Google Reader: RSS 2.0 v. Atom</h3><p>A while ago, when Google Reader decided to lose all my RSS feeds, I went through and re-added as many as I could remember.  And then Google Reader automatically fixed the problem and combined all my original ones with the newly added ones.</p><p>One little interesting thing that occurred was that I signed up for an RSS feed and Atom feed of the same blog.  "ha ha, that's funny," i thought and proceeded to leave it on there.  Mainly because Google Reader made no indication what the difference between the two were.  The particular blog in question is <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org" title="http://blog.t-kun.org">Tony's blog</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>By the way...</b></div><p>An RSS feed is blanket term to describe a simple XML representation of a blog.  Every blogging software has these things built into it these days.  Wordpress, Livejournal, Blogger, etc.. These are separate links that contain all the same data.  <a href="http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom" title="http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom">http://blog.t-kun.org/?feed=atom</a> is the link for the Atom feed of Tony's site.  There are two main types of RSS feeds: an RSS feed and Atom feed.  Both do the same thing and pretty much all feed readers take in both, but have slight syntactical differences and standards.  RSS 2.0 and Atom 1.0 are the current versions.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_%28standard%29">Atom wikipedia</a> article goes into details on the differences between the two.</p><p>An RSS feed reader is a program that takes in all these links and checks them periodically for new articles.  That way you don't have to check 20 sites 20 times a day.  Just check your RSS reader and huzzah .. all new articles you haven't read yet brought into one source.</p><p>If you happen to be reading this post on my site rather than an RSS Feed, and you happen to be using Firefox, take a look at the address bar up top.  See that little orange symbol?  If you click it, Firefox will automatically sign you up for this RSS Feed.  It's just that easy.</p><p>Definitely check out <a href="http://reader.google.com" title="http://reader.google.com">Google's RSS Reader</a> if you haven't, for all your feed reader needs.</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways...</b></div><p>After a week has gone by, I've begun to notice a little difference in the way Wordpress does its rendering of these two feeds.</p><p>First off, let's take a look at the two feeds themselves, side by side.</p><p>RSS 2.0</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss_xml.webp" /></p><p>Atom</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom_xml.webp" /></p><p>(These are screenshots of wordpad because Wordpress cannot display xml or code in general nicely at all... ><;; )</p><p>You can start to see the little differences, but the meat of the article is retained.  What's really weird is how Google Reader renders this particular article</p><p>Google Reader + RSS</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_rss.webp" /></p><p>Google Reader + Atom</p><p class='img'><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tony/tony_atom.webp" /></p><p>Weird..  Google Reader takes the Atom at face value, rather than rendering out that ascii code as in the RSS feed.</p><p>Also, for some reason, I seem to get the Atom version an hour later than the RSS version (despite the article time being the same).  also weird..</p><div class='title'><b>uh...</b></div><p>Anyways, I don't really have an explanation for this.  I'm not sure what version of Wordpress Tony is using, but I'd guess its not Wordpress 2.2, which was released a couple of weeks ago, WHICH, I would assume actually uses Atom 1.0 rather than Atom 0.3 that Tony's Atom feed suggests.  Actually, looking at the XML, Tony is using 2.0.4.</p><p>:shrugs: I thought it was an interesting little tidbit.  I wonder if Google Reader's feed fetching of Atom 1.0 is better than 0.3.  I also wonder if Wordpress 2.2 isn't as annoying as Wordpress 2.whatever version i have.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 26, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 19, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">New Car</h3><p>One of these days, I'll actually get a new car.  Not necessarily another car, but a brand-spanking new car that will solely be my responsibility, and not the fault of the previous drivers.  But the obvious question arises..  What car do i buy?  What car defines me as a person?  Such a difficult question.  I've been toying with many different car choices, so I thought i'd put them side-by-side to compare.</p><div class='title'><b>Subaru WRX</b></div><p>I love this car a lot.  It was bread from the infamous Imprezza Rally car we've seen so much of.  It's cute, sporty, and fast.  However, it's a bit expensive and gets shitty gas mileage.  It's start off at around $25,000 and gets about 20 mpg city / 27 mpg highway.  That's about the same gas mileage my current gets and it just went over 100,000 miles!  I like style, but I'm not going be in the same boat for gasoline.</p><p>Sorry, WRX.  I might test drive you, but the closest to owning you I will ever get will be in Gran Turismo.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Sweet, Pretty, Fast, Japanese, Uncommon<br/><b>Con's</b>: Price, Gas Mileage, everything that matters.</p><div class='title'><b>Toyota Prius</b></div><p>Given the new fad of not paying up the ass in gasoline, I focused my sights on the Prius, known for the best mileage on the planet.  60 City, 55 Highway.  Though, reports have been saying those numbers are grossly inflated, the real problem with the Prius is its life expectancy.  Apparently, these cars only live to 100,000 miles, then they start having weird errors and just begin to die out on you.  100,000 miles is about 8 years, give or take..  I'd have to pay off the thing by then, or else I'll be paying for a dead car.  The thing costs $25,000 in the first place.  On average it gets about 2 to 2.5 times the mileage as a WRX, but my WRX is going to live about 2 to 2.5 times as long..  It'd be better off getting a WRX..  at least then I wouldn't be driving a chick car.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Gas Mileage, Good for Enviroment, Japanese<br/><b>Con's</b>: Price, Life Expectancy, Reputable as a Girl's Car, Very Common</p><div class='title'><b>Volkswagen Jetta</b></div><p>Whatever..  I started looking at a car that has proved itself time and time again.  The good 'ol Jetta costs about $17,000 and gets about 40 mpg on average.  Though dealerships seem to indicate it gets shitty gas mileage, Jetta owners will proudly let you know they get an average of 40+ miles.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Gas Mileage, Price, "German Engineering in the House" commercial, not Japanese but still Foreign<br/><b>Con's</b>: Common, Reputable as Girl's Car, Jetta Owners have same mentality as Mac Users.</p><p>So if I sacrifice all amounts of style for cost effectiveness, we've got the Jetta.  Eh, sounds pretty good to me..</p><p>I put Common as a Con, but that's really from a stylistic point of view.  Functional-wise, the more common a car the better because more people will have parts and knowledge to service it if/when it breaks.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 19, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 17, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Xbox 360 Demos</h3><p>On Friday, I spent a fair amount of time downloading a bunch of demos for the 360 that seemed pretty interesting.</p><div class='title'><b>Project Silpheed</b></div><p>This is Squaresoft's first 360 game, so I had to give it a go.  Project Silpheed, not to be confused with the real Silpheed game series, and a 3D chase-view shmup set in space, kinda like Descent or Colony Wars.  You basically fly around and blow shit up.. just like any shmup.  The controls are so goddamn intricate, spending half an hour going through the tutorial is almost required.  In fact Penny Arcade did a <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/06/08" title="http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2007/06/08">comic</a> on it.</p><p>On top of that, the game really isn't all that fun.  It's more of a chore to fly around and pick off all the enemy planes..  only to get killed in 3 direct hits by one lucky fellow.  Pass</p><div class='title'><b>Tenchu Z</b></div><p>Tenchu is probably one of my favorite games of all time.  In its core, it wasn't a particularly good game.  The gameplay on its own is nearly passable and was largely over shadowed by Metal Gear Solid at the time.  The AI of the enemies was dumb..  You could stand next to them and they detect you.  BUT the music was simply beautiful.  It has one of the must in-depth, powerful, and simply stunning soundtracks of any Playstation title.</p><p>There have been many sequels to Tenchu, but none have captured the essence of the original.  All have been shitty buggy clones with crappy music.  Why can't they just get the original composer's back and bring the franchise back to its glory days...?</p><p>Anyways, I saw the demo on Xbox Live and gave it a go.  Tenchu is a stealthy ninja game, where you kill your enemies without being detected.  You can grappled on top of buildings, jump down behind your enemy, and cut him open without him seeing you.</p><p>Tenchu Z actually surprised me a bit.  I felt like a was brought into the past and playing Tenchu for the first time again.  Everything seemed largely the same.  Scaling rooftops, dumbass easy-to-kill AI..  But it is missing two big things for me to fall completely in love: The music and the wicked.  The music in the demo is soft, subtle and boring, which means you never pay attention to it, which means it doesn't engross you into the environment.  Music will pull and guide you into any world the game or movie present.  I would put sound on par with anything sight can do..  So to completely fail at any auditory is a huge blow to the over all experience of the game.</p><p>The other thing the <b>demo</b> fails at is the overall wicked-ness of the original Tenchu.  Like with the skeleton baby cult, and lust for crazy fat people.  This is just a demo, so there's no way they'd get into any of the this stuff just yet..  Hopefully they will..  I'd be disappointed if there wasn't.</p><p>So...  if you've got a 360 and loved Tenchu back in the day, why not check it out.  It's certainly not as good as the original, but it's not too bad.  The demo said that the full game has 50+ missions in it, and plenty of customizable outfits, faces, and weapons.  It's been 9 years since the original came out..  relive the magic in its beaten up, broken down form.</p><p>I'll probably pick it up, if I could find it for $40.  $60 is way too much for this game..</p><p>Edit: Crap.. Tenchu Z just came out this week..  finding it for less than $60 will be difficult..  maybe i'll rent it.</p><div class='title'><b>DiRT</b></div><p>DiRT is a rally racing game which stole NiGHTS' and SiCKO's capitalization styles. The demo has a very arcade style of selecting cars and tracks.  Unlike the convoluted, over customization of Gran Turismo and Forza motorsports, You pick your car, pick your track, and away you go.  This is probably a little different in the actual game.</p><p>The graphics are simply beautiful.  Highly detailed cars, environments, etc..  What's really amazing in the damage you inflict on your car.  The slightest scratch or bump will change the appearance of your car and when you slam into a side-rail..?  Blam!  The front of the car is scrunched accordion style, while the hood is slightly torn up.  The side-rail has a huge dent in it next at the point of impact.</p><p>The damage is quite realistic, and sounds are so blunt and powerful..  It's hard to not have fun beating the shit out of your car.  Bushes, actually have mass too, and can scrape out your nice fine finish.  I've never seen a game take damage to the environment as seriously as taking damage to the car.</p><p>The thing I love about this game the most though, is the menu navigation.  I should really get some sort of screenshoting software to explain it.  It's a 2D menu in a 3D space..  kinda like the Wipeout Fusion menu, except when you select something, you fly around space to the next menu.  Each menu has a reflective text, so it shimmers in the light when you move across it.</p><p>Anyways, DiRT is a lot of fun despite being developed by codemasters, who special in making sub-par games.  It comes out this week for the 360, and in a couple of months for the PS3.  Definitely a rent title, but I would probably pick it up for $40 on the PS3 if there wasn't anything else going on at that time.</p><p>____</p><p>Huzzah.. fun times all around.  Definitely download these demos to see for yourself..  Especially the DiRT demo.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 17, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 17, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Big Brain Academy impressions</h3><p>This week, <b>Big Brain Academy</b> joins the ranks of Cooking Mama and Trauma Center as another DS title remade and ported to your television.  And much like Cooking Mama and Trauma Center, it is identical to the DS title with minor tweaks, changes and multi-player modes added.</p><p>Today I finally broke down and picked it up.  Knowing that $50 is way too damn much for this game..  Knowing there are only 15 mini-games in this whole package..  After checking blockbuster each day hoping they'd have it..  After keeping myself away from Best Buy, Shopko, and all those other places where I'd be tempted to purchase it..  Even after telling myself over and over again that I can just wait a week and Resident Evil 4 will be out on the Wii..  After all that..  I caught a thread on Cheap Ass Gamer, stating it was $40 this week at Circuit City.  and.. I came across an article which said I could get a free Wii-mote keychain.  So whatever..  I picked it up.</p><p>Bad Choice.</p><p>Big Brain Academy boasts its depth in bulking up and building your brain, but offers the most shallow presentation, gameplay, and overall quality on the Wii alongside Wii Play.</p><p>For single player modes you have training and practice.  With training, you delve through 5 areas of focus with 10 puzzles each.  For each area a weight is calculated to determine how massive your brain is.  These are totaled up and kept track of.  Sounds like fun eh?  As some of my old roommates said, "wow..  it's like they made a game based off of school that's actually as boring as school."</p><p>You also have practice mode where you can go through each area one by one, on any difficulty and get bronze, silver, gold or platinum medals for your successes.</p><p>Multiplayer has 3 different modes that use all these same games.</p><p>And... that's it.  I'm already fricken bored of it.  It does have a little connectivity online, but that's only to compare your brain's weight to others in your Wii address book.</p><p>Much like the DS titles, it seems like this is the type of game you play for 15 to 30 minutes a day and improve your brain's capacity.  That works great for the DS because it's a portable system.  It's designed for pick-up, play and put-away type games like this.  The Wii is a home console..  people don't spend full price on a snack size game when they expect a full meal.</p><p>Honestly, so far the Wii library has done a horrible job at making an actual compelling game to sink time into..  Luckily they ported Twilight Princess, so you can throw that argument back in my face.</p><p>Anyways, why didn't they just forget about the multiplayer, beef up the online connectivity, and release this as a $20 downloadable channel in Shop Channel?  It seems like such a waste to have this tiny game on an entire disc..  If I'm only going to spend 10 or 15 minutes playing it, I don't want to have to switch discs every single time.  I want it easily accessible like the 'Everyone Votes' channel.  Would you spend $50 for that?</p><p>If you really want to play this game, I suggest you rent it..  If you really want to buy it, though..  wait until it's $20.. or hell..  you could just buy it off me.  I already registered it for the Wii-mote key chain though.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 17, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 8, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">This just in: PSP Slim Data</h3><p>http://www.kotaku.com/gaming/rumor/psp-slim-details-revealed-267108.php</p><p>Kotaku has come across some more details of the PSP Slim</p><p>- sharper screen<br/>- smaller screen<br/>- extended battery life<br/>- faster UMD drive for shorter load times<br/>- 8 gigs internal flash memory<br/>- revamped buttons</p><p>- no dual analog stick, though<br/>- no touchscreen (like it needs one)<br/>- probably no built-in camera</p><p>- official unveiled at E3<br/>- probably around $170<br/>- end-august / september release date</p><p>The loading times have been my greatest turn off of the PSP, right behind the fragility of the piece.  It never seemed like tugging that piece of equipment around with actually practical.</p><p>The other initial problem with the machine were the Games.  I think it has gotten to the point where there are some pretty fun games on the system warranting a purchase.  Games like:</p><p>- Lumines I/II<br/>- Every Extend Extra<br/>- Loco Roco<br/>- Wipeout Pure/Pulse<br/>- Metal Gear Solid OPs<br/>- new Silent Hill<br/>- Final Fantasy VII-2</p><p>and also</p><p>- Gradius Collection<br/>- Parodius Collection<br/>- IQ Mania<br/>- Valkyrie Profile<br/>- some NIS games<br/>- and that puzzle/rhythm game Tony always talks about</p><p>I've been waiting for a reason to pick up a PSP and looks like it's finally arrived..  This is pretty similar to when the DS Lite was announced for me.

I set up this whole elaborate CRUD application to add in all this data, but when it got to the Users actually entering in an OGNL expression for a specified Class..  they were somewhat baffled.  When looking at a screen with a Class name and a blank text field, how are you supposed to know which OGNL expressions you can use?</p><p>I can't expect the User to have the entire application's API memorized in their head.  So, it was no surprise that the first suggestion on my CRUD page was a list of the Class's methods.  Of course, not all the methods..  just the ones that play nice with OGNL.</p><p>Getting at these methods is dirt simple when you have the Class object of what you're working with.<br/><pre>Class object = MyClass.class;<br/>Method[] publicMethods = object.getMethods();</pre><br/>huzzah..</p><p>getMethods() will only return the methods visible to anyone.  Since private and protected methods are not accessible to just anyone, you'll only get the public methods.  Of course, this will return every single public method from every super class..  so you'll get a bunch of methods from Object and other classes that have information you don't really care about.  Use this instead:<br/><pre>Method[] publicMethods = object.getDeclaredMethods();</pre><br/>getDeclaredMethods() will only return methods declared within the Class itself (and are only visible to anyone).  But, we probably want some methods from super classes that are interesting.  Thus begins the filtering out process.<br/>______</p><p>Anyways, now that I've got my Method, I want a couple things from it: a) the Name of the Method, b) the Return Type, and c) the Declaring class.  Mostly, I want to mimic the basic method list that pops up when developing in an IDE.  Well, it just so happens the Method has all this information built in for me.<br/><pre>String methodName = method.getName();<br/>Class returnType = method.getReturnType();<br/>Class declaringClass = method.getDeclaringClass();</pre><br/>It's all pretty self explanatory until I got a new request yesterday about all this.  Some of these methods return Lists, Sets, Collections and like and when it displays this information, OGNL simply uses toString() which doesn't look pretty at all.  It usually prints out something like this:<br/><pre>[MyClass info info, MyClass info info, MyClass info info]</pre><br/>The request was to add some way of stylizing the object within a Collection, which wasn't too tough.  I added another OGNL expression value to the CRUD page and intercepted the value going into the List Component..  but now I'm back at the beginning.  Another blank text field will no idea what to put in it, and this time I don't even have the Class.  Luckily, reflection is here to save the day.</p><p>Let's say this is my class:<br/><pre>public class MyClass<br/>{<br/>...<br/>private List otherClasses = new ArrayList();<br/>...<br/>public List getOtherClasses()<br/>{<br/>return otherClasses;<br/>}<br/>}</pre><br/>and I've got my Method object of getOtherClasses.  You might be tempted to do this:<br/><pre>method.getTypeParameters()</pre><br/>which returns an Array of TypeVariables.  These are the declaring Generic types, rather than the declared types, so you'd get the letter E, rather than OtherClass, since the declaration of List looks like:<br/><pre>public class List&lt;E&gt;</pre><br/>This baffled me for a while, but it makes sense after thinking about it.  This is the return type and its properties.  On its own, it is completely independent from your Method.  After much searching around and asking for help, Method has another helpful function:<br/><pre>Type returnType = method.getGenericReturnType()</pre><br/>I was always looking for the generic type on the return type's Class rather than the Method.  As far as I can tell, this will return two different Object which extend Type: either a Class equal to the Return Type, or a ParameterizedType.  The ParameterizedType holds the owner and the generic parameters.<br/><pre>if(method.getGenericReturnType() instanceof ParameterizedTypeImpl)<br/>{<br/>for(Type type : ((ParameterizedTypeImpl) method.getGenericReturnType()).getActualTypeArguments())<br/>{<br/>genericsOfReturnType.add((Class) type);<br/>}<br/>}</pre><br/>Now my little dynamic API window on my CRUD page is complete.  I wonder if this is how javadoc compiles all of its html pages.<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 5, 2007<br/></span></div><br/><h2 class="date">June 1, 2007</h2><div class="blogbody"><h3 class="title">Moving Days</h3><p>Moving is always kinda fun.  It gives me a chance to flex those dormant Tetris skills and maximize the amount of volume my stuff will take up in my car while minimizing the amount of containers holding my things, thus minimizing the amount of trips i need to make going back and forth between residence and automobile.  Once again, i was able to fit all of my stuff into my car, minus a book shelf, desk and chair, despite the least amount of volume I've ever had to work with, though it was quite a tight fit.</p><p>Wednesday, when I returned from my North Carolina trip, I was greeted by my roommates fast at work emptying out our house into their trucks and cars.  Except for my clothes, all of my things were already boxed up and stuffed into my room before flying away.  I joined them and moved my things into my car.  It took me about an hour to stuff my car full, but i still had all my clothes laying around and some other random stuff.</p><p>The night continued with throwing most of the uncontested items of our household into garbage bags and hurling them onto the curb.  Once we got rid of all that junk, the house really began to come together and look amazingly clean.  I rode with my now ex-roommates over to their new place and moved some of their things up into their place.  They scored a quaint tiny place about 2 blocks away from the capitol.  The perfect living quarters after bar hopping across State St.</p><p>We made one more trip back to the old home and get rid of all the garbage bags outside.</p><p>The next day, yesterday, I woke up a bit late and rolled out of bed.  After showering, I grabbed the reminder of my possessions in the house, and bid adieu.  With the back-end of my car weighed  down heavily, I puttered to work.  Gage calls me up during my lunch and says that we could move into our new place today if I went down to the office and signed a contract.  huzzah.  Looks like I wasn't homeless for too long after all.  I phoned up Kyle to tell him that we're moving in today.</p><p>After work we began moving everything into our new place.  Our new place sits on the end of a cul-de-sac, nestled softly between several other homes.  From the street, the driveway is a 35 degrees incline (maybe more) leading up to the house, which is about 20 feet above the street below.  My room is on the Second and a Half floor of the house, but moving things from my car up there totaled about a 4 story climb. :/</p><p>After a vigorous workout of handling furniture and boxes up the hill, and walking back down, our stuff was once again sheltered under a tall roof and sheet rocked walls.</p><p>Moving is always pretty easy for me.  I have container for everything I own and never have more on me than what I can't drive away with.  I've gotten in this habit from moving around so much in the past 6 years of my life.  Moving back and forth between Minneapolis and Platteville for so long, and then Madison, Nagasaki, then Madison again this past year. Of course, I usually had a van or a station-wagon to move everything around with.<br/>It gets annoying when I help people move and they don't have a clear grasp of how they want their stuff to go from point A to point B.  The more boxes of varying size and the less trips back and forth the better!<br/></p><a name="more"></a><span class="posted">Posted by dyre on June 1, 2007<br/></span></div></div></div><div id="links"><div class="calendar" align="center"><table summary="Monthly calendar with links to each day's posts" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4" border="0"><caption class="calendarhead">June 2007</caption><tbody><tr><th align="center" abbr="Sunday"><span class="calendarCell">Sun</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Monday"><span class="calendarCell">Mon</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Tuesday"><span class="calendarCell">Tue</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Wednesday"><span class="calendarCell">Wed</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Thursday"><span class="calendarCell">Thu</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Friday"><span class="calendarCell">Fri</span></th><th align="center" abbr="Saturday"><span class="calendarCell">Sat</span></th></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">&nbsp;</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/moving-days">1</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">2</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">3</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">4</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/reflection-with-generics">5</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">6</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">7</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/this-just-in-psp-slim-data">8</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">9</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">10</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">11</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">12</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">13</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">14</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">15</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">16</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/xbox-360-demos">17</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">18</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/new-car">19</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">20</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">21</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">22</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">23</span></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">24</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">25</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/wordpress-google-reader-rss-20-v-atom">26</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell"><a href="/old/v6/the-earth-defense-force">27</a></span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">28</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">29</span></td><td align="center"><span class="calendarCell">30</span></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="sidetitle">
