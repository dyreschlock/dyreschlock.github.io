Between Friday and Saturday morning, I watched the first 3 of the DVDs, totaling 9 episodes, an hour each.  Saturday night, I watched the next 2 DVDs by myself, and now I'm down to one remaining.</p><p>The more you get into this show, the formula really begins to set in.  I think the best way to describe this show is a mix between an after-school special, That 70s Show, and the Wonder years.  Most of the geeky jokes in the movie are really time centric with taking place in 1980.  A star wars reference here..  a star trek reference there..  Dallas, Welcome back Cotter..  It's the same formula that That 70s Show did until it began focusing on the characters.</p><p>This show has really begun to depress me, so I'm not really sure why I decided to binge on another six episodes..  I guess I couldn't stay away..  I think I'm going to lock up those final 3 episodes to watch them later on in the future.  How fitting that these final 3 episodes were never aired until ABC family picked up the syndication rights..</p><p>My old Madison roommates are somewhat on the same mind, but with Knocked Up, inside of Freaks and Geeks.  One of them relates to that movie with the same disdain because that was a life he almost lead.  The same feelings of entrapment and solid future were those he couldn't handle.</p><div class='title'><b>Suburbia</b></div><p>Freaks and Geeks really reminds me of the first Richard Linklater movie I saw..  Suburbia.  The first time I saw this movie, I was in awe with its realism.  Much like Freaks and Geeks, It really stuck with me for the next couple of days.</p><p>I've only seen it once, so I'm somewhat hazy on what point in time it takes place.  It was the last night in early September before all these high school friends went to college, the army, and another had a record deal.  This was the last day of their lives as citizen of their suburban town before they ventured into the world.  I think the year was 1985, or something like that.</p><p>Since it was their last night, they went through a wide range of emotions..  celebration, excitement, fear, loss..  pre-mature homesickness..  Their venture into the unknown..  A world outside theiir own.</p><div class='title'><b>Tangent</b></div><p>I saw this movie when I was a sophomore or junior in high school, so I viewed it as the same sort of fears I was supposed to have once I finished high school..  except I had no clue what the hell I was going to do at the time.</p><p>I was somewhat excited for this moment to happen for me..  To be at that point of no return with my high school friends, say goodbye for the final time and really feel for each other..  That never came for me..  Really, It was only until the end of last year and leaving Japan that I had that moment..  A conversation that ended on the tone that I would never see you again and I'm glad I met you...</p><p>That moment was real..  The moment was heartfelt..  With all my other friends in Japan..  I just turn on my computer and they're all on Instant Messenger..  but with that one person and that one moment.  It was the edge of the universe..</p><div class='title'><b>Scanner Darkly</b></div><p>Out of all other Linklater's movies, Scanner Darkly is the only other one that scratches at my emotions on some level.  There's only a few scenes that convey that slice of life feel, but I see myself in them none-the-less.  I think I'll leave it at that though...</p><div class='title'><b>Anyways..</b></div><p>Now that I've seen Freaks and Geeks, I must see Undeclared.  I must see Judd Apatow's second building block of his cast of social rejects..  but, I really don't want to buy it.  I love Freaks and Geeks, but I probably could have gotten away with just borrowing it from someone..  I'll probably watch it again with someone who hasn't seen it, but never on my own.</p><p>There are a bunch of other TV shows I'd like to see too, like My So Called Life (as recommended by Erika), Californication, Weeds, Carnivale...  I'd also like to pick up where I left off with Six Feet Under (even though, Matt says the rest is dull).</p><p>Soooo....  maybe I'll start up a netflix account.  After comparing Blockbuster online versus Netflix, I think I'll definitely go with Netflix.  If Blockbuster had a video game service mixed in with DVDs, then there'd be no contest, but they don't.  And with their prices exactly the same, It really comes down to selection and with more Television shows, Anime, and obscure foreign movies Netflix has Blockbuster beat.Â  Also, If I miss an episode of Heroes, I can watch it from netflix.com rather than nbc's crappy browser player.</p><p>I wonder how long it would take to get Undeclared disc 1 if I signed up now....</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p align="right"><font class="nam">- Dyre</font></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p align="right"><font class="txt">October 28, 2007</font></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><p align="center"><a CLASS="one" onClick="javascript:window.close();" href="#"><font>- close window -</font></a></p></td></tr></table></div></body></html>
