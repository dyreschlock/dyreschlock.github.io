It was really the first time I had taken a "reality" tour for a film.</p><p>Though, the whole trip was shadowed by the overwhelming sense of being watched and unwanted.  People just didn't seem friendly at all.  I was taking some photos and saw some junior high students walking by.  I said, "Hello," and got nothing back.  They just looked at me as if I had no business being there.  Shopkeepers were very short with their dialog, too.</p><p>Perhaps thats because the usual foreigners that visit Taiji knew about the city from the film, so the local people assume they're there to do them harm.</p><p>The town just didn't feel right.
