So instead of going into the office I can do whatever I want.  Funny that, I ended up spending close to 6 hours both finishing up that poorly written Metroid Prime and migrating all my Movable Type journal entries to this Wordpress blog.</p><p>The main bulk of that time was cutting out the 24,000 comments from prescription drug companies, magazine, and pornographic websites.  After toying around, they were all posted on one article, so cutting them out was pretty easy.</p><div class='title'><b>Exporting Movable Type into Wordpress</b></div><p>Movable Type's exporting is quite amazing, by the way.  It dumps all the articles into a text file   They have a bizzare format, but it's still pretty readable:<br/><pre>--------<br/>AUTHOR: dyre<br/>TITLE: stuff?<br/>STATUS: Draft<br/>ALLOW COMMENTS: 0<br/>CONVERT BREAKS: __default__<br/>ALLOW PINGS: 0<br/>PRIMARY CATEGORY: daily<br/>CATEGORY: daily</p><p>DATE: 10/09/2003 08:43:39 AM<br/>-----<br/>BODY:<br/>omitted boring emotional text.<br/>-----<br/>EXTENDED BODY:</p><p>-----<br/>EXCERPT:</p><p>-----<br/>KEYWORDS:</p><p>-----</pre><br/><pre><br/>--------</pre><br/>Even though Wordpress is an annoying piece of crap, it has a convient "import from Movable Type" feature, which is very helpful.  So Importing all these old entries really only took 5 minutes.  200 more articles in 5 whole minutes..  not bad.</p><div class='title'><b>Upkeep on old stale articles</b></div><p>Despite my best judgement, I decided not to cut out content related to my life at the time, so there's plenty of school related articles talking about how lazy I can be, what classes I was attending, what homework I need to do and also several articles talking about my girlfriend at the time.</p><p>All those personal articles really tappered off when broke up with her and took a 9 or 10 month break from the internet, so around April 2004 my articles became more about the subject I was writting about and less about what I did that weekend or how I felt about the crushing stress of finishing off a semester at Platteville.  Paints an emotional picture doesn't it?</p><p>To fit all these new articles, I added a couple new categories, and also organized them into sub-groups.  I also made an <b>Opinion</b> category for all my reviews, gamelogs, and impressions about various Games, Moves, Music Events and such.</p><div class='title'><b>Still more</b></div><p>There are still plenty of articles that predate installing Movable Type that I haven't gathered up, but I could easily make a program that would convert all those entries into a Movable Type backup file, and have Wordpress import them.  Handy!</p><p>Many of these are very old reviews, but are still pretty funny..  like my Treasure Planet review, Kingdom Hearts review, and Magnolia review..  Now that I finished up Metroid, maybe that's what I'll work on.</p><div class='title'><b>Bored?</b></div><p>Well, if you're really bored, feel free to go back in time and read all those articles.  It's not like these haven't already been on the internet over at <a href="/journal" title="/journal">theschlock.com/journal</a>, so you don't really gain anything new from reading them, unless you haven't read them.  You'd probably want to use the Search engine and category trees to your advantage to finding the better articles though.</p><p>Some of my old reviews are kinda funny at least.  especially my timely <a href="/metriod-prime-2-impressions" title="/metriod-prime-2-impressions">Metroid Prime 2 review</a>.</p><div class='title'><b>ADVICE</b></div><p>by the way, NEVER use wordpress's entry edited for writing your blog posts.  Wordpress uses some funky CSS and Javascript to make your articles look like they do after you submit them.  BUT because of this, the text field is not longer a trackable DOM field.  SO when you submit an article, the text is immediately whisked away to the HTTP request and the field is blanked out.</p><p>What does this mean?  It means if you end up getting any browser errors, domain errors.. basically any error at all: <b><em>You lose your entire post!</em></b>  I've had this happen to me enough, that I don't even use the editor unless I'm actually edited an entry.</p><p>I use Wordpad to actually write out all my entries, and then I just copy and paste them into the editor, hit save, and then hit publish.</p><p>I'm currently using Wordpress 2.0.4, so maybe they've fixed it, but I'm not taking any chances anymore.  Especially when Firefox is somewhat buggy too and can crash at will.</p><p>Something to think about anyways..</p><p align="right" class="name"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/><p class="x"><font class="dat">August 19, 2007</font></p><p>This weekend, I headed home to gather large amounts of possessions in a effort to rid myself of them.  Throughout the years, I've accumulated quite a bit of stuff, much of which was a completely unnecessary purchase, or something I bought "spur of the moment", or any other random excuses you can think of.</p><p>I think it's time for my collection to go through a purge to trim away the fat/useless items and increase the quality of my collection and give way for new items as they should come.</p><p>Here's the big 'ol list: <a href="/schlock-for-sale" title="/schlock-for-sale">http://theschlock.com/photo/070818_stuff/schlock_for_sale.txt</a></p><p>Most of it is Anime VHS, but there's plenty of other stuff on there too.

I started updating my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">games list</a> as well, and got to the point of taking pictures of my new arrivals.</p><p>I put batteries into my camera and tried to turn it on..  nothing.  "hmm..  batteries must be low.."  I got another set of charged batteries and the same thing occurred.  Nothing..  Silence.. Death..</p><p>Sadness..  It appears my old camera has finally bit the dust.</p><div class='title'><b>A look back..</b></div><p>I received my camera for Christmas of 2002.  Since that time I've taken about 15,000 pictures with it. Even discovered that the camera doesn't know how to count once it goes past 10,000.</p><p>I was quite the shutter bug up until about a year ago..  It started becoming an annoyance carrying around this big 'ol camera..  It wasn't very convenient.  I picked up my picture takin' styles when I got to Japan..  but once again, it began to fade.  Then one drunken night I must've smacked it against a hard surface, because the white balance was extremely sensitive..  It hadn't been the same since..  Pictures came out really bad and washed.</p><p>The last pictures I ended up taking with it was of Justin, Alex and Eric in North Carolina..</p><p>Poor Sony Cybershot..  Dec 2002 - June 2007</p><p>Even though, I didn't actively use it in recent days.. It feels weird not having it.  Like I have no way of photographically recording my life whereas I had the option before.</p><div class='title'><b>A look forward..</b></div><p>Anyways..  I had resigned myself to getting a new sleek tiny powerhouse of a camera, but kept putting it off.  I suppose now I have a good reason to actively look for a new one.  Something small that I can easily port around with me at all times, and something powerful so pictures don't look like ass.  Probably something that uses an SD card so I can easily look at pictures on my Phone and Wii without much hassle.  My laptop has an SD card slot too.</p><p>Since I'm so great at saving and conserving money and have given up credit cards, I'll have to wait a week until I get paid to actually purchase one.</p><p align="right" class="name"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/><p class="x"><font class="dat">June 19, 2007</font></p><p>One of these days, I'll actually get a new car.  Not necessarily another car, but a brand-spanking new car that will solely be my responsibility, and not the fault of the previous drivers.  But the obvious question arises..  What car do i buy?  What car defines me as a person?  Such a difficult question.  I've been toying with many different car choices, so I thought i'd put them side-by-side to compare.</p><div class='title'><b>Subaru WRX</b></div><p>I love this car a lot.  It was bread from the infamous Imprezza Rally car we've seen so much of.  It's cute, sporty, and fast.  However, it's a bit expensive and gets shitty gas mileage.  It's start off at around $25,000 and gets about 20 mpg city / 27 mpg highway.  That's about the same gas mileage my current gets and it just went over 100,000 miles!  I like style, but I'm not going be in the same boat for gasoline.</p><p>Sorry, WRX.  I might test drive you, but the closest to owning you I will ever get will be in Gran Turismo.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Sweet, Pretty, Fast, Japanese, Uncommon<br/><b>Con's</b>: Price, Gas Mileage, everything that matters.</p><div class='title'><b>Toyota Prius</b></div><p>Given the new fad of not paying up the ass in gasoline, I focused my sights on the Prius, known for the best mileage on the planet.  60 City, 55 Highway.  Though, reports have been saying those numbers are grossly inflated, the real problem with the Prius is its life expectancy.  Apparently, these cars only live to 100,000 miles, then they start having weird errors and just begin to die out on you.  100,000 miles is about 8 years, give or take..  I'd have to pay off the thing by then, or else I'll be paying for a dead car.  The thing costs $25,000 in the first place.  On average it gets about 2 to 2.5 times the mileage as a WRX, but my WRX is going to live about 2 to 2.5 times as long..  It'd be better off getting a WRX..  at least then I wouldn't be driving a chick car.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Gas Mileage, Good for Enviroment, Japanese<br/><b>Con's</b>: Price, Life Expectancy, Reputable as a Girl's Car, Very Common</p><div class='title'><b>Volkswagen Jetta</b></div><p>Whatever..  I started looking at a car that has proved itself time and time again.  The good 'ol Jetta costs about $17,000 and gets about 40 mpg on average.  Though dealerships seem to indicate it gets shitty gas mileage, Jetta owners will proudly let you know they get an average of 40+ miles.</p><p><b>Pro's</b>: Gas Mileage, Price, "German Engineering in the House" commercial, not Japanese but still Foreign<br/><b>Con's</b>: Common, Reputable as Girl's Car, Jetta Owners have same mentality as Mac Users.</p><p>So if I sacrifice all amounts of style for cost effectiveness, we've got the Jetta.  Eh, sounds pretty good to me..</p><p>I put Common as a Con, but that's really from a stylistic point of view.  Functional-wise, the more common a car the better because more people will have parts and knowledge to service it if/when it breaks.</p><p align="right" class="name"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/><p class="x"><font class="dat">June 1, 2007</font></p><p>Moving is always kinda fun.  It gives me a chance to flex those dormant Tetris skills and maximize the amount of volume my stuff will take up in my car while minimizing the amount of containers holding my things, thus minimizing the amount of trips i need to make going back and forth between residence and automobile.  Once again, i was able to fit all of my stuff into my car, minus a book shelf, desk and chair, despite the least amount of volume I've ever had to work with, though it was quite a tight fit.</p><p>Wednesday, when I returned from my North Carolina trip, I was greeted by my roommates fast at work emptying out our house into their trucks and cars.  Except for my clothes, all of my things were already boxed up and stuffed into my room before flying away.  I joined them and moved my things into my car.  It took me about an hour to stuff my car full, but i still had all my clothes laying around and some other random stuff.</p><p>The night continued with throwing most of the uncontested items of our household into garbage bags and hurling them onto the curb.  Once we got rid of all that junk, the house really began to come together and look amazingly clean.  I rode with my now ex-roommates over to their new place and moved some of their things up into their place.  They scored a quaint tiny place about 2 blocks away from the capitol.  The perfect living quarters after bar hopping across State St.</p><p>We made one more trip back to the old home and get rid of all the garbage bags outside.</p><p>The next day, yesterday, I woke up a bit late and rolled out of bed.  After showering, I grabbed the reminder of my possessions in the house, and bid adieu.  With the back-end of my car weighed  down heavily, I puttered to work.  Gage calls me up during my lunch and says that we could move into our new place today if I went down to the office and signed a contract.  huzzah.  Looks like I wasn't homeless for too long after all.  I phoned up Kyle to tell him that we're moving in today.</p><p>After work we began moving everything into our new place.  Our new place sits on the end of a cul-de-sac, nestled softly between several other homes.  From the street, the driveway is a 35 degrees incline (maybe more) leading up to the house, which is about 20 feet above the street below.  My room is on the Second and a Half floor of the house, but moving things from my car up there totaled about a 4 story climb. :/</p><p>After a vigorous workout of handling furniture and boxes up the hill, and walking back down, our stuff was once again sheltered under a tall roof and sheet rocked walls.</p><p>Moving is always pretty easy for me.  I have container for everything I own and never have more on me than what I can't drive away with.  I've gotten in this habit from moving around so much in the past 6 years of my life.  Moving back and forth between Minneapolis and Platteville for so long, and then Madison, Nagasaki, then Madison again this past year.Â  Of course, I usually had a van or a station-wagon to move everything around with.<br/>It gets annoying when I help people move and they don't have a clear grasp of how they want their stuff to go from point A to point B.  The more boxes of varying size and the less trips back and forth the better!</p><p align="right" class="name"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/><p class="x"><font class="dat">May 13, 2007</font></p><p>Every since returning to the states and living in Madison, I've been going commando..  as far as furniture goes.  With only a few weeks before I move across town, laying down on the floor, tip-typing away no longer appeals to me all that much.

Luckily, if i still want to use a computer like a hobo, i've got my handy laptop fixed.</p><p>The whole black and white theme could be quite attractive, but several pieces on my desk need repairment to promote it.  Some new white computer speakers would be rad, and possible a new mouse too.  I've had those computer speakers for nearly 8 years.  I guess they'll just be another computer hand-me-down for my parents.</p><p>Thanks go out to Erika and Stephen for helping me bring this desk all the way from Chicago back to Madison.  I'm not too sure if my crappy car would have been sufficient transport.</p><p>While in Chicago yesterday, we made the mandatory stop at Mitsuwa.  I had never appreciated that place as much as i do now.  It's the midwest's little piece of Japan.  The stores are squished together like in Japan, the employees are polite like in Japan (though, they speak english to us westerners :/), and everything is in Japanese (w/ plenty of subtitles).  It's really the most Japanese i've been immersed in since returning to that states.  I love walking up to a restaurant and being able to read the menu.  ã?«ã??ä¸¼, ã¶ã£ã?ã?ã?ã©ã??, é³¥ã?«ã?¬ã?ã©ã??.  ^_^</p><p>I purchased several items in bulk, and called it a day.  There were plenty of kids from Anime Central hanging out as well.  Unfortunately, ACen neglected to have a saturday only pass available for purchase, or else i may have thought of considering going for a few hours.</p><p>Shade.</p><p>Wheeewww.

Whenever I open up a browser, I'm in my own little Googlized world.  My personalized homepage is complete with the current weather outside, quick submit links for ebay and wikipedia, quick links various websites, news feed from digg.com, and the Gmail gadget and Google Reader gadget.  When Firefox opens up, i've automatically checked my mail and all my RSS feeds.  It's pretty handy when you don't want extra programs running in the background.</p><p>Thanks to Google Reader, I now know that kotaku.com is FAR faster at getting video games news to the Internets than Jostiq.com, most of the time.<br/><br/>My personalized homepage is also pimpin' with the Japanese fox theme, even though i'm pretty sick of it now.  Google is also pretty handy on my phone, when I'm not at work or home.  My personalized homepage is just as easy to access, so i can still get my mail and my news.  Google Maps is pretty slick on my phone, too.</p><p>Speaking of which, Google Maps made some pretty slick upgrades recently.  Besides new Satellite photos, you can save your own 'maps' and easily import and export from Google Earth.   I made a <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1" title="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=107482720508825559944.0000011264c054eeddacc&z=13&om=1"> quick map of points</a> that those studying abroad might be interested in knowing ahead of time.  Just a couple basic areas.  I'll probably make another map that works with my <a href="/pages/games/lst/games2.html" title="/pages/games/lst/games2.html">Games List</a> a little better than my current solution.  These maps can be saved as a KML file, which loads directly into Google Earth.</p><p>If you haven't played around with Google Earth, it's free for download.  Just go to <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="http://earth.google.com/">earth.google.com</a>.  Google Earth is a 3 dimensional atlas of the world.  You start up far above the earth, and can zoom into anywhere you'd like.  The surface of the earth is skinned with the same Satellite images from Google Maps and works similarly.  When you get closer to the ground, the details of Earth become more clear..  The satellite images are high enough quality most of the time that you can see buildings, cars, and houses quite distinctly, just like Google Maps.</p><p>However, Google Earth can do far more than that.  Google Earth also renders terrain and buildings in 3D.  You can tilt the view to get a good grasp of what the area actually looks like.  Here's the Nagasaki area:</p><p>Google Earth streams all these images and information in real time, so it takes up very little space on you computer.  Though, it does load all its' cache into memory, which doesn't make it very light weight.</p><p>Google Earth also has links to Wikipedia, Google Earth communities, and  Panoramio: a community photograph repository.  People from around the world, can upload their photos and input coordinates on where their picture was taken.  Each month, Google grabs all the new information from Panoramio and hooks it into Google Earth.</p><p>Yesterday, i finally decided to make my own Panoramio account and start uploading photos.  I went through pictures #10000 through #17000 on my camera.  Basically, the time i was in Japan and the summer before hand.</p><p>Here's my account: http://www.panoramio.com/user/449013</p><p align="right" class="name"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/><p class="x"><font class="dat">April 25, 2007</font></p><p>Sometimes i get the feeling my life is a huge mess.  A gigantic pile of stuff that i own, but don't really want to deal with.  I like owning things.</p><p>One thing that was incredibly liberating about living in Japan for a while was my absence of stuff.  I left America with a suitcase filed with clothes, a laptop, my DS and games, and a couple personal items.  In Japan, i was free of all my worldly attachments as they were back on planet America.  Liberated.  Though, it was very reassuring that i hadn't lost anything.  A world away, my huge pile of stuff still sat there.  Still mine.  There was, maybe, once or twice that i wished i had a movie of mine with me in Japan, but beyond that, it never brought me down that i didn't have my stuff.</p><p>Well, i suppose i did have my online 'Stuff' with me.  My blog, pictures, and tons of other crap.</p><p>Truthfully, i had really been doing this for years during college.  My parents house is home to my main pile of stuff, and i would leave it up in Minneapolis, as i lived down in Platteville.  Throughout that time, i would acquire some new things and every one in a while, I would add these new things to my gigantic pile of stuff in Minneapolis.  I was never in a position where i couldn't visit my stuff pile without great difficulty.</p><p>Throughout my time in Japan, i did acquire several new things.  I started growing a new pile of stuff, and forget about what i had at home.  When i got back home, all my stuff was in one place, yet again.  My game library was all together.  My books were there, comics, flyers, etc...</p><p>But how much does all this stuff weigh me down.  Why do i need issue 43 of Nintendo power?  Who do i need a Club flyer of Bad Boy Bill from 2003?  Why do i need all my CS notes from College?</p><p>These are really just piles of stuff, and the only reason i feel the need to own them is because of sentiment.  I got that issue of Nintendo Power in the mail in 1990, and used the maps inside to beat that Nintendo Game.  I got that flyer from The Quest or Vital Vinyl when i was there that Summer and probably took pictures.  I spent fruitless amounts of time copying those notes down because it was imperative for later use.  They are a part of my history, it's not necessarily that they are monetarily valuable.  It's like being the curator for my own personal library.</p><p>This stuff is primarily relics from the past, but i hold onto things for the future.  What if i or some friend wishes to play this game, or read this book, or watch this movie, or etc?  Then we can share in part of my past.</p><p align="right" class="name"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/><p class="x"><font class="dat">February 24, 2007</font></p><p>As I looked at my computer screen while working on little bugs in the system, flakes of snow began to billow in the sky.  A cold and soft blanket of what the night would be.  After buying some delicious groceries, the blanket thickened as visability dimmed.</p><p>The previous snowfall had already begun to melt from the warmth of the past few days.  the beautiful white hills sported patches of unsightly brown.</p><p>After making dinner, my roommates gathered their things.  They were to house sit for the weekend.  A virtual mansion out in the countryside.  The animals needed feeding, so this was their task.  They asked me to join them, and hell...  I wasn't going to stay behind alone.</p><p>Outside was whitening.  A new cover of snow with plenty more falling from the sky.  Inside the car we puttered along the highway far slower than the limit.  An hour later, we reached our destination in the white wilderness.  Our tracks were covered behind us.  Its as if there was nothing out there.  Like we traveled  into the heart of white darkness with a warm lonely mansion at its center.  We piled out of the car, and sought refuge inside.  The car disappeared in snow as we moved to the doorsteps.</p><p>Inside we could only see white snow cover.</p><p>whoooo.  party!  thank god we brought about 100 beers with.  we played cards and built a fire and fell asleep.</p><p>The morning came and white light crept into the room bit by bit.  It had stopped snowing at some point through the night, but it is forcasted to add another equal layer.</p><p>so, we're here..  in the white wilderness, feeding their animals and listening to the radio.</p><p>I wonder who's gonna go crazy with the axe first.</p><p>anywho..  I wrote this on my phone.. :O</p><p align="right" class="name"><font class="nam">-- Dyre</font></p><hr size="1" width="100%" align="center"/><p align="center" class="y"><font class="nam"><a href="/old/v5/archive/3">&lt; &lt;</a>
