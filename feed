This year’s main lecture was &lt;b&gt;The Features and Potential of Japanese Budo Culture&lt;/b&gt; given by Seiichi Takeuchi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;竹内&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;整一&lt;/span&gt;.  He is currently a professor at Kamakura Women’s University, and former professor of the University of Tokyo.  His field is the study of ethics and Japanese thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lecture was given in Japanese and translated into English by Alex Bennett, who is currently a professor at Kansai University and has written and translated many books on the Japanese Budo arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qkz7Dr0LdIt_c1uUzVlLqe0Un5KgBCNV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14si24DDGrQOgoATrPpZQr5yQqXh0iIHK" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was my 3rd time attending the seminar.  Every year I’m able to get amazing insights into budo martial arts and learn about their connection to Japanese psychology and culture.  I previously wrote about the main lecture from the first seminar I attended two years ago: &lt;a href="/the-cardinal-virtues-of-japan"&gt;March 4th, 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I felt the contents of the lecture did not match the title, but the main idea expressed in the lecture was another fascinating look at an explanation for Japanese culture.  The theme carried through the explanations and examples was that of &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;「おのずから」と「みずから」&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Takeuchi&lt;span class='ja'&gt;先生&lt;/span&gt; explained the cooperative duality of these two forces behind the decisions and actions of people in Japanese culture and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Onozukara&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;おのずから&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class='ja'&gt;自然の働く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mizukara&lt;/i&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;みずから&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class='ja'&gt;自分の能力&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s do &lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;, first.  &lt;i&gt;Mizukara&lt;/i&gt; is the effect from oneself.  It’s the idea that an action or decision you made came as a result of your own willpower.  &lt;i&gt;Onozukara&lt;/i&gt; is the workings of nature, the idea that there is an overwhelming force behind a decision or action that made or allowed it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mizukara&lt;/i&gt; is pretty easy to understand, but &lt;i&gt;Onozukara&lt;/i&gt; is much more ambiguous.  In western countries, &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt; could be similar to the will of god.  God is an outside influence, and people often thank God for giving them fortunes, or blame God for misfortunes.  This was brought up in a question after the lecture had finished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Japanese people, the idea of God is not a singular entity.  Takeuchi&lt;span class='ja'&gt;先生&lt;/span&gt; mentioned if you asked a Japanese person who they pray to when they pray, they would not have an answer.  They wouldn’t know.  The will of nature is a result of many different factors and moving parts within the world and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another example, another question was asked, "Did you decide to do this lecture? Or was it the will of nature?"  He replied that he did want to do lecture, but he was also asked by many people to do it.  The people he knew and the connections he’s made throughout his life knew his expertise that made him qualified to give a lecture on this subject.  In that way, there was a force that created the opportunity for him to accept.  So, this lecture was a result of the actions of both nature and self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the idea of &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt; is the force of everything around us.  It’s the connections we’ve made with people in our lives, the opportunities society gives us, and nature itself.  It is not, directly, "the will of God."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Example within Japanese Language&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two concepts aren’t something that is thought of on the surface level.  People aren’t consciously thinking about the will of themselves or nature when making decisions.  But there are examples within the Japanese language that build on this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main example given was &lt;b&gt;I am to be married&lt;/b&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;結婚することになった&lt;/span&gt;.  When people get married in Japan and they announce it to their family and friends, they use this phrase.  It’s very passive and reflects the idea of &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;.  Getting married is simply a matter of course.  It’s natural.  Additionally, the effect of getting married wasn’t just decided or caused between the two involved.  It was the culmination of the people around them and their families’ blessings and good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did mention later in the lecture that a lot of young people these days use a more affirmative phrase when speaking informally about marriage, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;結婚することにした&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;we’ve decided to get married&lt;/b&gt;.  The two getting married take responsibility for their marriage as opposed to passively excepting it as a matter of nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be any number of reasons for why this is becoming more popular.  Perhaps young people aren’t being taught more tradition methods of speaking than they were before.  Maybe people aren’t getting married as often as before, so they don’t hear the phrase enough.  Or perhaps, as English and the western world becomes more prevalent in Japan, people are becoming more direct and affirmative when expressing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Connections to Budo&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a practitioner of a budo martial arts, we also seek for our movements to become natural.  In the beginning, we chose to study a martial art of our own free will (&lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;).  We all have our reasons for wanting to do it, whether it be for health, for friends, for fun, or because it looks cool.  We start from ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There Japanese word &lt;span class='ja'&gt;習う&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;narau&lt;/i&gt; means "to learn", but literally, it means "to continually repeat things" and becoming accustomed to it.  As a result, over time, these actions become natural.  You no longer need to think to do them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Budo, we strive for this level of movement where the thought process is no longer a factor, and to become part of nature, the natural flow of life (&lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;).  When movements and actions are not performed naturally, they are not seen as being complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kyudo (archery), for example, when one reaches the level of complete mastery, the practitioner feels that the bow no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;The 3 points of Japanese Thought&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the balance of &lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt; is the concept of Japanese thought and 3 points that define it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;自然&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;shizen&lt;/i&gt; - nature&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;意気&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;iki&lt;/i&gt; - will power&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;諦念&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;teinen&lt;/i&gt; - resignation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of &lt;b&gt;nature&lt;/b&gt; leads to accidental fury that was must put up with.  It’s something that we must endure and grow from.  &lt;b&gt;Will power&lt;/b&gt; is the willingness to put your body on line for what may happen.  And if something goes wrong, it’s your responsibility to &lt;b&gt;resign&lt;/b&gt; yourself to the outcome, and not make excuses for the result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though, resignation does not mean to simply give up.  It’s about reconciling the efforts of one’s will with the movement of nature, and to be able to see something clearly for what it is.  And in some cases, recognize your powerlessness to deal with whatever comes.  We take for granted our power over nature and often think that we can overcome it, but in reality we cannot.  Nature is a much greater force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;申し訳ない&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;moushi wakenai&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This phrase literally translates to "there were no reasons behind my actions" or "there is no verbal excuse for what I have done."  This is used as a strong apology in Japanese, but an actual apology means to explain your actions and why you were wrong.  This goes one step further by saying there can be no excuse for the action I’ve done.  In this way, you’ve accepted the outcome (resigned) and take full responsibility (will power).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;すみません&lt;/span&gt; &lt;i&gt;sumimasen&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is used as a light apology and basically means &lt;b&gt;excuse me&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;sorry&lt;/b&gt;, but the direct and complete translation is something closer to "my actions were not clear or clean or complete," or "I wasn’t able to completely do this action myself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Other Japanese Words&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the lecture on the cardinal virtues of Japan, speaker Seiichi Takeuchi wrote several books on the subject of &lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;.  He wrote 4 books, actually.  3 of which are out-of-print and expensive!  On Amazon, they are being sold for nearly 7000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;.  But, there was one book I could buy for only 500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QxsUo-FzLcdJABzLKDwiUVNpwp_yaZs5"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tGlVlvR5HrQPmrJ7ZLMIuOIi5RwR-5aq" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;「おのずから」と「みずから」のあわいで&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;やまと言葉で&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;哲学する&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;i&gt;onozukara to mizukara no awai de yamato-kotoba de tetsugaku-suru&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;i&gt;Awai&lt;/i&gt; isn’t so easy to translate, but I was told, in this context, that it basically means between.  Takeuchi&lt;span class='ja'&gt;先生&lt;/span&gt; talked about this balance between both &lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt; in his lecture, so I think it makes sense.  &lt;i&gt;Yamato-kotoba&lt;/i&gt; basically means words (&lt;i&gt;kotoba&lt;/i&gt;) that encompass the spirit of Japan (&lt;i&gt;yamato&lt;/i&gt;).  And lastly, &lt;i&gt;tetsugaku&lt;/i&gt; is philosophy.  So, the title is basically &lt;b&gt;The Philosophy of Japanese Words and Their Existence Between the Balance of &lt;i&gt;Onozukara&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Mizukara&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book starts off with a quick summary and definition for &lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;, and then has chapter on specific Japanese words, phrases, or expressions, their history, and their connection to &lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15O--vfjvvxTUILT3ud41EMwJL4zKpuTD"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nviBkuSfALzyaI8H-lfMf_MTc3U862kR" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ありがたい&lt;/span&gt; (thanks), &lt;span class='ja'&gt;めでたい&lt;/span&gt; (congratulations), &lt;span class='ja'&gt;あう&lt;/span&gt; (when meeting someone), &lt;span class='ja'&gt;あいする&lt;/span&gt; (loving someone), and so forth.  Maybe in the future, I’ll try and go through some of these chapters and write something about them.  For many people, though, Japanese philosophy is an incredibly dense topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Relation to Myself&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1vatrNiCsgOmRwnn3vtQTS-EC-BD_hQD0"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14f_ebtjeh6vlsqM3467R6HhCVaV8BCGC" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Lecture Abstract&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese will often say things like &lt;i&gt;kekkon suru koto ni natta&lt;/i&gt; (I am to be married) or &lt;i&gt;shuushoku suru koto ni natta&lt;/i&gt; (I am to start work).  It should be expressed as "I decided to …"  Even if something is decided by the will of the individual (&lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;), it is expressed as something that has been predetermined for him or her as a matter of course (&lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;).  This in turn indicates a tendency to accept things in one’s life and the world as being naturally preordained and to be accepted passively.  The Japanese philosophers Kuki Shuuzou identified three elements in the features of Japanese thought: "nature" (&lt;i&gt;shizen&lt;/i&gt;), "chic" (&lt;i&gt;iki&lt;/i&gt;), and "resignation" (&lt;i&gt;teinen&lt;/i&gt;).  This means that based on "natural" (&lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;) conduct, when something occurs the individual decides from one’s self (&lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;) to confront the situation putting their own body on the line (for example, seppuku) in the spirit of "chicness" (&lt;i&gt;iki&lt;/i&gt;), while also resigning (&lt;i&gt;teinen&lt;/i&gt;) the self to go with the natural flow (&lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;).  The culture of Japanese thought is considered within the encounter between the movement of nature (&lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;) and exertion of the self (&lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese budo culture is the same.  According to Kuki, "The ideas of Japanese morality maintain a significant meaning in universal nature (of &lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;)…  Morality which must reach the stage of becoming 'natural' cannot be seen as complete."  The term "morality" (&lt;i&gt;doutoku&lt;/i&gt;) can be replaced by the word "budo" here.  In bud, first engaging in rigorous training or study from your own volition (&lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;), if it does not ultimately become an inevitably natural (&lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;) activity then it "cannot be seen as complete."  To "&lt;i&gt;narau&lt;/i&gt;" (learn) means "to continually repeat things" thereby gradually becoming accustomed (&lt;i&gt;nare&lt;/i&gt;) to it, and "reaching the stage where it is natural."  In the culture of Japanese bud, there are correlations with moral, religious, and artistic thought in that one’s own efforts (&lt;i&gt;mizukara&lt;/i&gt;) will finally proliferate into and connect with natural expansiveness and depth (&lt;i&gt;onozukara&lt;/i&gt;).  Seen in this way, the features and potential become apparent.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/the-features-and-potential-of-japanese-budo-culture</link></item><item><title>Funayama 船山 in Winter</title><description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time in a while, I had a day off with no plans at all.  I woke up around 6:15am, as usual, and looked out the window to see a beautiful site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1i74fuBKlhEyfQOVWS_PaMLjQUAfUdGjY"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ONvLmAOR1FTiy2NRGtXhRbc2yg-uw5fk" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Norikura looked gorgeous.  The sky was quite clear.  And the sun was just below the true horizon about the rise.  I decided to grab my coat, put on my shoes, get in my car, and drive south to Funayama to catch one of the most fantastic views in Takayama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went to Funayama about a year and a half ago (&lt;a href="/funayama"&gt;November 5th, 2016&lt;/a&gt;) and it was incredibly easy.  Because of the cell reception station and towers at the top of the mountain, there’s a paved road that goes all the way up.  And because of those buildings, I assumed the entire way would be plowed for easy access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I was half right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1usla0Qm7sv5a9A0bXLSkSHScDuPs8Mxi"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SlMRgK40Z8Y560lgaM368Xgmu0TEpzQj" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast" &gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1XXSu9RqxNPIB0glThPMafO_CIqelRglH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EoxWtymi4fnU1CEfQmf_2W5AJGQzwhmn" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road leading to the top was plowed up to the cabins.  The sign near the fork of the road said it was another 2 km before reaching the top.  I thought, "that’s not that far.  I can run that in about 15 minutes."  Though, that would be on a flat course with no snow and ice.  I parked my car and started going up the path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snow had hardened since it had fallen over a month ago.  With each step, I had to dig my boot into the snow to keep traction and move forward.  It wasn’t hard.  Just annoying.  If I had remembered to bring my snowshoes, I could have doubled my pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1HLgSuhP8w9o8N5DkWEkubFFD90oj8rD9"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1olreQTKrAiaUHVdAIZNFxDrJQwN-Tulb" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast" &gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=11f6gg-VJHw4UMy179lrE8noyCVe8Qzu7"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1z7jDrA1OST8XvSEiUg-7YZ6AHNeW2UgR" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me about 15 minutes to travel half a kilometer, and that’s when I reached a fork in the road.  The road was in the process of being plowed, but it was still too slippery for my car.  It was still too slippery for my boots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road curved around back and forth to make up the vertical distance without being too steep.  With each turn, a small building through the trees became more and more visible.  When I moved around the last turn, it was in clear site, as was the edge of the hill it sat on top.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1PLGirsYoHGZ2AoHvljrFRoBjZdLeQsr5"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=15xM9t0LWWeHfO3CrqDoCTDbHip8eCUME" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast" &gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LCcMNUnMwCe_N7bnwL-uyz7qrNdMLdHl"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1qukXS57m2PqnlmInrjXuStHcyKkORZzE" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1RT1wh7JfQvwox1uskvGwQS5roYZbYQ0p"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1GiGbgocWPtdhBp_hWi2T4gMqnDuVw3_5" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the top of the Arkopia ski hill on the Takayama-facing side of Funayama.  From the top of the hill, Mt. Ontake, Mr. Norikura, and the Mt.

It would’ve taken me another hour to drudge up through the snow and take more photos of the view I already had in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took several pictures from where I was, but then headed back down to my car.  Most of the trip was sliding down the road using the flat trends of my boots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=14gKN4BsnYoUo5c4JKHr-r1gqgO4p4V2q"&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1LD4ouWIYM2vSdvSNuAaKUD7bVd7tdePt" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ever get the chance, whether it be summer or winter, Funayama offers one of the best views in the whole region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Timeline&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7:09am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;by car &lt;span class='ja'&gt;車&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Camp Site &lt;span class='ja'&gt;キャンプ場所&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.026147, 137.253332"&gt;36°01'34.1"N 137°15'12.0"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7:22am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Road Fork &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.026979, 137.249255"&gt;36°01'37.1"N 137°14'57.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7:36am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Arkopia Peak &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.027811, 137.246809"&gt;36°01'40.1"N 137°14'48.5"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7:49am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Left Arkopia Peak &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.027811, 137.246809"&gt;36°01'40.1"N 137°14'48.5"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8:01am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Road Fork &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.026979, 137.249255"&gt;36°01'37.1"N 137°14'57.3"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8:13am&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;walking &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩く&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Camp Site &lt;span class='ja'&gt;キャンプ場所&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href="http://google.com/maps/place/36.026147, 137.253332"&gt;36°01'34.1"N 137°15'12.0"E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/funayama-in-winter</link></item><item><title>Blade Runner 2049</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Blade Runner 2049 was a very overwhelming film when I saw it the first time.  A lot of that came from the sound, music, and visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sound and music are very loud and unnerving.  It helps describe the enormity of the future and density of the city.  Much of the music drips of wet industry.  Loud sprawling flanges in wide shots.  Silence and subtle tones in movement.  The technology of the future feels organic and grown out of past that incorporated the technology into itself, rather than began anew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The art design compliments the music well.  The future iterates on the future shown 30 years ago in the original Blade Runner.  Displays are blocky monitors rather than flashy holograms.  Communication is done through these displays, rather than a smartphone-like device that keeps constant communication between people.  The future also feels organic and lived-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Replicants in Blade Runner&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The premise of Blade Runner is that a corporation has developed technology to essentially manufacture people.  Replicants are not mechanical robots or cyborgs or something like that.  They are a completely organic manufactured person.  Designed to be less emotional and strong, they are mainly used off-world as a physical workforce or soldiers or whatever dirty-work humans don’t want to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first film, replicants are Nexus-6 models made by the Tyrell Corporation and are illegal to bring to earth.  Blade Runners are a section of the police force to capture or take out rogue replicants that somehow get to earth.  The main plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard, a blade runner, as he tracks down 4 rogue Nexus-6 models that have come to Los Angeles.  One significant aspect of the Nexus-6 model is their 4 year lifespan, which was used as a security deterrent if they were ever lost or escaped.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secondary plot of Blade Runner follows Deckard’s relationship with Rachael, who is a prototype Nexus-7 model.  She was given memories and believes herself to be human.  The memories define her as a person, and as such cannot be easily detected as a replicant.  They’ve removed the lifespan limit as well.  The film also famously toys with the idea of whether or not Deckard himself is a Nexus-7 model, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the events of Blade Runner, the Nexus-6 models were deemed too unstable or uncontrollable for continued use, and Nexus-7 models never went to manufacturing and their designs lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Replicants in Blade Runner 2049&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nexus-8 models were quickly developed by the Tyrell Corporation and sent to market.  Models had registration numbers imprinted on their eyes, and records of all models were kept in a central database.  Replicants were easy to tell apart from humans.  But the public rejected them because of how violent and problematic the Nexus-6 models were.  Many models were hunted down and killed in the streets on Earth.  This led to the events described in the short film, Blackout 2022.  Two replicants successfully destroy the database and detonate an EMP above Los Angeles to erase all records of Nexus-8 models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that point on, replicants became strictly illegal.  All surviving Nexus-6 models died naturally.  Nexus-8 models went into hiding.  The Tyrell Corporation went out of business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next decade, the infrastructure of Earth begins to deteriorate with the loss of the replicant workforce.  There are not enough people to sustain the ecosystem.  Niander Wallace of the Wallace Corporation buys the Tyrell Corporation and begins developing the Nexus-9 model of replicants.  These models are have the same feature of the Nexus-8 models, but designed to be absolutely loyal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short film, Nexus Dawn 2036, Niander Wallace brings his new Nexus-9 model before congress, states his claim that humanity needs replicants and that the replicant-ban be revoked, and then demonstrates their obedience.  Congress moves to revoke the ban, allowing Wallace to mass-produce Nexus-9 replicants and help rebuild the Earth’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Blade Runner 2049, the main character is a Nexus-9 replicant, KD6-3.7, or "K" for short, played by Ryan Gosling.  He works for the LAPD as a Blade Runner tracking down remaining Nexus-8 models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Cells Interlinked&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify K’s operational stability, he is subject to a baseline recalibration test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1SLovz2o5Phetg0pJQauOJMJ0t1tKz4uC" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test asks him a series of questions followed by a word of phrase he is meant to repeat.  The replicant is not meant to think or respond to the question, only the subsequent phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite parts of the film is how K’s obedience gradually and subtly erodes over time.  Much like the test, within his police work, he is meant to avoid or deflect questions while getting answers.  Within his investigation and daily life, every question is a test.  In the beginning, he doesn’t waver.  Sapper asks him questions.  He ignored them.  Luv asks him questions.  He deflects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides answering to his boss, played by Robin Wright, it’s only when Mackenzie Davis asks him a question, "What’s this?"  "A tree," that he responds directly to someone else’s question.  The first failure of the baseline test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1WdYSwpyXeLnYcV051SB0DVjZNe29MdeE" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, he speaks with Robin Wright about the case and she asks him a direct question of the case, "What do these numbers mean?" or "Do these numbers mean anything to you?"  He replies, "No."  A lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As K continues to investigate the whereabouts of a replicant born into this world, rather than manufactured, and as he starts to believe that he is that child, he starts to question his obedience and loyalty.  In following scenes, his stern emotionless face begins to crack under the weight of his feelings.  Through his blank face, we can feel his sadness, frustration, and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blade Runner 2049 follows K’s transformation from a mindless "robot" into someone fighting for himself and others and what he believes is the right course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Imagery&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the movie centers on K and his lack of emotion, so many scenes feel sterile and emotionally distant even though they are gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went through the film and picked out many images that shows the beauty of Blade Runner 2049’s art direction in set design, costume design, and visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1EQ-pChFng9QoNMOrl92WDrpdoG8Nfo-Y" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1-SiRkjHUCsZQCRiTyxYmm3WDtIBfHIRs" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1KaT6VnJ9BqzKn7hsWQkUE838w-_1ny75" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?id=19-ThonNp_znjBEivB3tVFjpfDTYPyNMO" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;Denis Villeneuve&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Blade Runner 2049 was definitely my favorite film of 2017.  It was directed by Denis Villeneuve, who directed my favorite film of 2016, too, &lt;a href="/arrival"&gt;Arrival&lt;/a&gt;.  Both movies were continuations and adaptations of previous works, but had a voice of their own, presented with a tense atmospheric soundtrack and beautiful visuals that engaged me completely.  I haven’t really seen any of his other films, but I’m definitely going to pay attention to whatever he does next.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>http://theschlock.com/blade-runner-2049</link></item></channel></rss>
