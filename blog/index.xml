This goes in line with the NES replica released a few years ago, and a few other attempts at nostalic video game replicas, like the Atari 2600 and the Pac-man Arcade unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was initially turned off by this announcement. I don't have a lot of nostalgia for the original Gameboy. And, while building Lego models is always fun, these larger models are expensive, take up space, and in this case, it doesn't really match the other Lego models on my shelf. It's a 60$ shelf piece, and that money would be better spent on actual video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I changed my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1544_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price on the set came down leading into Black Friday. It actually does kinda fit with my botanical decour since it is another life-sized model. And Natalie the Nerd announced that she was making a conversion kit to turn the Lego model into an actual working Gameboy. Because of the Analogue Pocket, I don't need a working Gameboy, but the idea of putting it together sounds really interesting. I want to try it, even though it will be expensive and I'll never use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I bought the model. And I bought a light kit, going further away from my excuse of the cost. I also bought a few other things to make another modification on the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Build&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building the Lego Gameboy is an incredible experience. So many of the components fit together sideways, backwards, and upside-down to create enough space inside the model for the buttons and D-pad to work, as well as match the near exact dimension of a real Gameboy. Various blocks also represent the PCB and other electrical internal components covered by the outer shell in the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1144_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1169_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So much care is put into the building experience. I think its easy to look at a Lego model and judge it based on its appearance, but there is often so much more to a Lego model. Putting it together can often show how much care the designer took in their planning and understanding of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, being able to hold the Lego Gameboy, touch the buttons, and play with it adds so much to the model. It's not as heavy as the original, and the studs on the D-pad are terrible, but after an incredible building experience, it feels like you've created something complete and workable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being to go a step further in the future to make it actually workable will bring further life to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1263_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does its best to match the dimensions and size of the original Gameboy, it still looks like Lego in the end from all the seams. Unfortunately, there's no real way to fix any of this. And really, the design team already did their best to hide as many seams as possible. This set includes several new pieces and new colored pieces to make it as lifelike as possible. If you think they should have done more, may as well just buy a replacement shell at that point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Buttons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the new colored pieces were used for the buttons. It is a mini-figure hat element recolored in magenta. Since I've been doing a bunch of console modding recently, I wanted to try the buttons in different colors, and there's only one other color available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1268_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is Kingsley Shacklebolt from Series 2 of the Harry Potter mini-figure series. Perhaps, it is an unremarkable figure of someone I have never heard of. Was he in the main series? Or Fantastic Beasts? Anyways, the Lego Gameboy buttons are a recolored version of his hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took apart the model a little bit, and installed the blue buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1279_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks okay. They feel and operate much smoother than the magenta buttons for some reason, but the look is off. As much as I wanted to make my Lego Gameboy unique, the colors make it look like a knockoff. It kinda looks like a Watara Supervision. So, I put the magenta buttons back in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Lego is being able to customize your builds however you like. Unfortunately, because so many of these pieces are unique and have unique prints on them, this is really the best you can do. You could also change the D-pad to a different color and use black start and select buttons, but I don't think any of those would improve the model. If they release a cross piece without studs, that would be an excellent upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because playing around with the buttons felt way better, when Natalie releases her conversion kit, I may end up using one or both of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Lights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aliexpress had a Lego Gameboy light kit for $3! Although that price was for new members only. The actual price ended up being 1700&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. A bit expensive for a few LEDs, but I thought that I could use the light later with Natalie's LCD screen. (probably not)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1289_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kit came with some Legos to modify the stands and a few raw LEDs. It also came with no instructions. You are meant to go to YouTube and watch a video of someone putting it together. &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g" title="https://youtube.com/watch?v=kq-DwuuGX9g"&gt;This is the video.&lt;/a&gt; It is often difficult to see exactly what it going on because of the black pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing the screen LED is easy, though. You just open up a path along the back and stick the LED strip along the base of the screen behind the inlay. You replace the holding bar with a small pipe piece which I think holds the inlay in place much better anyway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can barely see the pipe's shadow in the upper right corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screen LED was the whole reason I bought the kit, but I decided to put together the stand LED lights, too. Unfortunately, these tiny LEDs are very brittle. I was able to install two of them easily, but &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1319.jpg"&gt;I destroyed one of them&lt;/a&gt; crimping the piece the wrong way. With a very tiny pair of wire strippers, this could be fixed, but I will ignore it for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two out of three lights still allows me to create the modifications to the Gameboy's stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1359_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this light kit looks exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Lego Gameboy is meant as a display piece so it makes sense to have museum style spotlights on it. The screen LED also has a consistent level orange tone that makes it look like a classic screen light, too. Either Mario and Zelda inlays look great with this mod, but I prefer Zelda. The standard Nintendo scroll doesn't look like great, in my opinion. Tetris would've been best, but getting that license would've been more difficult and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going further, I used some leftover Lego LEDs from my bonsai trees and connected all the USB plugs together to set the Lego Gameboy among my Lego botanical collection. It works as the perfect center piece and the lights really emphasize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251130_lego_gameboy/IMG_1489_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should get some more Lego spotlights for the rest of the scene. (No no, stop spending money.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Incredible&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I'm very adverse to buying more Legos because of the price, the Lego Gameboy exceeds all of my expectations. I felt such incredible joy and accomplishment putting together the model, even though it's ultimately just a display piece (for now).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of Lego, 60$ really isn't all that much compared to so many other overpriced sets. Even the new Japanese Bonsai sets are way too expensive. However, considering that I could spend that same 60$ (or less) on Death Stranding 2, Assassin's Creed Shadows, or Ghosts of Yotei, it seems so foolish to buy this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I think its an incredible model that was a joy to build, looks authentic, and could become more special in the future thanks to Natalie the Nerd. If you're into video game collectibles, especially Nintendo, I think it's worth a purchase even if you don't care too much about the Gameboy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 27 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/lego-gameboy</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/lego-gameboy</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category>Toys</category><category>Media</category></item><item><title>Analogue Pocket Button Replacement</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Analogue Pocket is one of my favorite pieces of video game hardware ever. Decades of video game history have never looked, sounded, and felt better when played on this beautiful device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Analogue Pocket lends itself well to people wanting to customize their gaming experience both inside and outside of the platform. One of the first mods people did with their Pockets was a button swap. After the release of the Pocket and the opening of its FPGA, popularity exploded and many Etsy sellers got to work making their own buttons. I bought two different sets of replacement buttons back in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0608_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0611_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first set was from a seller on eBay who no longer exists. This was recommended by a user on the FPGA discord. The buttons followed the convex concave pattern of an SNES controller, but are made from soft resin. The D-pad is ever so slightly enlarged to prevent wiggling in the Pocket's shell. Because of this, the D-pad and buttons felt so much better than the original ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second set was from an Etsy store called Cloud Life, which also no longer exists. This store had a lot of different colors available, but I wanted something subtle, yet different. I didn't want any flashy gaudy colors as that would take away from the Pocket's sleek aesthetics. They also accepted custom orders, so I decided to use the Black button set as a base and add two transparent buttons for Y and B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting everything in Winter 2023 during a trip back to America, I finally did a button swap using the Cloud Life set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0623_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buttons looked really nice, but there were problems in other areas. First, the menu buttons had the wrong grooves. They sent two right buttons, instead of a right and left. Also, the bottom nub on the D-pad was flat, not rounded. This meant that it would usually not register rolling movements on the D-pad. If I pressed down, then right, it would stay down. So, I only did the button replacement, shown above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;NES D-pad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, someone else on the FPGA discord mentioned something interesting. Apparently the NES D-pad on those Nintendo replica Controller Capsule toys is an exact fit for the Analogue pocket. I bought &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/nintendo-controller-button-set" title="https://theschlock.com/nintendo-controller-button-set"&gt;a bunch of these last year&lt;/a&gt; when they released the second series focusing on Super Nintendo, Gamecube, and N64. I didn't care about the NES and Famicom ones, but I wanted to give this a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Auctions had a cheap enough one. It can easily be taken apart with a Phillips head screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0603_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0638_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user claimed that this D-pad felt so good when playing games. It also fixed his unfortunate problem of triggering false diagonals, a common problem among some Pocket owners. I never had this problem with my Pocket. My only problem was using that Cloud Life replacement D-pad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at each of these D-pad, you can see where these problems could occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0647_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grey D-pad is a near exact resin mold of the original D-pad. The nub in the middle is rounded, allowing for smooth diagonal movements. The stock D-pad had the same shape. The Cloud Life D-pad on the far right also has this nub, but it is not rounded. This does not allow for smooth diagonal movements, which causes some directions to become locked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NES D-pad looks like the best for rounded movements. It uses a stiff plastic post with a rounded ball in the middle. There are no grooves at all for diagonal movements to get stuck. This is why the NES D-pad felt the better than the stock D-pad for that user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I got to work tearing down my Pocket to install the NES D-pad as its nub's shape was clearly the best out of all my options. There's a great guide on ifixit showing &lt;a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396" title="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Analogue+Pocket+Buttons+Replacement/163396"&gt;full teardown and button replacement&lt;/a&gt; that I always refer to when opening my Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main tool you'll need a T6 screwdriver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0655_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are only five screws you'll need to remove. Four of them are immediately on the back panel of the Pocket, which is the first step of the teardown. You remove those screws and the back panel comes loose. This reveals the battery pack. Unplug the battery, and then remove it from the tabs on the side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a Gen 1 first release Pocket. Later models have slightly different batteries, but the process is the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0662_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before going further, we need to remove the PCB for the shoulder button contacts. There's a tiny plastic tab holding it in place. Pull that back with some tweezers and the board should come loose. Next, we want to &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0665.jpg"&gt;remove the ribbon cable&lt;/a&gt;. Just pop open the gate, and the ribbon can be pulled out. (This is annoying to put back in later.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the back panel is only clipped into place. To remove it, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0666.jpg"&gt;slightly lift the bottom end of it&lt;/a&gt;, and then slide it down. The clips will let go of it, and you can remove it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0673_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the back of the Pocket's main PCB. There are four points of contact now. The cables going to the top two speakers must be unplugged. Just open those gates, and pull out the cables. There's another cable going to the power button. Open that gate, and remove the cable. And, the final screw in the middle, which holds the PCB to the front shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCB can be lifted from the shell, but there is still a cable from PCB to the front screen. The ifixit instructions say to remove the plug to completely detach the front shell, but I am too nervous to do this step. It's probably completely safe, but I'm too worried about damage. I can reach the buttons easily without having to unplug it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remove my D-pad and put in the NES D-pad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0685_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I don't like how it looks. The plastic sheen of the NES D-pad doesn't match the matte finish of the Pocket, nor the softness of the Cloud Life buttons. It looks really out of place. Also, the arrows on the D-pad also don't match the Pocket's aesthetics. It's too busy compared with the subtleness of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main purpose of doing a button replacement is for the presentation. All of the stock components already felt amazing and played great, so I didn't need to do anything if I only cared about usage. Also, the NES D-pad is slightly smaller than the original one. So, it wiggled around even more than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0692_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user on the FPGA discord was using the D-pad on a White Pocket, so the aesthetics are a bit different. On the Black Pocket, it's too easy to compare black to black and see that things are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cloud Life D-Pad&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like the aesthetics of the Cloud Life D-pad the best, but its square nub prevented the movements. Well...  what if I used a nail file to round it out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0695_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0698_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material they used for these buttons melted away almost immediately, and I could create the rounded movement that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0703_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's more square than the original D-pad, but it fits the aesthetics and matches the buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The material that they used for these buttons is weirdly refractive. Depending on how the light enters the button, the weave of the material either brightens or darkens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0729_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see this with the X and A buttons on the side. The weave of the X button is horizontal, while the weave of the A button is vertical. With the direction that I installed the D-pad, too much light is reflected. I need to open it up again and change the rotation to make it perfect. :/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Buttons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Pocket-mania has really died down. Developers are still putting out some Arcade cores, but Analogue has been focusing their efforts on their Nintendo 64, and not really given much time to the Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do occasionally play the Pocket from time to time. I'll run through a game of Dr. Mario, and see how far I can get in Gradius III or Outrun. Sometimes I'll devote a little time for a good run in Tetris Rosy Retrospective, too. Maybe someday, I'll try to get all the way through Snatcher on Turbo CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251117_pocket_buttons/IMG_0773_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite having the boring Black version of the Pocket, I really love how it looks, how it plays, and how it feels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-button-replacement</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-button-replacement</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>8bitdo Pro 3 Controller and Shiny Hunts</title><description>&lt;p&gt;I bought yet another retro controller. The Pro3 is 8BitDo's latest revision of one of their most popular controller, the SN30, which was based on the Super Nintendo controller. It comes in a few different colors, half of which are based on the Gamecube. I decided on going with the mid to dark gray tone of the original Playstation because I think this looked best when paired with the Super Famicom buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9500_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Pro3's roots are in the retro space, it is very much a modern controller. I think it's interesting how third-party controllers used to be cheap knock-offs, but in the last 5 or 10 years, many gaming peripheral companies are creating controllers that can do more and work better than first-party controllers. They use more precise components that don't degrade over time and still sell them for cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Switch is the best example of this. Switch Joy-Cons are now infamous for developing "drift," sending unintended movements when you're trying to play. Switch Pro controllers also can develop drift, as well as Xbox and Playstation controllers. Modern premium third-party controllers use "hall-effect" style sticks that prevent this drift from happening, including the Pro3 controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9578_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it's also interesting how the evolution of 8BitDo's Pro series somewhat mirrors their own development as a company. 8BitDo began as a company selling NES and SNES controllers that worked on original hardware and modern PCs. The SN30 was released in 2018 and the SN30 Pro came a year later, which added the twin sticks. In 2021, they released the Pro2 which aimed to make the controller more modern with ergonomic handles and programmable buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their controllers became more and more modern, 8BitDo was expanding their focus from retro only to all modern platforms. In 2022, they released the Ultimate 1, their first controller that primarily targetted modern gaming. Now in 2025, they have brought all the features of their Ultimate controller series back to the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9595_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, I did not care about the Pro3. While I love the Super Nintendo, it's flat-face design puts too much emphasis on nostalgia instead of ergonomics and comfortability. I think the Playstation 5's Dual Sense is the most comfortable controller I've ever used. It fits in my hand perfectly, and all the buttons are close enough and in exact positions that I only have to move my thumb to press something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting the Pro3, it does feel big and combersome. When I'm gripping the controller and focused on using the sticks for movement, my hands are too down the handle that I need to move them to hit UP or the Y-button. And I really need to move my hand to hit the Start and Select button in the middle. Sure, that's their nostalgic position in the middle, but having those buttons in the corner of the D-pad and the button array is their modern, more convenient position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe they should've made some considerations to sacrifice nostalgia. Although, after using it nearly a whole day playing Pokemon on Switch, I didn't have any problems, so maybe my brain is too wired on the Dual Sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9487_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 comes with a charging dock and USB-C cable. The charging dock doubles as a wireless receiver as hidden in the base of the dock is a USB-C 2.4ghz dongle. You can remove this dongle and use it on a Mac or Windows or plug this directly into the Switch 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also hidden in the dock are replacement buttons. The face buttons on the Pro3 are held in place by magnets. You can remove these buttons using the plunger tool and mix-n-max the buttons in any order you want. You can keep the buttons to match the Switch B-A layout, or flip them to fit Windows' A-B layout. You can also replace them with the rainbow buttons matching the Super Famicom layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/IMG_9495_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I do like the Pro3 and it is a strict upgrade from using the Dual Shock 4, which I had been using on the Switch and other consoles prior. I like the Dual Shock 4 a lot, but mine is a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller" title="https://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller"&gt;custom repair job&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago. It feels rickety from the repair and once or twice the buttons don't work without a power cycle. It is also limited by its bluetooth connection, which requires a USB dongle for the switch. (I'm using the 8BitDo retro receiver.) And also the giant touch pad in the middle acts as the screenshot button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 feels solid and incredibly well made. Using bluetooth, it connects to the Switch natively without the need of a USB receiver, so it even works in handheld mode. You can go a step further and use the included 2.4ghz receiver, which gives a connection that makes the controller feel just as responsive as a wired connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pro3 has now become my universal controller used on Switch, Mister, and other consoles with Bluetooth options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pokemon Z-A Shiny Hunts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think having many extra buttons and back paddles on a controller is unnecessary, the biggest boon of the Pro3 is being able to program these buttons to perform macros. And this is particularly helpful with the most recent Pokemon game, Legends Z-A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all Pokemon games, you encounter, catch, and train Pokemon to be the best. However, when they spawn, every Pokemon has a base 1/4096 chance of becoming Shiny, an alternate colored version. These are highly sought after because of their rarity, even though they occasionally look terrible. In recent games, there have been methods which increase your chances of a shiny either through increased odds or increased spawns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legends Z-A has a different method through permanence. As you walk around Luminose City, Pokemon spawn and despawn from a 50m radius around your character. However, if a Pokemon spawns as a shiny, it will stay in memory. Even if it despawns, when it comes into view again, it will be shiny. This means that if your character is running around the world, it is constantly shiny checking Pokemon that will not disappear on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is perfect for the Pro3 because you can program infinitely repeating movements for your character as a macro, let the macro run by itself, and come back to the games hours later to find tons of shiny Pokemon (hopefully).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Macros and Mac Problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To set macros on the Pro3, you must use 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2. This software is available on ios, macos, pc, and android. You also use this software to update the firmware on the controller and dongle. On Mac, the current version is v1.0.8, but when you update the firmware on the dongle, the dongle becomes stuck in boot mode, so the controller cannot connect to it. (The problem doesn't happen on Windows.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent an email to 8BitDo's support and they replied with an updated version of the software for Mac. Version 1.0.8 is from Sept 2025, but this one has a date of Oct 2025. Maybe it's a prerelease version of 1.0.9? Anyways, here's a link if you happen to need it: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q0VS6KQ8GbIiVz6cMhGCAxgOnDm8oCk7/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs/ 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 for mac adapter boot.zip&lt;/a&gt;. Using this new version fixes my dongle's boot problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the controller is connected either through the dongle or a wired USB-C connection, you can click into its Switch settings and create a profile. Profiles can be switched on the fly, so you can set up 4 macros on one profile, and switch to another profile with another 4 macros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Mac, macros are built using controller inputs and refined after. You can't build them by scratch, which I think is possible on Windows. But, it's easier to just record input and mess with them after. Once a macro is built, it must be assigned to one of the 4 extra buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Froakie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Froakie, I used the following macro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/WildZone5n16_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froakie spawns in the middle of Wild Zone 16, which is unlocked after reaching Rank C in the story. This macro is meant to be started after entering Wild Zone 5, though, which is right next to it. After entering Wild Zone 5 from the south, you can fast travel to Wild Zone 5 which puts you right in front of the entrance you just entered. Fast traveling like this rerolls and respawns all Pokemon, so putting this on an infinite loop will do a Froakie check every 20 seconds. It will reroll all surrounding Pokemon, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FYI, these timers are based on Switch 1 load times. Switch 2 would be faster, so you could tweak the times to be more efficient. It's pretty efficient on my Switch 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After setting this up, I sat in my bathtub for about 2 hours. When I returned, I already had a shiny Froakie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920062200_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025110920145700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greninja is an excellent Shiny, plus it has a new Mega evolution. I thought he would be perfect for my team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Litwick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chandelure is another strong Pokemon whom also has a new Mega evolution. I'm not a fan of its Shiny, but rare is rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litwick spawns in only three locations, two of which are near each other and all of which are in the sewers. You first visit these sewers right before reaching Rank C in the story. After that story sequence, they are closed off, but can be opened again through a side mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For shiny checks, we want to run down the hallway leading to the Litwicks. After they spawn, we want to run back to the beginning of the hallway. Rinse and repeat to infinite. Here's my macro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/LitwickSewer_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was adapted from &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtvvjHf6XjoNOOor79sGWcAb-7cODfC4MxtP7dGHp2c/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABmop9o64*PyMj49AE9321GW2IhVd7fA#gid=1954077779" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vtvvjHf6XjoNOOor79sGWcAb-7cODfC4MxtP7dGHp2c/htmlview?usp=sharing&amp;pru=AAABmop9o64*PyMj49AE9321GW2IhVd7fA#gid=1954077779"&gt;PhillyBeatzU's Youtube Community&lt;/a&gt;. Each one of these I have had to tweak in some small way, so if you use any of these yourself, you might have to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This macro I left running all day while I went to work. I figured that I would return home to either my game being turned off because things went to sleep or ran out of batteries, or my character was stuck on the wall. Neither were the case, and I had two shiny Litwicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111018572800_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111221171300_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ralts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ralts ultimately evolves into Gardevoir and Gallade. Psychic and Fairy moves have been very helpful in Pokemon Z-A so far, so I thought Gardevoir would be a good addition to my team. Gallade is a great Pokemon when catching other because it knows Hypnosis and False Swipe. False Swipe isn't in Z-A, so I'm not sure if Gallade is actually useful, but it's Psychic and Fighting might be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, two Ralts spawn in the overworld in the northwest in a grassy alcove of buildings. When you go in the area, there's a ladder that brings to the roof, right next to a bench. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a bench, you can progress time from day to night and night to day. This respawns all Pokemon just like fast traveling, but you don't have to worry about the day-night cycle. Choose the bench closest to the ladder, and use the following macro:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench.png" title="https://theschlock.com/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/pokemon-za-shiny/Bench_s.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This macro was again adopted for PhillyBeatzU. It just holds down and hits the A button a bunch. There's a B button thrown in there in case it accidentally chooses to relax with Pokemon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left this going all day while I was at work and came back to nothing on the first day. Although, there was a shiny Dedenne and Flabebe on other roofs nearby. The next day, I left it going again and I came back to TWO shiny Ralts. There was an Eevee on a nearby roof, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219071000_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_8bitdo/2025111219114700_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both Ralts had Adament natures, which is bad for Gardevoir, so the search continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Pokemon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I'm working on building my shiny team for the game's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My next target is Delphox which has been instrumental in many of my fights. Chandelure and Gardevoir might replace its duties, but it's not a bad idea to have some redundancies. I need to progress to the story to Rank B to unlock the Wild Area that has Fennekin, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ground is another very useful type in Pokemon Z-A and Mega Garchomp is going to be the best Ground type. Hunting that one is very annoying, though, as it only has a 10% chance of spawning in its area. Apparently, you can do some spawn manipulation to get them spawning 100% of the time. I might take the time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my team would be Greninja, Gardevoir, Gallade, Delphox, Garchomp, and Chandelure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hmmm...  I don't really have any good defense against Fairy and Water. I need steel and grass moves. I guess I should go after Beldum when I reach that point in the story. For Grass, having a shiny Meganium would be best, but those won't be available until after the story is complete. I think Gallade might have a good Grass move...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pokemon Z-A&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shiny Hunting has been lucrative, but the passive brute force nature of it is not very engaging like it was in Legends Arceus or Pokemon Violet. Also, there is very little variety in the city and the low rez nature of the game makes it quite boring when compared with the open world games I've gone through this year on PS5. Katamari has more variety than this, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I cannot find myself caring about this story. It's neat to see old characters from Pokemon X/Y come back, but the story wasn't all that great back then either, so I don't remember it at all. The last Pokemon story that I actually remember was Pokemon Black/White where the villains thought the idea of "enslaving" Pokemon in balls was cruel, which was an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of voice acting in Pokemon is really becoming apparent now, too. Every cutscene is endless textboxes with uninspired music in the background. It's sometimes hard to stay awake, let alone pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part of the game is its new take on the battle system making it more of an arena fighter rather than a turn-by-turn RPG fighter. In my opinion, the most boring part of Pokemon has been fighting. It takes forever, and it's always just a means to an end. While not perfect, this arena-style battling is fresh and pretty fun. I would love to see this refined in future titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, I think that is the game's only good point. Good = Battling. Bad = Graphics, Art, Music, Story, Characters, Exploration, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I'll continue playing much after completing the story and completing the Pokedex. I don't think I will go deep with Shiny hunting the way I had with other titles. I think I'll probably move on to another game or buy that Assassin's Creed DLC.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-and-shiny-hunts</link><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category/><category>Pokemon</category></item><item><title>MemCard Pro for Gamecube</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Memory cards for video game consoles in the late 90s through 2000s were an absolute necessity as disc-based media replaced traditional cartridges. Consoles didn't have internal storage, so these cards held all your saves. It was great for moving your saves around to a friend's house or using multiple game consoles, but if you played a lot of games, you ended up having A LOT of memory cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were several third party solutions at the time that offered cards with increased capacity and multiple pages, but they weren't always supported and often weren't as stable as official solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With retro gaming being so popular, 8BitMods has created a modern day solution to this problem that is incredibly stable. Last year, after putting together a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;Playstation 2 set up&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2"&gt;MemCard Pro2&lt;/a&gt; was an essential part. It was one of the most incredible pieces of the set up as I was able to bring all my saves from 25 years ago into the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_4535_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the MemCard Pro2, the second version of the Memcard was created for the Gamecube, titled the &lt;b&gt;MemCard Pro GC&lt;/b&gt;. They are currently working on a fourth version of the Memcard for exclusive use on the Dreamcast, the VMU Pro. I can't wait for that. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MemCard GC has the same functionality of the PS2 version, complete with WiFi, online memory card page navigation, and Game ID recognition to create unique memory cards for each game. All game saves and information are stored on a micro SD card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I had planned on &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;modding my Gamecube with the FlippyDrive&lt;/a&gt;, I bought a MemCard Pro GC, which complemented my replacement shell quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard set up for the MemCard Pro GC is mostly the same as it is for the MemCard Pro2. I wrote about those &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; last year. However, transferring saves from old memory cards is a much different process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Micro SD Card&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Memcard, you'll need an SD card. So, how big did you need? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory cards for the Gamecube were released in 512kb, 2mb, and 8mb sizes. The 8mb card had 1019 blocks available for saves. Most games take up between 3 and 20 blocks, so even as the largest, the 8mb card could hold saves for 50 games. 1gb could hold 125 of those big 8mb memory cards, which would be enough for 6250 games on their own. So, 64gb could hold saves for how many games? 400,000. A number far higher than the number of games released on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;64gb is obviously overkill, but a 64gb micro SD card is less than $10 these days. If you don't have a smaller card lying around, it's not too expensive to get a new one. You'll never have to worry about space again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Firmware Set Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Memcard wants the SD card formatted in either FAT32 or ExFat. Either is okay, so I went with ExFat. I downloaded the &lt;a href="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public" title="https://distribution.appcake.co.uk/install/8bitmods/apps/memcard-pro-gc/public"&gt;Latest Firmware&lt;/a&gt; and copied the files onto the card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone recommended downloading a previous version and using the web interface to update it to the most recent version, but I had a lot of problems with that. Don't do that! Just download the most recent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;WiFi Set Up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the MemCard Pro is its web interface. Setting up WiFi allows you to change memory cards from the computer rather than hitting buttons on the device. You can also create new cards of various sizes, update firmware, and change around other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you initially insert the Memcard into the Gamecube and turn it on, the screen will ask you to set up WiFi. The Memcard is broadcasting now, and wants you to connect to its signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9383_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9390_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The SSID password is mcpadmin&lt;/b&gt;.

So, you cannot have JP saves sitting alongside NA saves on the same card. Often, the Gamecube will ask you reformat your card when you use it in the wrong region, which would erase all your saves. There aren't any options for the Memcard to set a region for the card. I think once a card is created, you have to manually format it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, some saves are copy protected! Phantasy Star Online, F-Zero GX, Pokemon Colosseum, Fire Emblem, and a few others won't allow you to copy saves using the Gamecube. Some of these are simple flags preventing the copy. However, PSO and F-Zero go a step further by locking the save to the serial number of the memory card. Even if you transferred the save, it would not function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you need some help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gamecube Memory Manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/suloku/gcmm/releases" title="https://github.com/suloku/gcmm/releases"&gt;Gamecube Memory Manager&lt;/a&gt;, or GCMM, is a homebrew application for the Gamecube, denoted by the &lt;code&gt;dol&lt;/code&gt; file extension. Using this program, you can easily move save files to an SD card and back to a different card. It is way faster than the Gamecube UI, plus you can move copy protected saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;To run this, you need a modded Gamecube&lt;/b&gt;. I don't think there's any way of burning this to a disc and having a retail unit run it without help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All homebrew apps work just like disc ISOs on modded Gamecubes, so stick the &lt;code&gt;dol&lt;/code&gt; file with your games, and boot up your Gamecube. Run the app, and you'll get this screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9452_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will complain about not having any FAT device connected, and it won't allow you to do any of the actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;My Gamecube is modded with the FlippyDrive&lt;/a&gt;, but I think PicoBoot and some others might have the same problem. The FlippyDrive is bypassing the Disc Reader to send data to the Gamecube. The disc reader is not a writeable storage device, so I cannot send my saves to the FlippyDrive. Not to mention my FlippyDrive's SD card is ExFat, not FAT32, which is what GCMM wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the MemCard Pro is only emulating standard cards. It is not a full storage expansion. Plus, that SD card is also ExFat, not FAT32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took me a little while to figure this out, but we need a physical FAT32 device to use as storage for our saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;SD2SP2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a device called the SD2SP2 for the Gamecube that acts as a FAT32 storage device for the Gamecube. It is widely available. I bought this one for 999&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; on Amazon with Next Day delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9287_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9288_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 ports on the bottom of the Gamecube. In practice, one port is used for the Gameboy Player, one port is used for the modem or broadband adapter, and the other port was never used. The unused port is called the Serial Port 2. It's possible developers used this for debugging retail Gamecubes, but its main purpose these days is being used for extra storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After assembling the pieces of the SD2SP2 together and putting in an SD card, it plugs in Serial Port 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9300_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really don't like how this looks. I guess it's supposed to make access to the SD card convenient, but the connection to the serial port isn't perfect. It feels like it will easily fall out. I would much rather have an earlier version that doesn't have the flat bottom, so I could use the port cover to lock it in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD Card must be formatted as FAT32, of course. Once everything is plugged in, GCMM immediately detected it on start up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9370.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9370.jpg"&gt;I did full raw backups of each of my memory cards.&lt;/a&gt; Only 5 memory cards this time compared with my mountain of 20+ cards on Playstation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9375_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And at this point, we're done with the SD2SP2. You don't need to use GCMM to restore backups on the MemCard Pro. And even so, it won't let you do full backups because the memory card serial numbers don't match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our next move is on the computer to make these backups workable on the Memcard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory Card Save Splitting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key features of the Memcard is using Game ID to automatically create and switch to a memory card devoted to a single game. Then, you never have to worry about save space. All of my original memory cards had saves from multiple games (as did all of ours), so we want to split all of these up. And we have a program to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bodgit created a command line &lt;a href="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro" title="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro"&gt;Memcard save splitting program&lt;/a&gt; to be used with Playstation 1 and Gamecube saves. Just download the latest release and stick it in the directory with your saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD2SP2 created backup files with the &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; file extension, and that's the same file extension used on the MemCard Pro, Dolphin, and all other Gamecube emulators. It's the standard Gamecube Memory Card file format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By running &lt;code&gt;split&lt;/code&gt; on our raws, we get individual cards for each game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9397_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the command in text:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;./memcardpro split [folder-name] [memory-card-name].raw&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games are separated into folders matching their Game IDs, which is how the MemCard Pro references game unique cards. Add all those folders in the &lt;code&gt;MemoryCards&lt;/code&gt; directory on your Memcard, and they will all be available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Success&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, I didn't have nearly as many saves as Playstation. Around 30 unique game saves on Gamecube compared to 53 on PS1 and 89 on PS2. But these saves are all pretty special, especially my old Animal Crossing save. Now I can view my house from 20-some years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9442_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9443_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9446_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9449_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to get 7 NES games back in the day! I don't remember how I did that. My mailbox was completely full, so I think all of my residents sent their goodbyes a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My F-Zero save is also in tact with all tracks unlocked, near complete story progress, all of my old records, all of my custom cars, and a few ghosts. To preserve the serial numbers, I think the save splitter just copies the source &lt;code&gt;raw&lt;/code&gt; and removes all the other game files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9409_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251109_memcard_gc/IMG_9405_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of my saves have been added to my &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/apps/ps2/gc/saves" title="https://theschlock.com/apps/ps2/gc/saves"&gt;Modded Console Inventory page&lt;/a&gt;, so you can download them and use them, if you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like the MemCard Pro2 on Playstation, this is the perfect companion to a modded console. You will never run out of space and memory cards will automatically be chosen when games are selected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm using &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive"&gt;FlippyDrive in my Gamecube&lt;/a&gt;, so there isn't a full guide explaining how to do all of this from start to finish. But, Archades Games on YouTube was a huge help. His videos on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0"&gt;backing up saves&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XsbLcGnQY0"&gt;save transfer guide&lt;/a&gt; pushed me in the right direction, along with his set up guides for the MemCard Pro2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many options for playing Gamecube games these days, but if you're still using original hardware, I think the MemCard Pro GC is your best option.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Modding the Gamecube with Flippy Drive</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Completing my collection of millenium modded Japanese consoles, I turn to the Gamecube. Overall, it was a solid piece of hardware that had a lot of interesting games and peripherals. There's not a whole lot of bad things you can say about it, except for a slight lack of games. Many publishers were still burnt from the N64 and didn't return. Also, the Playstation 2 was getting huge expansive RPGs that never appeared on this platform. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are several unique and incredible experiences that became exclusive to the Gamecube. Many of these were from Nintendo themselves, but Capcom, Namco, and Sega helped out. Animal Crossing, Pikmin, Monkey Ball, F-Zero GX, Viewtiful Joe, Baten Kaitos, Resident Evil series revival, Resident Evil 4, and two incredible Legend of Zelda games. Also, Square finally put Final Fantasy back on Nintendo with Crystal Chronicles. It seemed like the curse of the N64 may have been broken, but Playstation 2's shadow was too vast to escape from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have modded the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;Playstation 2&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast"&gt;Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt;, so I thought I would do the same with the Gamecube. And here it is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9358_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few hiccups along the way, but it works flawlessly and I'm able to use and manage my 20-year-old saves, too. The main hardware mod that drives my Gamecube is the FlippyDrive on the inside paired with a MemcardPro and the Bitfunx HDMI adapter on the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Parts List&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to the FlippyDrive from yet another one of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPq48Wm8y-U" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPq48Wm8y-U"&gt;Tito's MachoNacho videos&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. After completing my Playstation 2 set up, the idea of modding consoles no longer seemed impossible to me. The FlippyDrive was an internal mod, but it required no soldering and no damage to the original console. Plus, it was a disc reader bypass, so you could still use game discs as normal. Additionally, it was cheap at only $45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FlippyDrive was being funded through CrowdSupply and the campaign was still going at the time, so I purchased a deluxe kit on September 9th 2024. It eventually shipped almost exactly a year later on September 11th 2025. In preparation, I purchased several other things to complement the mod:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8949_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My full parts list is as follows:&lt;br/&gt;- FlippyDrive Deluxe Kit with Ethernet Adapter and Back Plate&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;a href="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension" title="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension"&gt;FlippyDrive SD Card Extension&lt;/a&gt; (from Laser Bear)&lt;br/&gt;- MemCardPro GC (from 8BitMods)&lt;br/&gt;- HDMI Adapter (from Bitfunx / Aliexpress)&lt;br/&gt;- Shell Replaement - Grape Translucent (from Aliexpress)&lt;br/&gt;- ...and later, I bought an SD2SP2 adapter from Amazon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using all components required &lt;b&gt;THREE&lt;/b&gt; SD cards. I'm using a 64gb for the MemCard, a 128gb for the SD2SP2, and a 512gb card for the FlippDrive to hold all the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set up for the MemCard Pro was a bit messier than I originally thought, so I have detailed that journey &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube"&gt;in a separate post&lt;/a&gt;. This post will focus on the Gamecube mods themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlippyDrive Software Preparation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive is a new mod for the Gamecube amongst a community of already established mods. Its selling point is ease of installation, a more native-looking UI, and a cheap price point. But because it is still so new, I had trouble finding information about how I should prepare the SD card. The Playstation 2 and Dreamcast had very esoteric file structures, so I assumed I had to do something weird here, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the case. You can keep the SD card in ExFat format, and just dump the Gamecube ISOs in the root directory. That's it. There's no specific naming format or folder structure. You can make folders if you want to organize some games, but that's unnecessary. Each Gamecube game is around 1.1gb or 1.4gb, so my 512gb SD card can hold everything I would ever want to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wiki has &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/usage.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/usage.html"&gt;some details about SD card prep&lt;/a&gt;, but it's really nothing. Just format the card as ExFat and put in the ISOs. &lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; it currently does not support RVZ files, which is the common Dolphin compressed format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gamecube Teardown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to installing the FlippyDrive, I will be replacing almost all of the outer shell with this Grape Translucent one. Here are all the parts included in the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8988_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It came with the screwdrivers required for the teardown, and so many many parts. This was way more parts than those included with the Dreamcast replacement kit. (Although, the Dreamcast kit already had the upper shell preassembled.) The box did not come with any instructions, but by following the teardown of the Gamecube, it's not difficult to figure out where everything goes and how things fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, with experience from the Dreamcast shell replacement, I made the decision to not completely replace everything. I wanted to keep the front gray controller plate, the Gamecube Logo plate on top, and maybe a few other things. I was already not going to use the back plate because I had &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8991.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8991.jpg"&gt;a replacement for the ethernet port&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gamecube shell is held together with only four hexagonal screws. They are removed with &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8992.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8992.jpg"&gt;the included orange-handled screw driver&lt;/a&gt;. These are the only weird screws in the console. All others are Phillips head screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_8995_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately, I decided to start work on the upper shell before continuing with the teardown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upper Shell Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there were no instructions, but it was easy to look at the factory assembled shell and figure out which pieces went where and how things fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9000_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9008.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9008.jpg"&gt;the black lid cover with the Gamecube logo&lt;/a&gt;, I decided that I wanted to use the black handle and the black vent cover in my build. I thought &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9007.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9007.jpg"&gt;the black handle looked very attractive&lt;/a&gt; with the shell rather than having the shell be a complete single color. Also, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9001.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9001.jpg"&gt;the vent cover included in the kit was terrible.&lt;/a&gt; The original cover had a mesh screen for preventing dust from entering. The new cover was just a plastic piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9013_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assembling the lid took some acrobatics with the springs. Actually, attaching the handle on first blocked some of the components, so I had to remove it before proceding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9015_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I figured out that the spring must be connected to its bracket and then fitted into the hole from the inside at the same time as the tray is being fitted from the outside. These two pieces need to connect to each other through the hole, and then the bracket needs to be screwed into place before it falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a while, but eventually it got in there and I could screw it down. Then the bracket on the other side slips into place, and becomes secure with a screw. Finally, the handle goes on over both parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9020_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9022_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lid latching mechanism was much less difficult to fit into place. When the Open Tray button is depressed, the mechanism rotates to release the tray, and the spring snaps it back into place. It is much stronger and fail-resistent compared with the Dreamcast lid hatching component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9025_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the new shell, I put the button in first and put the bracket on above it. I think you can do it in either order, though. For the bracket, I fit the spring into the raised side with part of the spring going through the hole. I pulled tension on the spring and fit it on the screw peg. The screw should not be screwed too tightly, as there needs to be enough freedom for the bracket to move back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My kit only came with one widened screw, but the component is so solid, that once the top screw is in place, it holds everything perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9054_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final pieces of the upper shell are the buttons. The Power and Reset buttons are easily snapped into their holes. I decided to take the gray Power button from the original console and reuse it. It can easily be removed &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9042.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9042.jpg"&gt;by pushing the pins from the inside&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was one more piece, the clear plastic piece for the console light. But, I am replacing that with &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9049.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9049.jpg"&gt;Laser Bear's SD Card extension&lt;/a&gt;, so I'm going to install that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9046_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an hour and a half, the upper shell is complete, and I think it looks fantastic. The black and gray perfectly complement the solid color everywhere else, and it looks like an official alternate color of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time to continue the teardown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lower Shell Teardown and Replacement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main componenet in the lower shell is the disc reader. It is held on with 18 screws around its perimeter, but we need to get to all of them first. First, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9071.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9071.jpg"&gt;the back panel comes off easily&lt;/a&gt;.  Then, the front controller panel is held in place &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9073.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9073.jpg"&gt;with plastic latches on the side&lt;/a&gt;. Just pop those out and the controller panel comes free. It is still connected to the base with a ribbon cable, so pull that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, the fan is held in place with two screws. The power plug can be detached with a little force and a little wiggle. After that, just start removing all the screws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9075_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I kept all the screws in order of where I pulled them from, but with the exception of the controller port screws, they're all the same. The replacement shell kit did not come with replacement screws, so I will reuse all of these during reassembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the screws removed, the disc reader is held in place by its plug on the motherboard. Again, gentle force, gentle wiggle and it comes right off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, if I weren't doing a shell replacement, I could begin the FlippyDrive installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9085_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To continue the teardown, these six screws must be removed. It may look like their purpose is to secure the hintsink, but they go through the motherboard into the bottom shell. When removed, my heatsink stayed pretty solid on my motherboard. I did not have to worry about it slipping off. I'm not sure if something else secured it other than the thermal paste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the screws are removed, the motherboard assembly is only held in place by its bottom plug in the power converter below, like the disc reader was. So, it comes off with some more wiggling. This exposes a metal plate held on with four screws. Remove those and we're nearly at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9086_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9088_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the remaining pieces are just sitting in place and can be easily picked up, except for the power converter. That has another four screws that are easily removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're now finally at the bottom and can start putting components into their new home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9091_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the components go back into the same position in the new shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is that the new shell is resin, not injection molded like the original. This means screw holes have not been primed AND they are slightly fragile. You don't want to over tighten or tighten too quickly. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9165.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9165.jpg"&gt;Otherwise, you might sheer the screw post.&lt;/a&gt; Often, I would move the screw back and forth in its hole to create enough room for it to naturally tighten further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before continuing too far, I removed the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9100.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9100.jpg"&gt;rubber feet&lt;/a&gt; from the original shell and transferred them to the new one. The replacement shell came with plastic ones that seemed stupid. I didn't use any tactics pulling out these feet. I just yanked em out! So, I damaged them slightly. They didn't stay flush in place in the new shell, so I used some epoxy to glue them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going step-by-step, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9094.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9094.jpg"&gt;I added on the power converter&lt;/a&gt; and screwed it in. Next was &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9098.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9098.jpg"&gt;the metal plate&lt;/a&gt; with its screws. And then &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9102.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9102.jpg"&gt;the motherboard plugged into the power converter&lt;/a&gt;, and the six screws going through the heat sink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disc reader is the next component to add, but we need to install the FlippyDrive first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;FlippyDrive Installation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are all the remaining components left for the lower half along with the FlippyDrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9112_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the FlippDrive we have the ribbon cable which sits in the disc reader plug, the FlippyDrive itself, its mounting bracket, the molded back plate with an ethernet port, the ethernet port, and a ribbon cable connecting the port to the drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive Wiki has an &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/installation/flippydrive.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/installation/flippydrive.html"&gt;excellent installation guide&lt;/a&gt;, which I mostly ignored because I had already watched Tito's YouTube video and assembly seemed obvious. This caused a few problems later with the order of assembly, so READ the intructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step is making a series of folds on the FlippyDrive's ribbon cable so it can recess in the disc plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9114_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to make this wacky W-shape with the folds. The valleys will go into the plug with the middle contacts sitting on the connectors in the plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should fit in the plug like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9127_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The excess ribbon cable should &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9130.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9130.jpg"&gt;fold around some of the case plugs&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for the next step, which is reinstalling the disc reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9133.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9133.jpg"&gt;narrow slit&lt;/a&gt; in each of the corners of the disc reader assembly where the metal is bent downwards. We want to position the ribbon cable so it is fed through that slit as the assembly is pushed onto the plug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9140_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, all we'll see is the end of the cable coming out of that corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next move is screwing in the &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9143.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9143.jpg"&gt;mounting bracket near the cable&lt;/a&gt;. The bracket has an extra slot for the screw that is no longer used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9153_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippDrive is then plugged into the cable and can then be mounted on the bracket. Depress the ribbon cable gate &lt;b&gt;from the middle of the gate!&lt;/b&gt; Not from the edges. The instructions make a huge point of saying you'll most likely damage the gate by closing on the edges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlippyDrive is now done! But I have two more components to install, the SD card extension and the ethernet port. However, here's where I did a few things out of order because I wasn't following the instructions. This resulted in some backtracking. Here's the correct order:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, because I'm using the SD card extension, that ribbon cable should be fed through one of the mounting posts and behind the mounting bracket. This is what &lt;a href="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension" title="https://www.laserbear.net/products/flippydrive-sd-extension"&gt;the official installation guide&lt;/a&gt; says. Look at the video on that page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9216_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connector is then &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9220.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9220.jpg"&gt;folded back into the SD card slot&lt;/a&gt; on the FlippyDrive. This makes the cable pretty snug in the shell keeping it from getting crushed during reassembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the ethernet port in the back is a VERY tight fit. If the disc reader has been fastened in place with all its screws, the port bumps up against the disc lid sensor on the top and the screw underneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9193_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to remove all screws holding the disc reader in place so I could slightly lift the disc reader assembly and wedge the port in place as the disc reader assembly was correctly set. This results in a second unused screw. This time, there is no extra place on a bracket to put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Third, I put the ethernet cable in backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9275_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blue bit goes on the outside not the inside.  LACES OUT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything plugged in, the FlippyDrive just snaps into its mounting bracket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9273_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier versions of the FlippyDrive used tiny screws on the bracket, but they figured out a really convenient way of just having it snap in place instead. It's very solid, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the FlippyDrive installed, it's time to start screwing. Cue the Michael Scott references, but many of the holes were tight and required a lot of back and forth to get everything in correctly. Some of the screws couldn't even go in all the way because things were too tight. So, there are a few screws slightly raised because I didn't want to completely strip them trying to force them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything screwed in, I had dreaded &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9174.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9174.jpg"&gt;putting in the controller port ribbon cable&lt;/a&gt;, but that was surprisingly easy. The blue tape made the cable strong enough to be pushed into its plug on the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9221_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the final step, one more piece had to be screwed in, the other end of the SD card extender into the power light position on the top. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9215.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9215.jpg"&gt;It fit perfectly&lt;/a&gt;, and the screws went in easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally at the end! When reassembling the two halves, you should always pop the lid! The back of the lid hits &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9278.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9278.jpg"&gt;the small fragile sensors&lt;/a&gt; in the back. These can easily be broken with too much force. Also, I had to make sure the SD card extender cable was correctly going behind the controller port assembly and in front of the disc reader. Not squished between other components.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything in place, it took a little bit of wiggling and force to get it closed, but it eventually snapped on. Then I screwed the outer shell screws to secure it all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9225_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looked so great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9230_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9227_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SD card was very discrete and easily accessible on the outside. The back had an ethernet port. I will probably never use it, but maybe I'll try PSO someday? I do have &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9241.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9241.jpg"&gt;the official broadband adapter&lt;/a&gt; in the bottom, but this doesn't give me access to the FlippyDrive on my network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought it into the other room, plugged it into the TV, and... all my games immediately appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9262_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It worked on the first try. It was so satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole build took me over 4 hours, but some of that was a little trial and error and a little Internet research on figuring out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;CubeBoot (aka FlippyDrive OS)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I received the Rev9 version of FlippyDrive which came with version 1.4.6 preinstalled. Loading is quite quick and the Gamecube automatically boots into CubeBoot. CubeBoot is the FlippyDrive's native game selection UI. Swiss has become the standard for Gamecube, but FlippyDrive wanted to provide something that felt more native to the Gamecube's own UI. I like this WAY more than just choosing games from a text list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the UI is very barebones. You can only choose games. There are no menus or settings available on the Gamecube itself. There is nowhere to configure Internet settings, and set up Bluetooth for a controller. All configuration is done with a config file on the SD card. &lt;a href="https://docs.flippydrive.com/configuration.html" title="https://docs.flippydrive.com/configuration.html"&gt;Details are here.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of now, Bluetooth has not been implemented for controllers, so I can't do anything there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you use the ethernet port, you don't need to do any Internet configuration since that is for WiFi only. But, besides playing games on the Internet, ethernet is only used for moving files around on the FlippyDrive. I can easily access the SD card by removing it from the extension, so I don't need that functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accessories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the outside, I'm using two major accessories, the MemCard Pro from 8BitMods and the HDMI adapter from Bitfunx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9252_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MemCard Pro is an amazing device that manages all game saves. Through CubeBoot, it will automatically select and/or create a memory card specific for that game. Set up for the MemCard Pro &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube" title="https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro-for-gamecube"&gt;continues in its own post&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little messy getting my original saves onto it, but I figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HDMI adapter is really great, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bitfunx HDMI adapter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best possible image you can get from a Gamecube is using the RGB component cables. But, those can be expensive, plus you'll need an additional device to convert the signal into HDMI for your TV. This HDMI adapter does that and much more. Plus, it was only $25 on Aliexpress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Dreamcast HDMI adapter, this is not doing any upscaling to 1080p. It is receiving the raw signal from the Gamecube and slightly massaging it to the nearest standard HD resolution. You could then pass this into your own upscaler, or just plug it in the TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9460_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, unlike the Dreamcast HDMI adapter, you have options. &lt;a href="https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo" title="https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo"&gt;GCVideo comes preinstalled&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you linedoubling and scanlines. These are all options you would have on an OSSC, but it's nice to have them in a device that has everything working perfectly by default. You can access this menu using the included remote. &lt;a href="https://www.bitfunx.com/product/bitfunx-hdmi-line-doubler-adapter-gc2hdmi-for-nintendo-gamecube-ngc-digital-to-hdmi/" title="https://www.bitfunx.com/product/bitfunx-hdmi-line-doubler-adapter-gc2hdmi-for-nintendo-gamecube-ngc-digital-to-hdmi/"&gt;There are more details on the product page.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My TV does not have an option to change the aspect ratio to 4:3, but there are several games that have widescreen support including &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9457.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9457.jpg"&gt;F-Zero GX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9430.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9430.jpg"&gt;Monkey Ball&lt;/a&gt;.

I can play all of my old games. I can also play hacks and special versions of games including &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9462.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251107_gamecube/IMG_9462.jpg"&gt;F-Zero AX&lt;/a&gt;, although that doesn't allow saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think modding a Wii or a Wii U might end up being the better option. You would have access to all of those libraries in addition to Gamecube. Also, Triforce games (F-Zero AX and Mario Kart Arcade GP) run natively on Wii and Wii U. I will probably look into this in the future, but I am content with this for now. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Mister, Analogue Pocket, modded Playstation 2, Dreamcast, and the Gamecube, I can play all of my favorite games from the past up through the mid-Bush years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/modding-the-gamecube-with-flippy-drive</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Assassin's Creed Shadows</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Assassin's Creed series finds its way to shove its story into fuedal Japan during Oda Nobunaga's conquest and unification. The long storied franchise which had always focused on Europe and the western expansion of the world spread itself to Japan via the attempted Catholic infiltration and invasion of the country. Like all AC games, you find yourself at a pivotal point in time, and carry out assassinations that shape the country's and world's history to create the world we live in today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213.png" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20251005144213_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows takes place around the year of 1579. Looking at real world history, the bulk of the story is set from 1581 through 1582, but also flashbacks to 1579, where those events serve at the catalyst for one of the protagonist's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe is a young woman from Iga whose family and village are trained in ninjutsu. She was first tested in 1579 when Oda Nobukatsu (Nobunaga's son) launched an unsuccessful attack on their village. Clumsily, she killed her first man as the rest of the ninja repeled the attack. From that day, she continued her hard training to match the level of the others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1581 (real life), Oda Nobunaga returned to Iga with his army of over 40,000 men, and slaughtered as many ninja and families as he could find. In the chaos, Naoe's father gathers an important artifact and flees. Naoe follows, but they are both run down by a &lt;i&gt;mysterious&lt;/i&gt; group of 12 masked individuals who call themselves the Shinbakufu. They steal the artifact and brutally injure both Naoe and her father. Her father dies as she loses consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe wakes later in a monastery healed by a boy and an old man. After regaining her strength she vows revenge against Oda Nobunga for slaughtering her village and the Shinbakufu for killing her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825190741_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rewinding a little bit, we are introduced to our other protagonist first, Yasuke. Yasuke is Nobunaga's Black samurai. His main story also begins in 1579 as Jesuit Alessandro Valignano brings him to Osaka as he meets with Oda Nobunaga. Nobunaga is curious about the black man as almost no one in Japan had ever seen a black person before. They've only ever met white Catholics. Nobunaga is impressed that Yasuke understands the Japanese language, and invites (orders) him to train at his castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Yasuka trains, he learns how a samurai should properly fight by balancing physical strength with mental strength. A duel between men is not just who is stronger, but how you can use your opponent's weaknesses against them. Through achieving this balance and showing his loyalty and honor in a fight, Nobunaga is so impressed that he "knights" him as a samurai. This is when Yasuke proclaims his name as "Yasuke."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years later in 1581, he is one of the samurai on the front lines attacking the Iga village, Naoe's village. The full game begins with you storming the village and killing ninja after ninja. You play about 15 minutes as him until the game switches to Naoe fleeing the village, and then you don't play him again until many hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824144138_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Naoe leaves the temple fully healed from her attack, you have nearly free reign of the entire expansive map of pre-Edo Period Kansai. The distances are miniaturized, but the huge map goes from the Kii province in the south (modern day Wakayama) to Wakasa province in the north (modern day southern Fukui). You can travel to Omi province in the east (modern day Shiga, almost Gifu) to Harima and Tamba provinces in the west (modern day Hyogo).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can visit incredible recreations of Himeji, Osaka, and Niji castles and estates, as well as over a dozen more castles. Armored forts also dot the landscape and there are vibrant towns both large and rich, and small and poor. Outside of the villages, the forests and mountains look incredible. The overall attention to authentic details is amazing. It feels like I'm walking through the forests of Sekighara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These natural, beautiful, and authentic environments are the center piece of Assassin's Creed Shadows. If you see something interesting in a direction, just go in that direction and see what's there. Eventually you find vantage points (towers) that will reveal more points of interest and this curiosity and exploration will continue to push you to all areas of the map. Often at the top of a hill, you'll see a new castle or fort you haven't explored before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824205831_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in gaming, the idea of "Do you see that building or mountain in the distance? You can go there." is pretty rote, but Assassin's Creed established and populaized this concept of open world exploration in its first game nearly 18 years ago. Actually, the first game is the only other AC game I've played of the whole series. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-impressions" title="https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-impressions"&gt;I wrote some impressions back then, too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to go anywhere and having towers to organically push players into new areas was what made Assassin's Creed such an interesting game that it became a watershed moment, and nearly all other open world games have adopted this idea. Nintendo even took this idea with Zelda Breath of the Wild and it became one of their most highest selling and praised games of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824213807_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why so Special?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, why is Assassin's Creed Shadows so special? Why should you play it? There are really just 3 short reasons. It's a really good "one of those." The graphics looks incredible. And it's set in Japan. Those are really the 3 reasons why people have been so positive about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assassin's Creed has been plagued with mediocre games for years. Once they struck gold with the first games, they kept pumping them out each year. There have been 14 mainline AC games in the last 18 years. And so many of them have been boring, broken, overwhelming, and completely uninteresting according to people. But, it was able to break into the mainstream, so every release kept selling and selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250825132404_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to play it because Ghosts of Tsushima was released a few years and seemed to do exactly what Assassin's Creed was doing. It was an open world set in feudal Japan where you run around and reach towers to unlock more points of interest on the map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions" title="https://theschlock.com/ghosts-of-tsushima-impressions"&gt;I did and did not like Ghosts&lt;/a&gt;. From an exploration point of view, it was a bit derivative fully using the same formula as Assassin's Creed, but it was a good "one of those." You could climb almost everywhere and there were interesting hidden points as you explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I never wrote my full thoughts on the game, but there were three major things I ultimately really disliked about Ghosts that are (mostly) fixed in Shadows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250824233554_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tone&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest thing I hated about Ghosts was the overall tone of the story and sidequests. Everything was a fucking downer. Of course, the overall story of Ghosts was about the mongul invasion which is a serious subject, but Japanese cinema and story-telling like to add a bit of lightheartedness to their tales. Every sidequest in Ghosts ends with a family murdered, or a town murdered, or any shred of hope dashed in the end. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My father has gone missing. Can you find him?" He's been robbed and murdered by bandits. "My wife is missing. Can you find her?" Murdered and ripped apart by bandits or monguls. "My children are missing. Can you find them?" Worked to death as slaves in a mongul camp. Why create such a beautiful lush environment only to dot it with the charred remains of villages and bodies of families and children? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, balance is important. Maybe they wanted to balance to beauty of the environment with death. But with the narrative so completely overwhelmed with negatives feelings and imagery, it dwarves the environment. You need some balance within your narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831103151_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows has a few different side story threads that are pretty ridiculous, especially the Yokai quest line. Much of these goofy quests remind me a lot of the goofy kind of side quests you would find the Yakuza games, the premiere Japanese developed open world game series. Even though they are sometimes too goofy, they play well against the main character who tends to play the straight-man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows never drags me down in the same way that Ghosts did. Although, eventually in the story, I think Naoe and Yasuke become a little too jokey with each other and other characters, so the tone ends up going in the wrong direction a little too far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I will say that Jin in Ghosts ends up being a much better developed character throughout the story. Naoe and Yasuke often become more of an avatar for the player, and you can often make choices that contradict the cutscenes and dont't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250828205305_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Repetitious Layouts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows hides its repitious buildings, foilage, and enemy layouts with a vast amount of variety. There really aren't all that many different models of trees in the game, but when placed in the environment along the sides of mountains and occasionally in towns, you really don't notice the repetition unless you really pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your base is a great example of this. In Shadows, you get a base and can put together the buildings, trees, and lots of other things anyway you like. I can create a pretty natural looking forest by rotating every tree I place. Combined together, you can't really tell which branches are the same on each tree. The photo below is from my base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250831220644_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some buildings in Shadows are obviously the same, but it doesn't really bother me too much. In real life, there are many houses that are the same because they all hired the same construction company. Also, many textures are reused in other castles and towns. But the layouts of all the castles and town are unique and are often historically accurately the layouts of the castles and towns they are meant to be. Towns and castles also have a lot of unique features that are not used anywhere in the game. Often, the developers tear down some walls or buildings to break up the repetition, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ghosts, all the mongul tents and camp set ups looked identical. Again, it makes sense that they would all have the same tents, but every tent had the treasures and weapons laid out in the exact same position. Each tent also had a same flap exposed in the exact same position so you could sneak in. Tents were almost also laid out in the exact position in every camp, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shadows also has various army and bandit camps with repeated layouts, but you have so many other castles, villages, estates, caves, mines, towers, and other places where you fight that there is so much variety among repeated elements. They don't hold back their layouts for story sequences only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250920153213_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authenticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghosts prides itself on authenticity. Despite being an American game studio, they took multiple trips to Tsushima island to study the natural landscape, attended workshops focused on the island's culture and traditions, took tons of reference photos, and were also huge fans of classic Japanese samurai cinema, especially of Kurosawa. They used all of this knowledge to create beautiful environments that look like paintings and still images from their favorite films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it felt like a fairytale. Open areas of tall grass blowing like waves in the wind. Rocky mountainous hills with tall cedar trees. Vast marshlands filled with those white marshy flowers. And also snowy mountains to the north so cold that you can't survive away from a fire for a few moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, Ghosts prisdes itself on authenticity, but are we supposed to believe this is an actual place? Tsushima is an island in the sea of Japan, which rarely gets snow. And those white marsh flowers only grow in marshes in the mountains, usually around May. Ghosts takes place in November. Also, there's a cherry blossom forest in November, what?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They wanted to shove in too much imagery into a situation that doesn't make sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250919230937_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The environments in Shadows is much more consistent with reality. Also, seasons change over time. Every real-life hour (about) half a season in the year scrolls by. (This also allows for enemies to respawn and match your level.) Summer, Fall, Winter, Spring. Cherry blossoms only bloom in spring. In summer, all the forests are a deep green like normal. Rice fields are planted and flooded. In fall, the leaves begin to turn, but also, people are out in the fields harvesting the rice. In winter, snow becomes deep in the north, but it's pretty bare in the south near the ocean, just like real life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the seasons changing, it allows them to have all the imagery of Japan that Ghosts wanted to have in a more natural way. The attention to detail in each of the different regions depending on the season is incredible. It feels like the seasons changing in reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927230209_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shallow Story and Characters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think Shadows excels best at exploring the environment, running through castles looting and killing, and naturally finding side story threads, it ultimately feels a bit shallow. Naoe and Yasuke are so stereotypical in their actions and dialogue. There's no weight behind anything they say or do. Everything in the story is telegraphed to the point where there are no real twists or turns. When you meet someone who seems remotely evil... Ah! I'll have to fight or kill this guy in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I've spent hours upon hours looting and killing everyone in the castles and forts that when the story says we "need to be careful" and "have a plan" to attack this specific character in a castle I've already been, it's laughable. Here's my plan: I'll just run in there and kill everyone just as I always do. And eventually that's what happens in the story. No build up needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story, dialogue, and character development of Ghosts had so much more weight behind it. Although, the story decisions in Ghosts also fell flat in the end when you just choose which ending to watch with your final action. All your actions throughout the game didn't mean anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Shadows, it was interesting to see how they weaved the overall Assassin's Creed story into Japanese history, but I could've easily just read a bullet point list on a wikipedia page and been just as satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250927154422_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;End of Act 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the story, in Act 1, we were running around as Naoe searching for leads on Oda Nobunaga to exact our revenge. Through various story threads, we meet Akechi Mitsuhide (one of Nobunaga's trusted generals). He tells Naoe that Nobunaga is one of the Shinbakufu, and he sets us up with an opportunity to kill Nobunaga at Honnoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The events happen in the same way they supposed did in real history in June 1582. Mitsuhide unsuspectingly lead his army into Kyoto and attacked Honnoji. You are able to use the chaos to fight your way through samurai into the temple where Oda Nobunaga stayed. The temple is set on fire, and you fight Nobunaga while the temple burns down around you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the final blow, Yasuke appears for the first time in hours to prevent your assassination. But the attack was successful either way. Nobunaga says that even if he were to flee, he reign as daimyo is over. He could never command his groups with authority again after this betrayal. He asks Yasuke to take his head as he commits seppuku due to his failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250902205314_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naoe flees the temple. Akechi revealed himself to be one of the Shinbakufu, not Nobunaga. With Nobunaga dead, unification of Japan stands still as the other generals and daimyo know fight for power. Akechi hopes to gain some power for himself, but there are so many rivals in his way. Naoe feels betrayed that she was only used as a pawn in his schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuke soon catches up with her. Naoe weilds a hidden spring-loaded palm knife that she had gotten from her father. She has used to assassinate all her targets so far and it's an iconic staple of all assassins through the AC franchise. Yasuke recognizes this blade. So, rather than fight Naoe out of loyalty for Nobunaga, he asks to join her. Akechi is their common enemy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining story of Shadows happens in two acts, but the focus of each of these acts happen nearly concurrently. Act 2 story quests focus on elimating the remaining members of the Shinbakufu and eventually reaching Akechi to kill him. Act 3 quests focus on the pasts of Naoe and Yasuke. How did Naoe's father know about the league of assassins and how did they come to Japan? Also, how is Yasuke tangled up with the assassins by knowing about the hidden blade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930213119_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After tracking down and killing all members of the Shinbakufu, you come to the final battle. Akechi is in Yamazaki castle, and you build your plans to attack with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. You meet a young Tokugawa Ieyasu (above) who takes his army away and doesn't join the battle, claiming that there will be more fighting in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's neat that you meet all three unifiers of Japan in the game. Oda Nobunaga began his campaigns to unify Japan, but was killed before he could complete it. Toyotomi is the second unifier, taking over for Oda in 1582 just after this battle where Akechi is rooted and killed. Nearly all areas of rebellion were quelled and brought under their power by 1592. Then, with Toyotomi's death in 1598, Tokugawa Ieyasu prevailed in &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/battle-of-sekigahara" title="https://theschlock.com/battle-of-sekigahara"&gt;the Battle of Sekighara&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed him to seize all power of Japan and usher in an era of peace (albeit under strict rule) for 250 years. It's funny how they protray him as a coward and schemer here as folks in Japan often have the same view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Toyotomi, Naoe and Yasuke lead the charge against Yamazaki Castle and eventually throw Akechi from the keep. Akechi flees on horseback, but Yasuke is able to keep up pace. He is eventually rundown in a small village down the river. Yasuke takes his revenge and cuts down Akechi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real history plays out nearly the same way. Toyotomi attacks Yamazaki Castle and Akechi flees later to be killed in a village nearby by farmers wanting to collect a bounty set by Toyotomi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250930215138_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Act 3 - Assassin's Creed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching story of Assassin's Creed is the battle of assassins and templars throughout the course of human history. Templars are much like the illuminati who want to control the world and hold all the power to themselves, and the assassins are a brotherhood of warriors who aim to thwart their plans and keep the free will of history to the people. Throughout time, these events have always been centered in Europe, the genesis of most modern day societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through investigating her family's past, Naoe learns that her mother met a Spanish assassin, who was an excommunicated member of the Assassin's Creed. He followed some templars to Nagasaki. Without the help of his brotherhood, he saught to recruit local people to form a Creed of his own to battle the templars. Naoe's mother was his first apprentice and they formed the Japanese brotherhood known as the Kakushiba Ikki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their brotherhood grew, they were able to have an audience with Emperor Go-Nara about the growing threat of templars in Japan. The emperor entrusted them with protecting the Imperial Regalia, 3 historical artifacts of extreme cultural significance (macguffins).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the Spanish assassin left Japan for some reason, and Naoe's mother continued leading the guild. The templars eventually found their guild. They attacked, killed all members of the guild (almost), and stole the regalia. In reality, Naoe's mother survived the attack and kept one of the artifacts, the jewel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Way back in the opening of the game, this is why the Shinbakufu singled out Naoe and her father. Her father carried this box. By killing Akechi, you were finally able to retrieve this box and learn of its importance. You return in back to its sacred vault underground with another one of the regalia that Hattori Hanzo was able to retrieve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907090527_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the coin is Yasuke. Yasuke came to Japan as a slave on a boat run by Duarte de Melo and Nuno Caro, both members of the Portuguese templar order. They find Yasuke (whose original name is Diogo) and his mother in their quarters trying to clean some papers that fell on the floor. In typical evil villain fashion, they bring them out on the deck to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They shoot Yasuke's mother in the head and turn to him next. But, from above, an assassin appears and a fight ensues. Yasuke is kicked overboard away from danger. This is how he recognized the hidden palm blade held by Naoe. He knows that the assassins fight his enemies, so that's why he wanted to join her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yasuke tracks down Duarte and kills him. This leads him to Nuno Caro whom he also kills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their plans in Japan were to manipulate the Shinbakufu into stealing the Imperial Regalia and claim it for themselves. Their mission as templars were to bring the regalia back to their order and use it for some plot device bullshit. Ultimately, they wanted to keep the artifacts for themselves as they thought it would help them control Japan by shaping Japanese principles and beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/ac_shadows/Assassins_Creed_Shadows_20250907215726_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I think the entire story of Assassin's Creed has become a complete mess, you really only get this tiny kernal of its overarching story here. Shadows feels like a small side story in the universe, even though the game is far from short. (I finished with 165 hours.) I think it's neat how they found a good point in history that made sense for their European order of assassins and templars to reach Japan. And it's neat how this idea of foreign invasion through manipulation was eventually the reason Tokugawa closed to the country to all foreigners in 1602 after he gained control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its flat dialogue and characters, I felt like I had a better experience than I did with Ghosts. Ultimately, I think both games had different focuses and vibes, so it's perhaps not fair to compare them head-to-head. But, I think Shadows did a slightly better job achieving its goals than Ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am really excited to play the sequel to Ghosts, though: &lt;b&gt;Ghosts of Yotei&lt;/b&gt;. After watching some minutes of people playing story sequences, the dialogue and voice acting is world's beyond anything in AC Shadows. The location is up in Hokkaido now, so having mountainous terrain and snow make sense. In the differences of elevation, you can naturally have all the variations of environment. The story doesn't focus on a brutal invasion, so I think there is room for some lighthearted elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't want to get my hopes up too high, but I think it has the opportunity to take the best things from both Ghosts of Tsuhima and Assassin's Creed Shadow to create something remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a lot of time, I think playing through Assassin's Creed Shadows is worth it. Once you have full reign of the map, it's amazing to explore the mountains, forests, towns, and castles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sale&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games of this magnitude are so impressive that it seems almost a crime to buy it at a reduced price. I ended up getting it for $35 on ebay with a coupon. It should've included the newly released DLC, but they stiffed me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before too long, there will be a sale or some kind of bundle where it can be easily got for a cheap price. I'm sure over Thanksgiving and Christmas, you can find a deal. I plan on looking for deals on the $25 DLC at that time, too.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-shadows</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/assassins-creed-shadows</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>Game Thoughts</category><category>Games</category><category/><category/></item><item><title>TapTo NFC Reader Enclosure</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After getting a Mister FPGA last year, I wanted to get ALL the accessories and try out everything the system had to offer (within reason). One of the accessories I bought into was TapTo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;TapTo (or Zaparoo)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;TapTo (now renamed Zaparoo due to fear (or reality) of trademark infridgement) is a service that constantly runs in the background on Mister. With a connected NFC reader, any NFC signal it reads will automatically run instructions. The main use of this is having a physical set of cards or objects representing your favorite games. Tap the object and the game runs automatically without having to go through menus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a fun way of bringing physicality back to a digital platform, and people have let their creativity fly. There's a replica miniature C64 disk drive with an NFC reader inside, and you insert cards like floppies. Some folks have put NFC stickers on their physical game cartridges and use those to boot up games. People print their own NFC cards with various styles and images. People have also made figures with NFC buttons inside. The sky is the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, I thought this was all unnecessary. You're removing one of the advantages of having a digital platform which is reducing your amount of clutter. But, you can have TapTo (Zaparoo) do more than just execute games. You can have it execute button macros. And you can have it execute random games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was most interested in the random games. The standard randomization is to have it choose a console and execute a random games on that console. But, unlike the Analogue Pocket, you can build lists of favorites on the Mister using MGL files. So building lists of my favorite games in each genre, I can Tap a card, and have it run a random Shooter or Puzzle game or Fighting game. These are all single serving games, so it makes sense to randomly try one for 5 or 10 minutes and find a new one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, rather than use printed cards, Nintendo Amiibos use NFC, too. I could register the Pacman Amiibo to boot up a random arcade game, and use Ryu to boot up a Fighter. Dr. Mario for Puzzle games. And for Shooters? A Vic Viper would've been amazing. The closest is Star Fox, but those figures look terrible. I just went with Mega Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;NFC Reader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use any NFC reader with Mister, but all the official images used a particular one. It was only 764&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; on Aliexpress! So cheap! Why not buy it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1669_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was so small! I was thinking that it would be the size of a trading card, but it's less than half that size. This is great because it has allowed creative folks to sneak it into their enclosures and even in their Mister cases. My Mister case is shoved into the shelf, though, so it's not practical for me to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to create a platform that could stick out of shelf for easy placement of Amiibo figures. Because the reader is like a tiny trading card, I thought I could use one of those hard plastic trading card protectors. Just screw the thing in there, and it would make for a pretty piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hard Plastic Card Protector&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon had a few different sizes of these sandwich plate style plastic card protectors available, so I bought a standard trading card size and a smaller size closer to the dimensions of the NFC reader. This one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TheCase99-Chocolate-Seal-Size-R.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1" title="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0CQ3R5ZGX?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&amp;th=1"&gt;Amazon Link&lt;/a&gt;. Now, a year later, it's out of stock, but I bought it for only 660&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Maybe that's expensive for a single card protector, but I think it's a good price for an NFC enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, with buying this protector, I wasn't really thinking about how the reader was going to slip between the two plastic plates. A card is as thin as paper. The PCB of the reader is thicker than that, plus it has a USB-C connector on it. The protector came with a thin plastic frame border for the card to hold it in place, but that would not work with the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1671_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the protector was a good size, but I did not think about the USB-C connector. I wanted the PCB more centered, but the USB-C plug on the cable is WAY thicker than the connector. The USB-C connector would have to be flush with the outer rim of the plastic for it to connect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The included screws weren't longer enough for added height, so I had to buy some new ones. My local hardware store was able to identify the guage of the screws at M4. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/image/tapto/IMG_2660.jpeg" title="https://theschlock.com/image/tapto/IMG_2660.jpeg"&gt;They sold these packs of screws, nuts, and washers.&lt;/a&gt; I had a few different lengths from some other projects, but I bought one of those packs with 15mm length screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I ultimately used the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4 Screws - M4 Size - 15mm Length&lt;br/&gt;4 Nuts - M4 Size&lt;br/&gt;8 Washers - M4 Size&lt;br/&gt;4 Thumb Nuts - Reusing the ones including with the protector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_1676_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a little tight, but it had to be to hold the USB-C connector in place. If it was too loose, the plates wouldn't hold it and you couldn't plug it in without pushing the PCB in further. Although, too tight and it could've cracked the plates or warped the connector. Adding the washers and screws gave it just enough height to hold it in place well enough. Although, it still slipped around and it could be pulled out easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perfect solution would be to design a 3D printed bracket that could be flush with all edges of the plates and hold the NFC reader in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;3D Printed Bracket&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, after almost a year after putting the plates together, I finally designed a bracket. I didn't realize that my sister had a small 3D printer, so it was the perfect excuse to finally make this thing. Her model of printer was a ToyBox, a more accessible consumer level printer which allowed her kids to make little figurines and such. It also accepted custom STL files, so you could still print whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking online, &lt;a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" title="https://www.tinkercad.com/"&gt;TinkerCad&lt;/a&gt; was recommended as an easy online program for creating STL files. And it was really easy to figure out how to move around the view, create objects, and also create negative objects which cut into the solid shapes ultimately creating and shaping your vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being very precise and measuring all lengths using a tape measure, I put together the model. The plates measured 74mm by 74mm, and I added 5mm height. The NFC reader measured 40mm by 61mm, so I added some grooves for the reader to rest into the model and stay in place. I added rounded corners and measured the screw holes. I also added some divots for the washers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not take long to create the model. I cut out more of the solid areas to use less material when printing. Also, I flipped the model upside down thinking that it would be better to have the flat areas printed first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/tapto/TapTo-Bracket-Thin-Upside-Down.webp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the file: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11UX3tfvHsffEDEHT3y7o3tb_nzsDfd-w/view?usp=sharing"&gt;Google Docs / TapTo Bracket Thin Upside-Down.stl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister had several failed attempts trying to print it for some reason. I've never owned a 3D printer, but it seems like there's so much variance in print quality depending on properly seeding the model to the bench, using quality materials, making sure the printer head is clean to allow clean material on the bench, the speed of building the model, and generally just the overall quality and precision of the printer itself. Seems like a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend Jason was coming to visit, so I asked if he knew anyone with a decent printer setup. And he was able to get an clean print of my file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8751_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an exact clean print! It felt nice and sturdy compared to other 3D printed parts I've had before. It was SO exact that when I put the NFC reader into place &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8755.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8755.jpg"&gt;it perfectly snapped into position.&lt;/a&gt; There was absolutely no clearance. It was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8767_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took apart the base, and began assembling it with the bracket in the middle. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8769.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8769.jpg"&gt;The washers fit in the divots perfectly.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8771.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8771.jpg"&gt;The screw holes matched exactly with the screw holes on the plastic plates.&lt;/a&gt; Things were tight, but all the dimensions were exact enough that it fit together like a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USB-C connector was a little recessed in the bracket, but the connector on the plug was long enough to compensate. And it fit in the connector perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8773_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8779_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After fitting everything together, I was so amazed at the results. I would expect there to be some problem with size or quailty or variance. Like the print would be slightly too large or small. Or maybe there was some piece of the PCB sticking out that I hadn't noticed before. Or the inlets weren't deep enough. Or I messed up my measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no problems at all. It fit like a glove. Pac-Man agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251018_nfc/IMG_8794_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel to use the file and part list to create your own. The only thing I would add is a TapTo or Mister FPGA sticker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/tapto-nfc-reader-enclosure</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/tapto-nfc-reader-enclosure</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>Modding a Sega Dreamcast</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I started thinking about the Dreamcast again. The recent ADGQ run of Crazy Taxi resparked some dormant brain cells and reminded me of all the arcade fun the console had to offer. Ultimately, back in the day, I would shelf the console in favor of the Playstation 2 and its library of much deeper story telling games. But, the console would occasionally get pulled out of storage when friends were around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this wave of nostalgia, I purchased several hardware mods to build an ultimate Dreamcast with all my favorite games available to play at a touch. I received all the packages, but my Dreamcast was half a world away in the United States. This summer, I returned home, and now I have all of my original Dreamcast hardware on hand, and finally took the weekend to put everything together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8103_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoilers. It is excellent, and I am amazed how easy it was to install everything and how seemless everything worked on the first try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dreamcast Hardware&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is all of my original hardware from back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7892_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few surprises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, I had completely forgotten that I bought a VGA box. After really crawling into my memory about when this happened, I do recall hooking it up to my LCD monitor a few times. But I never used it that way for long periods of time because it was a nuisance to my computer set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, I had also forgotten about some other prior modding. 2007 was probably the last time I had used my Dreamcast. At that time, I had purchased some new Shmup releases and the discs would scrap along the shell inside of the disc tray. &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/end-gen-dreamcast" title="https://theschlock.com/end-gen-dreamcast"&gt;I made a few modifications&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7913.jpg"&gt;taped the lid sensor&lt;/a&gt; to always be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dreamcast Mods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For modding and upgrading the Dreamcast, I purchased the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- &lt;b&gt;GDEmu Disc Emulator&lt;/b&gt; (8019&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $53.46)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Noctua Fan Replacement&lt;/b&gt; (4924&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $32.82)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;DreamPSU Power Supply Replacement&lt;/b&gt; (3304&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $22.03)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Console Shell Replacement&lt;/b&gt; (in Smoke Black) (4994&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $33.29)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Bitfunk Dreamcast HDMI Adapter&lt;/b&gt; (2519&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $16.79)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;Retro Fighters D6 Controller&lt;/b&gt; (released in Feburary 2025) ($65.89)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;8BitMods VMU Pro&lt;/b&gt; (in Smoke Black) (released in November 2025) ($94.44)&lt;br/&gt;- &lt;b&gt;128gb SD Card&lt;/b&gt; (2865&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; / $18.77)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 5 hardware mods were purchased from AliExpress from various retailers. I bought the D6 Controller from Retro Fighters directly. The VMU Pro isn't out yet, but it's only available through the 8BitMods site. Those prices include shipping to Japan. Maybe it's a bit expensive, but I think it's a small price to have a dedicated machine that can easily play all of these great games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I should note that understanding which mods to buy and what was required came from another one of Tito's &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGD-Ti7CFA"&gt;Macho Nacho YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;my PS2 build&lt;/a&gt;. He put all of this stuff together a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I decided to skip using the DreamPSU and the HDMI Adapter. Since its release, the DreamPSU has had &lt;a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html" title="https://www.retrorgb.com/dreamcast-replacement-psu-design-analysed.html"&gt;some criticism&lt;/a&gt;. It seems like the DreamPSU doesn't really offer anything new to the Dreamcast, and could potential cause harm. If there's nothing wrong with your current Dreamcast power supply, then there's no reason to get rid of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I skipped the HDMI adapter because I am able to get crisp video through the VGA box. I can pass the VGA and audio signal into my OSSC, and use that to display on my TV through HDMI. Also, the HDMI adapter works with the VGA signal, so the few games that don't work with VGA won't work with it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Saturday afternoon was spent replacing the Dreamcast shell and installing the GDemu and the fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7895_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to note that the GDemu only works on &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7901.jpg"&gt;version VA1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; consoles, denoted by the circled 1 on the bottom sticker. Revision VA1 consoles are the most common, so you most likely own that one. VA0 consoles were only produced through mid-1999, so perhaps only launch models in the US were VA0. The VA1 started production in mid-1999 and continued through late 2000. VA2 revision models began production around October and December 2000, but so they may have come to market in early 2001, a few months before Sega announced the Dreamcast was done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disassembly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dreamcast can be completely taken apart using a Phillips head screwdriver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disassembly starts with the 4 screws keeping the outer shell in place. You'll need to remove the modem to get at the 4th corner screw. With the shell removed, nearly all the inner components are visible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7906_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GD reader is the large piece in the middle. We'll replace that with the GDemu unit later. The left component is the power supply. The on/off switch in the front left is plugged into it. The controller port assembly is the component in the front. It has a battery that manages the internal clock. It also gives power to the fan on the right. Everything sits on top of a metal shield. The Dreamcast motherboard is between this shield and another one on the very bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first component to remove is the GD reader. Mine was attached using 2 screws, even though there were holes for 3 screws. Maybe I lost one while I was messing around in 2007.  Be sure to pull it out as an entire unit with the metal plate on the bottom. You don't need to disassemble the reader itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7915_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7916_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is the power supply. The power supply is held in place by 2 screws and its connection to the motherboard. First, unplug the on/off switch connected in the back and then remove the screws. The motherboard connection is really strong, so it can be difficult to pull it off with finesse. I rocked mine back and forth a bit, but be careful not too do this too much as it could dislodge the connector from the motherboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power supply has a plastic shield that sits between it and the surrounding components, so don't lose that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next component to remove is the controller assembly in the front. You'll need to remove the power cable going to the fan and unplug the ribbon cable going to the motherboard. Both cables are removed pretty easily. Just gently rock them back and forth with a little bit of force and they'll come out. The component is held in place with 4 screws next to the controller ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7918_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, there are only 3 more components to remove. The fan and the power button are only held in place with 2 screws each. Those are easy to remove. The direction they're installed is important, but it's easy to tell which was they go. We'll replace the fan later, so we don't need to worry about that one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final component is the motherboard, sandwiched between two metal shields, screwed to the bottom of the shell with 8 screws. After removing the screws, the upper metal shield is still attached to the motherboard with a few plastic pins. Removing them is unnecessary, so leave them alone. You can remove the upper shield and motherboard together as a single piece. The video plugs are set into the shell, so it takes a bit of movement to find the right angle, but eventually you can pull the motherboard out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that remains is &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7919.jpg"&gt;the bottom shield&lt;/a&gt; with two termal pads. Nothing is holding this in place, so it's easy to pull out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7923_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gutted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reassembly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I removed each component, I laid the screws next to them so I could remember which screws were used in which positions. Only a few components will be replaced, but these components rely on reusing the original screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7925_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new shell, first I placed the bottom thermal shield. Then, I screwed in the power button. It's important to note that the front plastic controller port panel must be set in place before putting the motherboard in. Also, VERY IMPORTANT, make sure the termal pads are in the correct position on the bottom plate before putting the motherboard in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One small problem with my reassembly was a single screw &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7928.jpg"&gt;being misaligned&lt;/a&gt;. All other points of the motherboard were perfect except for this small spot. I'm not sure why this happened, but I decided to proceed rather than remove everything and solve the problem. The screws only held the board in place and it was very secure without this screw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7931_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the motherboard was secure, I put the power supply back into place, and made sure to put the plastic shield in the correct position. Make sure the power button cable moves underneath the component like it did before. Push the board into its connector, screw it in with the 2 screws, and connect the power button. The power plug in the back should be flush with the shell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the front, angle the controller port into the shell, then use the 4 screws to attach it to the build. Then plug in the ribbon cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, everything should be pretty smooth, and we have only the fan and the GDemu left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7934_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dreamcast GDemu Disc Emulator&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GDemu is a PCB with an SD card slot and a button. It plugs into the motherboard in the exact position as the GD reader and acts as an emulator. Here's the GDemu board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7938_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as the GD reader reads the discs and gives data to the motherboard, the GDemu also sends game data. You fill up the SD card with a bunch of games, and the GDemu reads the currently selected "disc" and sends the data to the board. The SD card needs to be in a specific format, but I did that &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation" title="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation"&gt;preparation back in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the SD card, each disc is stored in a specific numbered position, so the GDemu ultimately acts like a disc changer. The first CD in the list is the default disc loaded when the Dreamcast is turned on. This is where the GDemu menu application is stored. From the menu, you can choose any game you installed. Additionally, you can switch games/discs using the button. Pushing the button loads the next disc in the list. This is really only useful for multi-disc games, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;GDemu Assembly and Installation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GDemu package came with everything you see here: the GDemu PCB, SD card extender, an 8gb SD card, some plastic pieces, and some screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7936_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did not come with any instructions, so I was supposed to figure out how everything went together on my own. It's not too difficult to understand, but there are a few things that aren't so obvious. I found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EWUs-zDwcU"&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; of a guy putting together nearly the same thing, which helped me out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, you don't need any of the plastic parts to connect the GDemu. You can plug the GDemu into the motherboard directly and be done with it. However, the purpose of the plastic pieces is to seel the internal components from the outside and allow the fan to do its job of efficiently venting hot air. Whether or not the fan actually does this is a different question, but its best to try and help the Dreamcast accomplish this original goal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first step in assembly is attaching the SD card extender to the large plastic cover. There are 2 tiny screws used to do this. (I had to use a smaller Phillips screwdriver to accomplish this.) &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7939.jpg"&gt;With the SD card extender in position&lt;/a&gt;, the tiny screws don't screw into it. They screw into the post beside it, and hold the extender in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7943_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That YouTube video was very helpful for understanding that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step is screwing the GDemu board into the same plastic assembly. Connect the SD card extender into the SD card on the GDemu board. The ribbon cable is too long, but it's okay to have the extra length spill out of the back. There's nothing behind it that is harmful. You may be able to fold the cable inside of the plastic piece, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board attaches with two screws. Be sure to put the button into the plastic shell before screwing in the board. Also, be sure not to screw the board too tight. The bigger plastic button needs some clearance so it can click the board's button easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7945_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7948_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there should be one long screw, one short screw, and one more plastic tube piece left. After plugging the GDemu into the motherboard, it becomes obvious where these pieces go. The back end of the plastic cover lines up perfectly with one of the GD reader screw holes. This is for the short screw. The front edge of the GDemu board hovers over another screw hole. The plastic tube props up the board and allows the screw to pass through into the base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything assembled and screwed into place, the GDemu board should be held above the metal shield. It looks pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7951_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Noctua Fan Mod&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final bit to install is the Noctua Fan. My order included the full fan kit, and a few extras. We only need the fan and a single screw from the full kit. The extras where some 3D printed brackets, and a conversion cable from the fan to the Dreamcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7954_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D printed pieces were so cheap. I'm no 3D printing expert, by the overall quality looked like they used a 1st gen 3D printer to make them? What creates that rough unfinished imprecise surface? Is that from using poor materials? Or not properly calibrating your machine? Or not steadying the model on the surface pad while printing? They look so ugly, but they're internal components, so who cares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7960_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7969_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusing the screws from the original Dreamcast fan, I attached the new fan hood to the shell. Then using one of the included screws in the kit, I attached the fan to the hood. Make sure the direction of the fan is going outward. There's a small arrow on the fan indicating its direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After plugging the fan cable into the controller port board, I scrinched the cables under the controller port ribbon cable to keep them secure in a position away from touching something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7966_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's one final modification left. The Noctua fan takes up more space inside the Dreamcast and it interferes with the lid hatch. The mechanical component is a full squared piece and a section of it needs to be removed. Because of this, we've given those other two printed pieces as a lid hatch replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the terrible print quailty of the components caused troubles. The inner peg is meant to be shoved through the larger peg and create the lid hatch. My inner peg was too fat, or the hole was too thin, so when pushing the peg through the hole it didn't go all the way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7981_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peg was about 2mm longer, which meant the whole piece couldn't fit into the lid flushly. I tried shoving the peg in further and wiggling it into place, but it was still too long. I used a nail file to make the piece a little thinner and that worked. Although, not really. Now the piece was too loose so when the Open Tray button was pressed, the lid latch wouldn't go back into its extended position, so the lid couldn't be closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7990_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lid latch component is very delicate. It needs to be loose enough to freely move back and forth between the two screw posts. When the button is pressed, it moves one way, then the spring brings it back to its original position. So, the two pieces also need to have a complete strong bond together so the spring doesn't pull the latch back on its own. Using the nail file, the middle piece was now too loose. Why did they print this as two pieces? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7988_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still had some epoxy from an earlier project, so I glued the two pieces together. The cheapness of the material probably helped fuse the two pieces together even better than usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, the piece was still too rigid in the lid. I used my screwdriver head to widen the holes even more, and the piece finally moved smoothly. Much like the button component, these screws should not be too tight. They should be just tight enough to hold the piece into position and allow it to move freely back and forth. The lid finally opened and closed like it was supposed to after all this work. (This was the longest part of the physical build.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complete&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the pieces of the puzzle finally put into place, I secured the top part of the shell on to the base, tightened the outer 4 screws, and the build was complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_7992_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I plugged the VGA box into my OSSC, plugged video and power in to the Dreamcast, turned it on, and it worked perfectly the first time. That beautiful Dreamcast opening filled the room with its ambience, and the GDemu menu popped up showing all the games &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation" title="https://theschlock.com/dreamcast-gdemu-software-preparaation"&gt;that I had added back in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8012_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video Conversion and OSSC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My Dreamcast is using the VGA Box that I purchased decades ago to send its video signal into the OSSC. The OSSC translates that into an HDMI signal which I'm plugging into my TV. Even though I just bought a new TV, my TV doesn't really like 480p signals and it really doesn't like 960p signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FirebrandX had created the "perfect" timings for the Dreamcast a couple years ago with the following settings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Sync opt. &gt; &lt;br/&gt;    Analog sync LDF = Off&lt;br/&gt;Output opt. &gt; &lt;br/&gt;    480p/576p proc = Line2x&lt;br/&gt;Sampling opt. &gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Sampling phase = 45 deg&lt;br/&gt;    480p in sampler = DTV 480p&lt;br/&gt;    Allow upsample2x = off&lt;br/&gt;&lt; Adv. timing &gt; 480p:&lt;br/&gt;    H. samplerate = 858&lt;br/&gt;    H. Synclen = 62&lt;br/&gt;    H. backporch = 111&lt;br/&gt;    H. active = 640&lt;br/&gt;    V. synclen = 6&lt;br/&gt;    V. backporch = 34&lt;br/&gt;    V. active = 480&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This causes a black screen for me because my TV doesn't like 960p signals. Turning the output option back to PassThru also creates a black screen with these settings. If I leave all these values at default, I get a very beautiful image, but unfortunately it's stretched to the 16:9 ratio as shown above. My TV doesn't have a 4:3 option, so I would need another box that converts 480p or 960p to a 1080p signal and allows 4:3 to be forced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Bitfunx HDMI converter does force 4:3 and gives a clean image, but there are no video options at all. You can't do scanlines or change the fuzziness of model edges. I dunno... it doesn't look right to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, between choosing an imperfect toolbox or a single use hammer, I think I'll stick with the toolbox. If I somehow can afford a RetroTink4k in the future, then that's probably the best path for me and my TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;RetroFighters D6 Controller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I built my setup for the Playstation 2, I also bought an 8bitdo Retro Receiver so I could use a modern wireless controller with the old games. Wanting to do the same with the Dreamcast, I looked around for options. I decided to purchase the D6 controller from RetroFighters, which is unconventional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this controller a lot, although I don't think it's for everyone. I wrote a review &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller" title="https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller"&gt;in a separate post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;8BitMods VMU Pro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet to be released, 8BitMods is in the final stages of completing its VMU Pro. The VMU Pro is a high-end game device that manages all of your Dreamcast save files, but goes further with a full color LCD screen and allows its own custom software to be run. In particular, they have shown video of running 8-bit emulators for GameBoy, GameBoy color, Master System, and the NES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's being billed as the original ultimate vision of the Dreamcast VMU finally coming true. Preorders began back in May and it should finally ship in November. I will make a post about it after I've had long enough to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Dreamcast Lives on!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very happy with how well this whole project came together. Installing all the mods was very simple. Managing games and details is also very simple. And there is still more to come with the VMU Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While playing pirated games on the Dreamcast has been available since its release, it's amazing how much the tech has matured over the years, and how much stuff is still being released for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a Dreamcast in storage, I would suggest giving these mods a try. You'll be able to relive all those old memories again, and make some new ones with unique games you never had a chance to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251004_dreamcast/IMG_8033_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite games of all time, Rez, originated on the Dreamcast. These days, there are other modern ways of playing with a few more options. But, there's a debug version of Rez which allows you to mess with performance, enemies variance, and also have a free camera! (More on this in the future, maybe)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modded-console-game-inventory" title="https://theschlock.com/modded-console-game-inventory"&gt;Modded Console Game Inventory&lt;/a&gt; page has been updated with all the games I plan on giving a try. Take a look and see if having a Dreamcast library immediately available to play on your TV sounds right for you. :)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/><category>Game-Related Projects</category></item><item><title>RetroFighters D6 Controller</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When modding and building a full modern day &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast" title="https://theschlock.com/modding-a-sega-dreamcast"&gt;set up for my Dreamcast&lt;/a&gt;, I was in the market to look for a modern controller to use with it. The original Dreamcast controller was fine for it's day, but the controller is really big and clunky. Also, the D-pad is tiny and imprecise. I wanted something better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I built my &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;setup for the Playstation 2&lt;/a&gt;, I bought an 8bitdo Retro Receiver, so I could use a modern Playstation controller with the old games. Wanting to do the same with the Dreamcast, I looked around for options. However, Dreamcast controllers are very unique because you connect the memory card to them. There isn't a separate slot on the console like the Playstation and Gamecube. So, buying a Bluetooth receiver for the controller port isn't the best option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found RetroFighters, a vintage game controller manufacturer which created wireless Dreamcast controllers with the use of Memory Cards in mind. For their wireless controllers, the reciever plugged into the controller port is a large unit where you also plug in your memory card. Their most popular controller is the StrikerDC, but I decided to go with their most recent controller instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8122_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released in late 2024, the D6 Controller looks more like a Saturn controller than a Dreamcast controller. It has 6 face buttons instead of 4 and it only has a D-Pad rather than both a D-Pad and a Stick. RetroFighters' goal for the D6 was to create the ultimate handheld controller for Dreamcast fighting games. The movement of the D-pad matches that of the Saturn, so you can get those perfect fireballs compared with the D-pad on the standard controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the buttons are very clicky, which can turn people off, but I think the controller feels amazing. I think it's even better than the 8bitdo's M30. This is mainly because all of the buttons are the same size. Super Nintendo games feel terrible on the M30 because the top row of buttons are smaller and more concave. The D6 gives equal size and importance to all buttons, and the button presses feel great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I wanted this controller because it comes with a USB dongle. The StrikerDC only works with the Dreamcast so it's a single-use $55 controller. With the D6, I can use it with the Analogue Pocket, the Mister, and even the Switch for simple games. (It's excellent with Tetris.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8116_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the biggest question...  How does this controller work for games like Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure, or anything that uses the Stick for movement? On the bottom of the controller, there's a mode switch. All the way to the left, the D-pad operates as the D-pad. Switch the mode to the middle, and the D-pad operates as the Left stick. Switch the mode to the right, and it's the Right stick, which was the Dreamcast doesn't have, but other consoles do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still limited in that you can't use both the Left stick and D-pad at the same time. Also, the D-pad focuses on digital input, so games that rely on Analog movement from the Left stick won't feel so great. In this case, the original controller would be the better option. But, for the niche this controller is trying to fill, I think it works perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, as another note, the receiver base only allows a single memory card as opposed to original controllers which have two slots for two memory cards. I think this is because the controller has vibration. So, it's using a fake second slot as a rumble pak. Ultimately, I think this is another con against the controller as you can't do any memory management with just the controller. You'll need a second controller, or do management directly from VMU to VMU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/251010_d6/IMG_8124_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think it's a great controller, although it's not the ultimate solution for playing all games on the Dreamcast. It feels great to pick up and hold, and cycling through menus is a breeze. It's worth the money in my opinion if you have a Dreamcast, enjoy playing fighting games on the Dreamcast and don't like arcade sticks, and also have several other devices or consoles with retro games.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/retrofighters-d6-controller</link><category/><category/><category>Games</category><category/></item><item><title>Tsukechi Gorge 付知峡</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When crossing the border from Hida into northern Nakatsugawa, the Tsukechi river becomes one of the major lifelines of region, both shaping mountains and determining where ancestores settled. The basin of Tsukechi town is home to many farms, onsen, and camping grounds as everyone is just one step away from nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Tsukechi river is formed from all the runoff of the surrounding towering mountains. Following the river up to its source, some the valleys are so close together, over millenia the rushing water has created deep recessions resulting in several gorges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area along the river to the east has dubbed itself as The Tsukechi Gorge. It's free to park and free to walk, but they do ask for a 200&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; donation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main feature of the hiking are some beautiful slightly engineered waterfalls that contribute to the crystal clear blue water below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7741_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7757_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a very easy hike and offers some great views of nature. So much so that it attracts a lot of attention from city folk. I was quite surprised at &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7732.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7732.jpg"&gt;how many people came to this place&lt;/a&gt;. People were everywhere on the trails, and there was often congestion. It was a national holiday, though, so I guess everyone had off from work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to get a quick couple of shots of my friends on a bridge through the woods without others walking by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250915_tsukechi/IMG_7780_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zach, Dirk, and I stayed at &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/doai-onsen" title="https://theschlock.com/doai-onsen"&gt;The Doai Onsen&lt;/a&gt; the night before, so getting to the Tsukechi Gorge was easy. We arrived around 10am, which was apparently right before the rush. We hiked around the gorge for about 40 minutes maybe. By the time we were leaving, there was a line of cars down the one-lane mountain road waiting to park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure why everyone decided to come here on this day, but it might be best to visit on a weekday if you come up here.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/tsukechi-gorge</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/tsukechi-gorge</link><category/><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Travel</category><category>Japan</category><category/><category/></item><item><title>Doai Onsen 渡合温泉</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Doai Onsen &lt;span class='ja'&gt;度合温泉&lt;/span&gt; is a Ryokan deep in the forests and mountains of northern Nakatsuragawa, close enough to the southern border of Gero to consider it like Hida. Once you reach the turn-off from the main road, it takes over 30 minutes of driving on a narrow single lane road through the forest and along valley cliffs to reach the remote buildings. It's deep enough in the forest that cellphone reception is hard to come by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7419_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the inn is to relax with nature while shedding the modern conveniences of the Internet and electricity. To become less digital and more analogue. There are very few lights at Doai Onsen and after 10pm, the generator is turned off. The hallways and rooms are only illuminated by lantern at that point, of which there are more than 300 at the inn in various styles. The numerous amount of lanterns have become the mascot of Doai Onsen, so Doai is also known as the Lamp Inn &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ランプの宿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7292_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I found this place while searching around on Google Maps looking for places to hike and explore, and with my friends Dirk and Zach coming to visit in September, we decided to give it a try and stay a night. They have a very modern website which made it easy to reserve a room and the prices were very good compared to other expensive onsens and ryokans. Only 15000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; (~$100) a night, which includes dinner and breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an obnoxious lunch, we arrived around 4pm. There was a bit of confusion on when we were supposed to arrive, but it all worked out. Check-in official began at 3pm, but we could still arive by 5pm. We were sharing the inn with 2 other groups. One group was just a mother and son. The other group was a larger older family of about 6 people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7313_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inn seemed like the perfect size for our 3 groups. I don't know if any of the rooms had names, but we were given the room nearest to the entrance. There were two connected tatami rooms that were opened up so we had a really large space, a total of 20 tatami mats!  The group of 6 had the whole lower wing to themselves, so they probably had probably double the space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some others had already arrived, we were able to hop in the baths first and have them to ourselves before the other groups. Dinner was served around 6:15pm (later than usual), so there was a lot of time to soak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7329_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were separated baths for men and women which alternated in the night and morning. The men had the larger bath in the evening. The baths are kept warm from a wood burning stove underneath, known as the Goemon method. However, heated water from the tap is boiled using electricity from the generator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were two baths available. Both were filled with spring water from the mountain. One was full of water that was naturally heated by the thermals of the mountain. The other was from cool spring water that was manually heated. Both contain the natural minerals that onsen in the mountains are known for, such as sodium bicarbonate (baking soda, essentially). These baths repair and soothe rough skin and cuts by eating away at dead skin on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7331_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love sitting in the warm baths. Natural onsens are my favorite. :) The open window looked out over the gorge with the Tsukechi river below. There were the 3 of us in the bath, so we were talking about things. But, it is always nice to just sit in the bath and listen the wind blow through the leaves and the water flow through the river. There were hot and cold taps for the baths, so I could douse myself with cold water when I felt I was getting too hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was still pretty early out, but it would've been really nice to come back after the sunset and soak in the tub only lit by lantern light. The lanterns keep the insects away, so you could just relax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We stayed in the baths for about 40 minutes and were leaving just as the next group came in. We goofed around in the room for about an hour until the hostess notified everyone of dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7436_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dinner was incredible. Often when dinner is served at an enkai or ryokan, there is usually not enough (for me) to go around. I'm always leave feeling unsatisfied and that I could've had more. This was not the case at Doai. The meal began with mountain vegetables &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山菜&lt;/span&gt;, tofu, mochi, and some Iwana sashimi. Iwana is the most common and prevalent fish in the rivers of these moutanins, and local restaurants often serve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7448_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7445_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More and more dishes kept coming out. We had baked Iwana, tempura, and a very large Gohei mochi. Gohei mochi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;五平餅&lt;/span&gt; is fried mochi on a stick with a sweet syrup sauce painted on the top. They are usually the size of a popsicle, but this beast was larger than most pancakes. It was so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an amazing meal with so much delicious food. One of the best meals I've had in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With dinner finished, we had the lamp and safety demonstration at 7:30pm. I thought that this would take only a couple of minutes so I could be back in the onsen bath before they closed, but the lamp demonstration was only the beginning of the night's activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7466_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arriving in the common area, we were given a puzzle, a wooden needle threaded in a denim jacket. "Remove the needle from the jacket and get a prize!" It seemed pretty easy and I remember seeing a similar looking puzzle on YouTube a while ago where a person removed a bike lock from a lamp post. That was a different solve, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fumbled around at the puzzle until everyone arrived and began the lamp demonstration. The host explained how to correctly light the lamp by achieving the correct flame size after lighting the wick with a match. The two sides of the flame should create an arch when holding the glass above the flame, creating an image that kinda looks like Batman. If the flame is too intense, there's too much wick. The reverse is true too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7468_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that because the wick is completely soaked in oil, it never burns itself. The wick isn't like the wick of a candle. If the flame dies down, it's because of the oil running low, not because the wick is too low. As such, you should never push too much of the wick out of the base. In the short term, you might get the light you want, but after an hour there will be a massive flame burning out of the lantern. ALWAYS make sure the initial lighting creates the batman shape, and the lantern will be fine for the whole night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, when you want to extinguish the flame, don't mess with the wick. Simply blow over the top of the glass and the air circulation will put out the light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were each given our own lantern to light the correct way. The wicks were already in the best position, so we didn't have to mess with it. After striking our match and lighting the wick, we just observed the flame's shape to verify it was correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7481_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, continuing with lighting lanterns, he had us lighting the lamps using the arcane method of flint and steel, the same way his Japanese ancestors like lanterns. We started off with a standard cut of steel against stones. But, if we couldn't handle it, we could use easier steel which guaranteed sparks. Every strike on the flint should try and knock the sparks into some padded cloth, and then attempt to transfer the spark into the lantern to light it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not so easy. I could not get the right angle or I was holding it too hard. I moved on to the easy steel and sparks were flying immediately. Lighting the lantern was so much easier using the "starter" steel. Zach and Dirk were much better at using the true steel method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving on from the lantern, there were many more activities. We continued with the wooden thread puzzle, and he continued to give us more and more hints until we understood how to solve it. Upon solving it, we could keep the wooden needle and as a prize, we were given an extra one to give to a friend. (&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfqqeREGeXUwXPGD_bJXkESB3_WP_0SB/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfqqeREGeXUwXPGD_bJXkESB3_WP_0SB/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;Here's how to solve it&lt;/a&gt;) The host gave us some construction paper with lines to cut out and create a skeleton figure. He also taught us some ways of tying knots using rope, which could help us repel down a cliff or carrying something up. He gave us &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cb8dXIbZxS9hLECKE573H-1SZ9L5MGFN/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cb8dXIbZxS9hLECKE573H-1SZ9L5MGFN/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;more prints of the cutouts and rope instructions.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7498.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7498.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7498_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7498_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7498_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7512.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7512.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7512_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7512_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7512_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The night kept moving with all the activities that it was nearly 10pm. The host said there were more games in the morning, and you can win a prize if you remember how to tie the ropes. But with the generator going off in about 10 minutes, we all retired to our rooms for the night. Each group could take a lantern back to the room to use after lights out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7528_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the generator off, the lanterns were dim, but being out in the pitch darkness of the forest boosted their glow considerably. The hallways filled with the warm light. Although, if we had to use the bathroom, we just used the light on our phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I was alone, I would have loved to fall asleep to the wind in the trees and the water in the river. But, I put in my earphones to guarantee that I could actually sleep through the night without waking from the smallest of sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7531_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The morning came and the light filled our room. It was around 6:30, I think? I heard some odd pinking sound, which I thought was water drops tinking into a thin metal gutter. It was not. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the other family members were in the common area with the host's BB rifle shooting at a tin target in the forest. I went to join them and shot a few rounds. If you called your shot and hit the target within 2 tries, you won a prize, &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7549.jpg"&gt;a compact flint and steel set with some cloth to catch the spark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The baths were open at 7am, so I went back to the room to gather my things for the bath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7540_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We were on the left side now. It was the same layout, except the baths were slightly smaller. It was totally fine though. You don't want to stay in the bath for very long in the morning, otherwise you'll waste all your strength for the day. I think I spent about 15 minutes in the water as others came and went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the common area, more of us gathered to shoot airguns and play with the wooden games he had laid out. Those host asked us if we remembered the knot tying from the previous night. By performing the knot successfully, the prize was a bear bell to use in the forest when hiking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7583_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 8 o'clock, our breakfast was served. More mountain vegetables, Iwana, Miso soup, and other staples of a Japanese breakfast. Plenty of rice, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After breakfast, we continued shooting guns and playing games in the common area and were given &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7626.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7626.jpg"&gt;our bill for our stay&lt;/a&gt;. It was 45900&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; divided between the 3 of us. 15300&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; for one person, which included an amazing dinner, a delicious breakfast, an onsen towel, portable flint/steel, the wooden needle puzzle, a bear bell, and a soak in their onsen is a damn steal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7600.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7600.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7600_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7600_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250914_doai_onsen/IMG_7600_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an incredible stay at a beautiful place that I will forever compare with all my subsequent ryokan stays. I think it would be even better paired with hiking in the area prior to staying the night. After we left, we visited the waterfall just down the road, and also visited the Tsukechi gorge which wasn't too far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see more information on the &lt;a href="https://www.doaionsen.jp/" title="https://www.doaionsen.jp/"&gt;Doai Onsen website&lt;/a&gt;. I also scanned &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zc-zpPhvCMHx4SpnR9xGuJ5T2OVYmu4H/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zc-zpPhvCMHx4SpnR9xGuJ5T2OVYmu4H/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;their brochure&lt;/a&gt; which has some more information. You may notice on their brochure that they have increased prices in the past. Their website currently says that they plan on increasing prices again next year in 2026, but the experience is well worth it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/doai-onsen</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/doai-onsen</link><category/><category/><category>Hida Takayama</category><category/><category>Travel</category><category>Japan</category><category/><category/></item><item><title>The Moon in America</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Since ancient times, when people looked at the moon, they thought they viewed some kind of image on its surface. In European cultures, handed down to America, we had always viewed this image as a face, dubbing it The Man in the Moon. However, in Japanese history (and also China and other Asian countries), they don't see a face. They see a rabbit. Since living here and looking at the moon, I see it, too. It always looks two ears flopped over a crouching body fit into a circle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once read somewhere that claimed part of the difference of opinion was because the angle of moon when viewed in Japan was different when viewed in America. In Japan, the moon was rotated counter-clockwise which put the rabbit's ears up a bit higher, making the rabbit more distinguishable. This seemed like nonsense because Japan and America are on the same latitude. The moon doesn't spin that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night while in America visiting family, there was a beautiful clear night. A few clouds, but the moon is full and illuminated the darkness. I wanted to photograph proof of this difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the American moon shot in August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250807_moon/IMG_5857_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here's the Japanese moon &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/super-moon" title="https://theschlock.com/super-moon"&gt;shot in November 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/161115_super_moon/IMG_0052_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is rotated by quite a bit! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But... this rotation could be because of a lot of things. This is August versus November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's another photo of the Japanese moon &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/september-moon" title="https://theschlock.com/september-moon"&gt;from September 2014&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/140908_moon/IMG_6228.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's rotated even more!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it's not the difference in time of the year, but the time of night? The September shots were from dusk. However, the 2016 and 2025 shots were both taken around 10pm at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the moon really rotated slightly on the other side of Earth even though it's the same hemisphere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This rotation clearly makes it easier to notice a Rabbit in the Moon compared to a Man in the Moon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/the-moon-in-america</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/the-moon-in-america</link><category/><category/><category>America</category><category>Others</category></item><item><title>Minnesota State Capitol</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Over the summer, when I was visiting Minnesota, my sister took me to the state capitol, which I had not visited since childhood. While living in Madison, Wisconsin, I lived near that state capitol and often went by it or inside. I have the layout of that capitol memorized, so it was interesting visiting another state capitol to compare layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though, I think the octogonal layout of the Madison capitol is unique, the features of the St. Paul capitol are still pretty similar with an open hollow area in the middle and each branch of the government splitting off from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In front of the congressional hall were several signs, flowers, and cards paying their respects to Melissa Hortman. She was the Democratic speaker of the house and was assassinated on June 14th, 2025. Because of the political divide in America, no one seemed to care at all. And at this point, I don't think anyone remembers her name without looking it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister, nieces, and I walked around the capitol as I took a bunch of photos. You can see them below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/minnesota-state-capitol</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/minnesota-state-capitol</link><category/><category/><category/><category/><category>America</category><category>Others</category></item><item><title>Wisconsin Veterans Museum</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Next to the state capitol in Madison, Wisconsin is a museum devoted to Wisconsin citizens were who veterans of American wars. There are life-size dioramas of each war with some artifacts and information about Wisconsin's involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I lived in downtown Madison for nearly 6 years, I never went in this museum. This was because I did not care about the American military nor their involvement in domestic and foreign wars. But, having visited the Badger Munitions Factory earlier that day, and also studying more about World War II from Japan's perspective, I wanted to get more insight into the American side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There really wasn't a whole lot of new information here for me. There were some pictures of Japanese residents who were probably forced into the army. But, it was a small section of a much larger exhibit. I think the Vietnam war was the largest section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I played the tourist and took a bunch of photos. You can see them below.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 03:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/wisconsin-veterans-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/wisconsin-veterans-museum</link><category>Madison</category><category/><category>America</category><category>Others</category><category/><category/></item><item><title>Wisconsin State Capitol</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was back in America, I had a brief 8-hour opportunity to explore around Madison, Wisconsin, where I had lived for 6 years. For many of those years, I lived downtown with a group of friends, and nearly every weekend, we would go out to the bars or enjoy some music at a venue. The capitol was always there at the center of town, and we would always walk past it, and sometimes through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, during my brief visit, I played the tourist and took a bunch of pictures. This building does not change, despite the surrounding area having buildings torn down, businesses closed, and more and more homeless and panhandlers on the sidewalks. I haven't been here in nearly 10 years, and it feels like downtown Madison has completely fallen apart.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 02:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/wisconsin-state-capitol</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/wisconsin-state-capitol</link><category/><category/><category>Madison</category><category/><category>America</category><category>Others</category></item><item><title>Widen Enterprises Building</title><description>&lt;p&gt;When I was back in the US, I visited Madison for only a brief 8 hours before moving on. I visited State St and the Square and was shocked at how much the place had fallen apart, due to a combination of Covid and people working from home. Stores were boarded up and gone. They were in the process of tearing down some buildings. And homeless folks were everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were always homeless people in Madison, but they were among the many other people walking around, working, and living in the area. Now, it felt empty and ravaged. I don't think the downtown area of Madison was the only place in America that has fallen apart in recent years. (Visiting the city during a rainstorm probably also contributed to the gloomy atmosphere.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, one of my destinations in Madison was to visit where I used to work, Widen Enterprises. After graduating university, I worked for Widen Enterprises as a Software Developer for over 7 years and then worked abroad for them a litlte bit after coming to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widen Enterprises had a history of print which began in the 40s. They first began detailing and manufacturing plates for newsprint and then broke into catalog printing in the 60s. In the 90s, they invested in developing a user interface and backend that would aid their customers and building these catalogs. This move was perfect syngery with their printing service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with the Internet becoming more and more ubiquitous, print died and their software division grew considerably. During my years of working there, the printing division became smaller and smaller. The basement used to have huge printers for all their costumer's catalogs. As company's workflows moved online, less and less were printing and these printers just took up space. Just after I left, I think the entire print division was disbanded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widen's Digital Asset Management system grew to become their main focus and now it had become their only focus. When I began work there, we occupied half of the top floor. After I left, the building was remodeled and development took over the entire ground floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before the Covid years, I think many developers and staff worked from home at least one day a week. And then during Covid, I think everyone switched to remote working. Not uncommon for companies in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, in September 2021, they sold the company to Acquia. Acquia's main product is a line of content management software for your enterprise website. Having a digital asset management system is powerful tool to allow your costumers to host all their product images and use their software to build their corporate website or commerical website around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the 4 years of ownership and looking at some staff listsing at Acquia, it looks like much of the brilliant excellent folks at Widen have been moved into more senior roles within Acquia. From other rumors, it seems like much of Widen's staff has either been absorbed into other areas of Acquia or left the company altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4438_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the old Widen building is for sale. It is no longer used by any developers or staff still working on DAM, wherever they may be. I think Widen had been at this location since the late 60s or 70s? Some of the other print buildings in the area still look like they're in business. It seems like a blight to have one of the major businesses in the area gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone had recently mowed the lawn, so it doesn't look too bad. But there are still some overgrown plants around the parking lot. Nobody comes here. (The overgrowth is much more present on Google Street View.) I'm not sure when they sold the building. Maybe it was still being used in late 2023?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250731_02_widen/IMG_4430_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I was in the US, I drove past many corporate buildings and businesses that were completely empty because of the workforce moving online. I'm not a fan of working from home, but my commute to work is only 5 minutes in this dense mountain town. If I had to drive 45 minutes to work every day in a dense metro traffic, I would probably prefer working from home, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While everything feels like it's falling apart in the states, I think it's a consequence of transitioning the next (or another) form of our society. And change hurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still &lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/toys-r-us-is-dead" title="https://theschlock.com/toys-r-us-is-dead"&gt;sucks that another one of my former workplaces is gone.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 31 Jul 2025 01:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/widen-enterprises-building</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/widen-enterprises-building</link><category>Madison</category><category/><category>Updates</category><category>America</category><category>Others</category></item><item><title>St Croix River Riverboat</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Stillwater is a classic midwestern city that tries its best to embrace its Minnesotan and Wisconsin history. The downtown area still keeps its flat storefront image, and one of the key features of the town is the vertically lifting bridge over the St. Croix River. To keep with its traditional roots, a company still offers rides of Riverboats that travel up and down the river.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My mother and I met up with my sister for a hot afternoon to try the experience. I think a lot of people tend to use the riverboat as an excuse to drink and have some decent food. But everything is so expensive these days.

There are Deluxe Edition figures which have painted details released as blind boxes for 1650&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. And, there are "Simple" ones, released as a Capsule figure for 500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; each. I found these while I was in Toyama to see Superman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2602.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2602.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2602_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2602_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2602_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capsule machine will mostly full, but there were a few people around getting their coins ready for a pull, including one guy who excitedly got all 3 different figures in only 3 pulls!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turned the crank and got the Fruit Roll-Up color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2610.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2610.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2610_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2610_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2610_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3 colors available were translucent black, translucent red, and glow-in-the-dark. I think I would've prefered the glow-in-the-dark version for the novelty, but fruit snack red was a close second. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the capsule there was an advertisment showing the different colors and some very obtuse instructions on how to assemble the figure. It wasn't difficult to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://theschlock.com/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2632.jpg" title="https://theschlock.com/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2632.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2632_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2632_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/250712_08_ludens/IMG_2632_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annoying that the flag is bent. The figure looks so chewable, but it's pretty solid and sturdy once put together. Not sturdy enough to withstand the Japanese summer heat sitting in a box somewhere for a few weeks, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it's fun for a 500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; pull, but certainly not worth the 1650&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; for the Deluxe figures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jul 2025 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/kojima-ludens-capsule-figure</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/kojima-ludens-capsule-figure</link><category/><category/><category/><category>Toys</category><category>Media</category><category>Games</category></item><item><title>Abandoned Sorei Settlement 草嶺集落</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Further north of the Toga town area, and past Kitamamedani and the former Oshiba settlement, there is another small area of former farms known as the Sorei settlement.
