I instantly fell in love with this film when I saw it for the first time 7 years ago. I had been living in a foreign country for almost 5 years at that point teaching English, so I felt like it spoke to me directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since I saw this film, I wanted to tell my students about it, and I had the chance the next week at my junior high school. &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/arrival" title="http://theschlock.com/arrival"&gt;Here's that post&lt;/a&gt;. Since starting high school, I wanted to use it again in a much larger capacity. And I finally accomplished that this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the film, we discussed the overall story and ideas before focusing on the theory of "switching brains" when using different languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film begins with Louise (played by Amy Adams) narrating life to her daughter. The joy of her birth to the pain of her unexpected premature death. A person's life is often defined by moments outside of their control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h39m16s897_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Louise arrives at her university to teach a class about language, life is interrupted by alien spacecraft appearing in 12 locations in different countries throughout the world. There is no announcement from the spaceships, but every 18 hours, a chamber is opened allowing people to enter and have contact with the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the chaos, Louise is contacted by U.S. Army Colonel Weber (Forrest Whitaker) asking for her help to translate a message from the aliens. Impossible from just a recording, she, Weber, and Physicist Ian Donnely (Jeremy Renner) travel to Montana to the spaceship. They meet the aliens, but ultimately have no physical commonality to bridge communication. The aliens sound more like animals to us rather than sentient beings. (End of Part 1 in class)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise hits a breakthrough when she uses a whiteboard to write our language and show it to the aliens. Having a visual representation of our language allows the aliens to understand and reciprocate with their written language. This also allows Louise to have a tangible and concrete connection from their language to ours, given her a starting point to begin a rough method of translation and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h57m09s565_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-10h58m14s439_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise and Ian live at the army camp and spend every waking minute working on a method of translating the alien language. Every time the alien craft opens, Louse and Ian enter, and do their best to communicate with the aliens. From the written sentences, they build vocabulary and grammar, and they also build a device that can replicate the alien sentences and show them to the aliens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weeks have passed. They are finally near the point of being able to ask them, "What is the purpose of your visit?" They ask the question and get a response which translates to "Offer Weapon." This response creates conflict between Louise's team and the military execs who never fully trusted the aliens. (End of Part 2 in class)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m56s259.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m56s259.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m56s259_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m56s259_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m56s259_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language is Messy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a 2-word response to such a large question is bound to have some errors, particularly in English. Looking through an English dictionary will give you plenty of words that roughly mean the same thing with small subtle differences. For anyone who has never thought about it before, these differences are often hard to identify, too. Like, what's the difference between &lt;i&gt;talk&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;speak&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;hear&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;listen&lt;/i&gt;? Any English speakers can tell you that these words have different meanings and uses, but can you clearly explain why they're different?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, these subtle differences are being translated into another language and back. The words of a language carry more than just their meaning. The meanings are often derived from the lineage of the country's culture, and their usage is determined from the society that came from that culture. When the society and culture of two languages are completely separate with completely separate pasts and values, you lose a lot in translation and need more context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spoke to me directly being an American teaching English in Japan. English and Japanese are two of the most distant languages on Earth. At the base level, our writing, alphabet, grammar, and vocabulary are totally different. But, going up one level, our languages are also separated by different pasts and cultures which have created words used in completely different settings with different weights. To go from one language to the other requires more knowledge than just a dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, multiply this idea by another dimension to try and make contact with an alien species whose planet, biology, and even perception of reality are completely foreign to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h26m55s802_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Language from Culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let's look at two specific sentences in Japanese and English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;I watch TV at home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;私は家でテレビを見ます。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order of English grammar has the subject, verb, and predicate of the sentence in that order. The Japanese sentence starts with the subject, but it ends with the verb. All the further details of the sentence are given before closing with the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think English is a very &lt;b&gt;direct&lt;/b&gt; language. With any sentence, we immediately state the information of &lt;b&gt;who&lt;/b&gt; does &lt;b&gt;what&lt;/b&gt;. Any other information that builds context to that situation is given after. That information is of secondary importance. Most European languages follows this same pattern, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout history, European nations have focused on outward expansion and conquering. Greeks and Romans, then English, Spanish, and Portuguese through the world, then Americans in North America. Through our history of conflict and war, we have more aggressive and direct personalities, which is reflected in our direct language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese language is the near opposite. Grammatically, the action is stated last. Their sentences care more about the details of the situation before deciding on the action. Because of this, Japanese is often described as an &lt;b&gt;indirect&lt;/b&gt; language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This also comes from history. Japan is a small island, and it didn't take long for all available space to be taken. Villages and settlements of people had nowhere to expand. If someone was exiled from a village, they couldn't make their own village. They would have to be accepted by another village, but that village would be suspicious of why they were exiled in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People needed a way to work together and not cause conflict. Direct language is often harsh, so their communication became soft and less direct, creating a more gentle and nice society. The Japanese language we have today came from these early ideals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both cases, our histories and culture are reflected in the language we use today. This is also true with the alien's language in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h21m38s941_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immersion / "Switching Brains"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise is often able to read the alien sentences without using their translation device. Knowing about the small subtle differences in language, every small variation in the alien sentences brings up questions about why. Why is this different? What does this mean? How does this compare to a previous sentence with the same mark? Every day, she asks these questions to herself as she studies their language and refines their translations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This immersion also brings about stress. She doesn't get a lot of sleep, so she often daydreams about her daughter. Ian notices this, and asks her about her dream. "When you dream, are you able to dream in their language?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This overall immersion is the center of Arrival's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m23s049_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian mentions that when you immerse yourself in a foreign language, you're able to rewire your brain to think in that language. People usually refer to this as "switching brains." When someone truly learns a language, they live it. They think in that language and can respond naturally in that language without ever using or thinking about their native language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, as people think and speak that foreign language, their personality can change to fit the culture of that language. As an example, I tend to speak softer when using Japanese and louder when using English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the film, as Louise uses the alien language, and thinks in the alien language, she has also slowly adapted to the culture of the aliens without realizing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h35m00s319_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h32m32s390_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Time&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alien sentence has no beginning and end, and it's written all at once without any order. This is completely different than any language on Earth. All of our sentences have a specific order. The components of the sentences might have a different order, but there's always a beginning and end, and language is also spoken in that same order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The alien language becomes a visual representation for their perception of reality because their perception of time also has no beginning or end. An alien views their entire life all at once. As they live in their present, they also live in their past and their future. They know all of the events that will happen in their life as they live them simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Louise studied the language, she slowly gained this perception through the daydreams of her daughter, who is not born yet. Her daughter is born in the future, after Louise and Ian marry following the events of the film, after the aliens leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her immersion and adaptation of the alien language allowed her to think like the aliens, who have no concept of linear time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-12h01m22s048_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essay Topic 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first attempt at using Arrival for my writing class focused on this Immersion only. Students wrote an essay answering the question: &lt;b&gt;Is immersion necessary to completely understand a subject?&lt;/b&gt; Through Louise immersing herself in the alien language, she could completely understand it and adapt to their way of thinking. In general, was this really necessary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was fine, but the result of that immersion is more important. I think it's a more interesting question to ask whether it is possible to "switch brains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In more definitive terms, The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis explains the idea of "switching brains." As a foundation, the hypothesis states that every language has a culture behind it, and this language and culture creates a thought process and view of the world for the people of that language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m27s359.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m27s359.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m27s359_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m27s359_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m27s359_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m35s958.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m35s958.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m35s958_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m35s958_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h22m35s958_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea is split into two opposing theories: &lt;b&gt;Linguistic Relativity&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Linguistic Determinism&lt;/b&gt;. Usually when people mention the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, there are referring to Linguistic Relativity. This is what Ian Donnelly does in the film. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linguistic Relativity&lt;/b&gt; means that when you learn and immerse yourself in a new language, you can also learn and change to the thought process of that language. When people "switch brains" to use a foreign language, they're also thinking like the people from that country and can view the world and situations in the same way. A person's thinking can change &lt;u&gt;relative&lt;/u&gt; to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Linguistic Determinism&lt;/b&gt; is the opposite. A person's thought process and view of the world is &lt;u&gt;determined&lt;/u&gt; by their native language, or primary language. They can still learn new languages, but their thoughts and actions will always be influenced by their native language and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essay Topic 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese students spend a long time learning English in school. Their first classes are in elementary school, and become more numerous through junior high and senior high school. Even so, there's still a gap between our languages that prevents general students from becoming totally fluent. Many of the students still stick to the fundamentals of Japanese culture. As such, students don't have a clear linguistic foundation to truly answer whether Linguistic Relativity or Linguistic Determinism is more correct because they've never been able to immerse themselves in a different language or culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, school is an overwhelming part of their lives, especially at my school. Students who take my writing course have classes for 12 hours each weekday, and another 6 or 8 hours on Saturdays. All of their time is spent studying and doing work for school. So, instead of language, what about different school subjects? Students who are often good at math are often not good at humanities, such as English or Japanese. The reverse is true, too. So, students answer the following question for the current essay:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Which is more correct: the idea of Cognitive Relativity or Cognitive Determinism?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the Hypothesis states that different school subjects have different ways of thinking. For example, in math class, questions only have one answer and have a logically way of finding that answer. A student learns about formulas and methods of deriving that answer. For language class, the method of thinking is totally different. Language requires thinking that is far more fluid. There isn't a single way of answering a question, and answers can sometimes be long or short depending on the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So for &lt;b&gt;Cognitive Relativity&lt;/b&gt;, when students focus and immerse themselves in various subjects, they are able to change their thinking to match the thought process of subject. And for &lt;b&gt;Cognitive Determinism&lt;/b&gt;, students have a best subject or a favorite subject, and because they feel most confident in that subject, it ultimately determines how they think. When studying their weak subjects, they want to use the thought process of their strong subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is it possibly for people to "switch their brains" when studying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h11m52s231_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Essay Writing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The essay follows the 4-paragraph structure of having an Introduction, Body, and Conclusion. The &lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt; introduces the film, its story, and the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis. It finishes by posing the above question &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt;. The question is not answered first; it's answered last, in the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two paragraphs in the &lt;b&gt;Body&lt;/b&gt;, which typically provide reasons for the answer, look at both sides of the argument. One paragraph focuses on &lt;b&gt;Cognitive Relatively&lt;/b&gt; and how the student can change their thinking when focusing on different subjects. The other paragraph focuses on &lt;b&gt;Cognitive Determinism&lt;/b&gt; and how it's difficult for students to focus on or understand subjects they aren't good at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;, having looked at both sides of the question, students make a decision on which is more correct. They show why their opinion is true and why the opposite is false. The essay is concluded with a positive statement about the future. What good things will happen in the future if people understood your idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the overall essay structure: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f__nTSmGOkpSRFfPuwdenluPgW5GQXMR/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f__nTSmGOkpSRFfPuwdenluPgW5GQXMR/view"&gt;gdrive/Arrival - Essay Structure.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the class is taught once a week, the movie and explanation could take a month. Each paragraph also takes a month. There's also summer vacation, which is another month. Students write their paragraphs in their notebook and I check them for errors in their contents, like weak or missing explanations. Paragraphs are only finished when I've marked them with an "okay." With all paragraphs complete, students will type their paragraph in a Google Document and create an APA-style report, which follows &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fe0TK5KawBZIWQMZhKq836d0NekSl5h0/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fe0TK5KawBZIWQMZhKq836d0NekSl5h0/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;this format&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, class takes about 7 or 8 months. That seems like a long time to write a 3-4 page essay, but Japanese students have never written anything like this before. Many of them will never write something like this again because they'll focus on something else in university. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of all the work they put into this essay, I print them out and put them in rail files, just like an American University. I'm proud of all the work they've done, so I want them to be proud of it, too, and have something to keep and hold from their experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/IMG_8429_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of student work, with the cover page removed: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fewLzExX3HbqIFMPrzO6WbyAuTlS5bxn/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fewLzExX3HbqIFMPrzO6WbyAuTlS5bxn/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fkj5YhLVRNNmgCWkMP0S3_bHaRbCtWHJ/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fkj5YhLVRNNmgCWkMP0S3_bHaRbCtWHJ/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fks3eYxoHfL610cXayajQMmKpZqgd5UI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fks3eYxoHfL610cXayajQMmKpZqgd5UI/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With enough time remaining before finals, students can use their essays in a Japanese English debate style format. The class is divided into two teams based on how they're answered the question in their essay. Relativity v. Determinism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In teams, they discuss their essays and come up with the 3 best reasons for why their opinion is correct. These 3 reasons are spoken by group members as their &lt;b&gt;Opening Statement&lt;/b&gt;. Each team gives their opening statement, and the other team takes notes of the opening statement for the next part. (I also write them on the board and online for students to review.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is the &lt;b&gt;Attack&lt;/b&gt;. After receiving the other team's 3 best points, teams come back together and discuss why the opposing team's reasons are not true. Each best point should have a team member attacking it. After discussion, each team will give their Attack speeches, and the other teams will take notes. (I write these down, too.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next is the &lt;b&gt;Defense&lt;/b&gt;, which works a lot like the Attack. After receiving the opposing team's attack, teams discuss why that attack was weak or incorrect and reinforce their best points. The Defense does not reinforce their own attacks. After discussion, once again, each team will have its members deliver the Defense speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this debate format, there's a final speech called the &lt;b&gt;Summary Speech&lt;/b&gt;. Teams would give a speech stating their best points, why the best points of the opposing team were wrong, how the opposing team didn't correctly defend their points, and how their team correctly defending their own points. It's a bit much for students to do all of this for the first time, so I do the summary for them as a way of concluding the class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/arrival-2/vlcsnap-2023-03-24-11h58m07s723_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, students are evaluated on their progress of writing the essay in their notebooks and meeting deadlines. The final report is harshly graded by any mistakes in print, and also being turned in on-time. By the end, everything should be perfect, so any mistakes are made through carelessness of typing of putting together their report. My class's overall grade this year was 95%, so it all worked out. Only one student got a B, which brought down the average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I've had this film on my mind for 8 years since its release, but I think I can finally put it down after this last year of explaining it, reading about it, and writing about it again and again.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/arrival-and-language</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/arrival-and-language</link><category>Film &amp; TV</category><category>Media</category><category>Teaching</category></item><item><title>Nintendo Controller Button Set</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Exclusive at Nintendo Stores in Japan are oversized Gatcha machines with a set of toys called the Controller Button Collection &lt;span class='ja'&gt;コントローラーボタンコレクション&lt;/span&gt;. Set 1 was released last year and focused on the original Famicom and NES. Over the summer, Nintendo released Set 2, which included Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, and Gamecube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8397_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pull costs 600&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Because of the demand in summer, you would buy 1 or 2 tickets at a time, each for a pull. In July, I met some friends in Tokyo, and we went back and forth between buying tickets and hitting the button on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My main goal was getting both Super Nintendo and Super Famicom controllers. I did a total of 6 pulls, and got some duplicates. My friends were more fortunate with their duplicates, so after some trading, I was able to get most of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8414_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm only missing the c-stick from the Gamecube controller. (But, I ordered one from Yahoo Auctions to complete the set)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These things are pretty amazing. They are near-perfect replicas of classic Nintendo controllers, which seem to use the same molds as the originals? Actually, Nintendo is probably using the same molds and plastics for their recent releases of the classic controllers on the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside are the same membranes used for the controllers too. There's a big plastic slab instead of a pcb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8427_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I posted this now because I was in Kanazawa over the weekend with a student, and we stumbled upon a pop-up Nintendo Store. Out front, they had 3 gatcha machines: Button Set 1, Button Set 2, and the Zonai Gear Magnet set, which was apparently an exclusive pre-release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zonai Gear are from Zelda Tears of the Kingdom, but they looked pretty crappy and low quality compared to the controllers. Typical gatcha garbage. Skip. I did one pull of the Button Set 2 for another chance at the one I was missing, or another Super Nintendo one. I pulled the Nintendo 64 buttons. Another whammy. They kids after me also pulled the same buttons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241201_nintendo/IMG_8387_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, these toys are really neat as a novelty. You could hang them from your bag, or maybe put them in your car. They aren't really useful otherwise, and don't necessarily display all that well either. But, it's fun to feel the buttons and control stick of the original controllers without having an original controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely worth a pull or two if you're able.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/nintendo-controller-button-set</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/nintendo-controller-button-set</link><category>Games</category><category>Toys</category></item><item><title>Takayama Photo Rogaining</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A month ago, a friend sent me a message about a Photo Rogaining &lt;span class='ja'&gt;フォトロゲイニング&lt;/span&gt; event in my town. Photo Rogaining is a somewhat new sport that combines photography and running. It's like a photo scavenger hunt, except you are giving specific locations where to take the photos. The challenge is, by having no prior knowledge of the locations, you must quickly determine a route to reach as many checkpoints as possible, each checkpoint having different point values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to his message, I had no idea what this was. &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ロゲイニング&lt;/span&gt;? I could not figure out the English word this was trying to be. Logging? Photo Logging? But, Photo Rogaining is the correct English. Rogaining as a sport began in Australia. Its first event was in the 70s. The name Rogaining comes from the 3 folks who invented it: Rod, Gail, and Neil. They just combined their names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8265_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full title of the event was &lt;b&gt;Hida Takayama Photo Rogaining - Celebrating the 500th Birthday of Nagachika Kanamori&lt;/b&gt; -&lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森長近生誕&lt;/span&gt;500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;年記念&lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨高山フォトロゲイニング&lt;/span&gt;. Kanamori is a very special historical figure for the town. We have a statue of him in the Castle Park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of the Kanamori Clan, Nagachika led his troops as an arm of the Tokugawa Clan and conquered northern Gifu and eventually Toyama, Ishikawa, and Fukui. Becoming the daimyo of the area, Kanamori transformed Takayama into a small-sized castle town to encourage tourism of other rich lords. He established what would become modern day Takayama. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the event commemorates the 500th anniversary of his birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8242_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Takayama event was advertised around town a little bit. The starting point as well as the main venue was the Takayama City Historical Museum downtown. The poster had a link to the website for more information: &lt;a href="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/" title="https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/"&gt;https://photorogaining.com/event/3862/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were 6 different categories of participants: Family Team, Men's Team, Women's Team, Mixed Team, Men's Solo, and Women's Solo. The event had a limit of 100 entrees, but we only had around 40 people total? A few didn't show up, but overall I don't think the event was advertised all that well. I'm really glad my friend sent me the info.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friend joined a team with his daughter. There were 3 or 4 family teams. The biggest category was the Mixed Teams with 9 separate teams competing. The second biggest category was my category, Men's Solo. We had 6 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The schedule was as follows:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;11:00&lt;/b&gt; - Reception&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;12:00&lt;/b&gt; - Start&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;15:00&lt;/b&gt; - Finish&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;15:30&lt;/b&gt; - Awards Ceremony&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rules&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the Japanese Photo Rogaining site, they listed some general rules. It was not exhaustive, so I didn't completely understand everything. Through the course of the event, I was able to understand the rules better, and now I have a much better grasp of what I could've done to place higher than I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reception for the event was 11am at the museum. At check-in, we got our bib, number, and a packet with our map, which we were not allowed to open yet. Around 11:30am, they began explaining all the rules for the event. Again, I would've preferred they had all the rules clearly listed, so I could've double checked everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 11:50am, 10 minutes prior to the start, we could open our maps and look at all of the objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a6J5tz_b2LS9NelvnLodU58ywUpHdEAh/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-map.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a1uPrhtQYvtJ0ZmL-YQqlo0IxkV5rkM9/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/takayama-rogaining-checkpoints.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several points on the map were ones I had guessed earlier, but I had no idea it would push out as far as &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="http://theschlock.com/matsukura-and-emaichi"&gt;Matsukura Kanon and Matsukura Castle ruins&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, it's only 5 or 6km away. Normally isn't that far, but both of these are on the top of a mountain. Steep vertical ascents in a marathon are rough. On the other hand...  63 and 65 points are really high values, along with 43 and 47 on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't have a lot of time to think or compare this to the other points. I know that I wanted to climb up Shiroyama (castle park) for those points. So, my plan was to get some nearby points, go up Shiroyama for those points, and then push off west for Hida no Sato at least. On my return, I would keep north to grab all of those points before the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Start&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the event began, one of the Solo guys immediately bolted to the stoplight and then west. I kept up with him to the stoplight, but I was going east. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I grabbed a photo of the rock wall leading up the hill, &lt;b&gt;Point 1&lt;/b&gt;, labeled as &lt;span class='ja'&gt;えび坂のお多福&lt;/span&gt;. Further east, I snapped a photo of this small park, &lt;b&gt;Point 14&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;川上別邸史跡公園&lt;/span&gt;, Kawakami's Historical Second Home park?, on the way to the Bell Tower at Soyu-ji Temple, &lt;b&gt;Point 31&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;宗猷寺鐘堂&lt;/span&gt;.

Looking back now, I really should've kept going west to grab Point 46, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;道分灯篭&lt;/span&gt;. It really wasn't that far away, and those 46 points would've been crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting my climb of Shiroyama, I grabbed a photo of an outer gate of the Kogane Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;黄金神社&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 7&lt;/b&gt;. Behind the shrine is a hiking path that goes directly up to Shiroyama Park &lt;span class='ja'&gt;城山公園&lt;/span&gt;. I'm not sure too many people knew about that. Way faster than taking the road. In the center of Shiroyama Park is the bronze statue of Kanamori, &lt;b&gt;Point 24&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;長近銅像&lt;/span&gt;. This is also where I parked my car. I dumped all my extra packet stuff in my car, and continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before taking the path up to the Takayama Castle Ruins, I quickly ran over to the nearby Shoren-ji Temple &lt;span class='ja'&gt;照蓮寺&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 18&lt;/b&gt;. The path going up the mountain is pretty steep. Stair, after stair. It's not so bad if you're hiking normally, but in a race, it's rough. I reached the Takayama Castle Ruins &lt;span class='ja'&gt;高山城跡&lt;/span&gt;, main building &lt;span class='ja'&gt;本丸跡&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 23&lt;/b&gt;, at 12:25pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="fourColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8259_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8264_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8268_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column fourColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8272_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 → 24 → 18 → 23 // (+72 points / 118 total)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are hiking trails that spider-web themselves throughout Shiroyama.

It took me around 5 minutes to figure out the correct vantage point of the photo. (Later, I learned that getting an accurate photo didn't matter :/ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Hie Shrine, I ran north along the river to grab &lt;b&gt;Point 44&lt;/b&gt; at Masugata Bridge &lt;span class='ja'&gt;枡形橋&lt;/span&gt;. Ippon-Sugi Hakusan Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;一本杉白山神社&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 29&lt;/b&gt; was a quick run away. Then, a little bit of backtracking to snap a photo of Yamaoka's statue, &lt;b&gt;Point 30&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山岡鉄舟像&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="fourColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8281.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8281.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8281_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8281_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8281_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8288.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8288.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8288_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8288_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8288_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8290.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8290.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8290_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8290_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8290_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column fourColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8295.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8295.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8295_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;32 → 44 → 29 → 30 // (+135 points / 253 total)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time was almost 1pm. I grabbed quite a lot of points in a short amount of time, but now it was time to push out to the west towards Hida no Sato and Matsukura. It took about 15 minutes to run to Kinryu Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金龍神社&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;b&gt;Point 43&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the time around 1:20, I considered whether I would be able to make it to Hida no Sato and still have time to grab all the other points downtown. Eh, I pushed up the hill anyways, and reached Hida no Sato &lt;span class='ja'&gt;飛騨の里&lt;/span&gt; in about 13 minutes. &lt;b&gt;Point 47&lt;/b&gt;, easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8300.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8300.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8300_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8300_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8300_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8306.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8306.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8306_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8306_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8306_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;43 → 47 // (+90 points / 343 total)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being at the door step of Mt. Matsukura, I could've pushed further to reach points 63 and 65, but the climb up the mountain was a lot, and after already going up and down Shiroyama, I didn't really consider it possibly to get up there and back. Looking back now, it really didn't take much to get Hida no Sato from Kiyryu Shrine. Maybe I could've grabbed Matsukura, but there were closer points that I should've grabbed instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran down the direct road going North back to 472. I cut through some of the neighborhoods and reached the next location. Next to the Tsujigamorisan Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;辻ヶ森三神社&lt;/span&gt; are the ruins of a temple, the Kokubun Nunnery Temple &lt;span class='ja'&gt;国分尼寺金堂跡&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 26&lt;/b&gt;. From there, I continued straight downtown to the main Kokubun-ji Temple, &lt;b&gt;Point 13&lt;/b&gt;. Then, a little north towards Hachiman Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;櫻山八幡宮&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 28&lt;/b&gt;, but snapping a photo of the Ecchu Kaido Monument &lt;span class='ja'&gt;越中街道碑&lt;/span&gt;, on the street, &lt;b&gt;Point 35&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not on the list, but I also snapped a photo of the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8320.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8320.jpg"&gt;Pokemon Manhole Cover&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="fourColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8310.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8310.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8310_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8310_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8310_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8316.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8316.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8316_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8316_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8316_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8321.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8321.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8321_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8321_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8321_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column fourColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8326.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8326.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8326_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8326_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8326_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;26 → 13 → 35 → 28 // (+102 points / 445 total)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was now 2pm, only an hour left of the event.

Then a dash up the nearby hill to snap a photo of the Sakura Bell Gate for the Unryu-ji Temple &lt;span class='ja'&gt;雲龍寺鐘桜門&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 21&lt;/b&gt;. A rough stair climb up to Higashiyama Hakusan Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;東山白山神社&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 42&lt;/b&gt;.

I probably wasted 5 minutes and some energy before finding some nearby signs and looking at where I was supposed to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Point 11&lt;/b&gt; is the grave site of Kanamori, &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森家の墓跡&lt;/span&gt; and there were signs pointing to the location within the graveyard. I had finally found it. Then, taking this dirt path behind the Temple led me to the lantern I was looking for, the front of Sogen-ji Temple &lt;span class='ja'&gt;素玄寺本堂&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 19&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was 2:30pm, but it felt a lot later. After being tired from running around all afternoon, I felt like I was done. I hadn't planned on going anywhere else, anyway, so it was a quick stop at the library, Kanshoukan &lt;span class='ja'&gt;煥章館&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Point 5&lt;/b&gt;, and then back to the museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8344.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8344.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8344_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8344_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8344_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8347.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8347.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8347_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8347_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8347_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8351.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8351.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8351_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;11 → 19 → 5 // (+35 points / 573 total)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arrived back to base with 17 minutes left, cold and tired. 17 minutes is a lot of time, but there wasn't anything near enough to make a 17-minute round trip. I was done. I thought I did pretty well, though. I captured a ton of checkpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8353.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8353.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8353.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8353.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8353.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scoring&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you returned, you are given a &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_xZehm1Ti1LwRKPeJt-5-aFzVQwINVHk/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_xZehm1Ti1LwRKPeJt-5-aFzVQwINVHk/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;Score Card&lt;/a&gt;, and you start tabulating your points. Some of the judges were watching me because I was one of the only ones back, but scoring was almost all done on an individual basis. People wrote down there own stuff, and posted their sheet on the wall without anyone double-checking anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, I noticed and began understanding a few additional rules. You could receive up 20 bonus points for each photo of the word Kanamori Nagachika &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森長近&lt;/span&gt; you took in addition to the checkpoints. Each photo would give 1 bonus point. Additionally, if you arrived late, you would be deducted 30 points every minute, up to 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I probably ran past a few places with the Kanamori Nagachika written somewhere. The statue in the park more than likely had his name written on it. The Castle Ruins and probably a few other places with a written description may have had his name, too. You may not think a few bonus points would be helpful, but it could've made a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, my total was &lt;b&gt;573 points&lt;/b&gt; from all the tabulations above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the race, this one guy bolted off west to Matsukura. I saw him later as I was coming back from Hida no Sato. He still had a ton of energy 2 hours into the event. After seeing his score card, not only did he grab both Matsukura locations, but he also ran north up the hill by the highway to grab those distant points, too. Absolutely incredible. His final score was &lt;b&gt;734 points&lt;/b&gt;. Far beyond mine. This is a pro score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other solos began posting their scores. &lt;b&gt;577 points&lt;/b&gt;. Damn! So close. Bumped down to third by only 4 points. Then, &lt;b&gt;531 points&lt;/b&gt;. Phew, not last. Then, &lt;b&gt;578 points&lt;/b&gt;. Ah dang. Now, I'm bumped out of the top 3, again by only a few points. Last, was &lt;b&gt;353 points&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8376.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8376.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8376_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8376_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8376_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8378.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8378.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8378_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8378_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241130_photo_rogaining/IMG_8378_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I missed second place by only 6 points! (Or 5 points for a tie)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those couple of bonus points really could've made a difference. Pushing out to Point 46 would've made a huge difference. Also, not trying to take the perfect picture would've made a difference, too. I spent about 5-10 minutes at some locations trying to get the best photo. That bit of extra time could've given me more confidence about running off to 46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, I could've skipped other places downtown in lieu of grabbing the really high-point locations. By hitting the far away, high-point totals first, once I returned downtown, I could've decided whether or not to sacrifice certain spots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having gone through the event, I've been thinking a lot about better strategies and how to improve my score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really want to try again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rogaining Events&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of what made this event great was being able to compete on my home turf. I knew exactly where almost all the locations were by having native knowledge of the area. I've already been to all these places on my own by jogging, running other marathons, or playing Pokemon Go. Prior to the event, I had a good idea where a lot of these locations would be, so I had a good mental image of what I would do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the event, they gave out a &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_sYyvE3_Yx-m-Pv5A--1ou_Yqhfr-wPC/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_sYyvE3_Yx-m-Pv5A--1ou_Yqhfr-wPC/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;flyer&lt;/a&gt; with some more events. I have no idea if they'll be run the same way as this one, but I'm game to try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just need to find one that's (1) allows solo participants, (2) not too far away, and (3) not too long. Unless I start doing more training, I think 3 hours is my limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I loved this event so much. This is my new favorite sport. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Dec 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/takayama-photo-rogaining</link><category>Running</category><category>Hida Takayama</category><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>Pokemon Snap</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Pokemon Snap is a game that everyone remember fondly. Originally released in 1999 for the Nintendo 64, it immediately became a fan favorite leveraging the rise of Pokemon fandom throughout the world, and having very unique gameplay that was very easy to learn and understand, and matched the franchise so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/pokemon_snap/Screenshot_2024-11-16_12-38-22_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Pokemon Snap, you are positioned in an automated vehicle with a camera. Your goal is to take good-looking photos of all the various Pokemon in the environment. After you complete a level, you choose one photo to represent each Pokemon species you find. Photos are scored and after various goal posts, more levels and equipment are unlocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, I've been a bit burnt out, so I wanted to spend some time with a game. Just like everyone else, I have fond memories of Pokemon Snap, too. As I started playing the game around 9am, I didn't think I would play through the entire game, completing the Photo-dex before Noon. Man, it is really short. Some games from 20 and 30 years ago felt so big and massive back then. Taking photos freely in an environment feels like something so expansive and never ending. Not even 3 hours is pretty crazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the complete opposite of recent sequel, released in 2021. &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/new-pokemon-snap" title="http://theschlock.com/new-pokemon-snap"&gt;New Pokemon Snap&lt;/a&gt; doesn't have a million levels, nor access to all 1000 pokemon, but the amount of replayability from altering course tracks, finding signature photo opportunities of each pokemon, and even secret Pokemon, pushes the game in the opposite direction where there is too much to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, it was a fun Saturday morning game. While 3 hours is pretty short, it doesn't over stay its welcome. Below are all of my best photos from my play through. Unfortunately, the Mister N64 core doesn't allow screenshots, so these were done through OBS.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 16 Nov 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/pokemon-snap</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/pokemon-snap</link><category>Games</category><category>Pokemon</category></item><item><title>Ghibli Park</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Nearly two years ago, Ghibli Park was first opened in the Aichi Commemorative Expo Park, northeast of Nagoya. Ghibli Park is an open-air museum of sorts, with replica houses, buildings, and environments from various works by Ghibli Film. In the center of it all, is the Ghibli Warehouse, which houses a museum, other exhibits, a theater, shops, and several other recreations of Ghibli works and history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four open-air areas of the Ghibli Park, each require an advanced ticket to enter. Each area is spread around the Expo Park. Here's a map:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q-sL6TRDRArI8eX7x01ckPJoRvNpPZ-n/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/ghibli/oosanpo_map.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the &lt;span class="orange"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ghibli Warehouse &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ジブリの大倉庫&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the middle, the &lt;span class="light_blue"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hill of Youth &lt;span class='ja'&gt;青春の丘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is near one of the main parking lots and the train station in the north. It's most likely the first area you'll come across. Near the other parking lot and to the south is &lt;span class="olive"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dondoko Forest &lt;span class='ja'&gt;どんどの森&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. These were the first areas available when Ghibli Park first opened on November 1st, 2022. Since then, in November 2023, the &lt;span class="purple"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mononoke Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;もののけの里&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the northeast was completed. And most centralized and most recently opened in March 2024 is the &lt;span class="magenta"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Valley of Witches &lt;span class='ja'&gt;魔女の谷&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my friends visited the park a year or more ago, and said it wasn't all that special, but this is absolutely not the case. Seeing the scale of these areas in person is incredible. Climbing to the scenic lookout point, prior to the park's opening, and peering down at a life-size replica of Howl's Moving Castle brought up feelings that I didn't know I had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5815_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAMN. That's it. That's fricken it! The madmen did it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tickets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tickets for the Ghibli Park are all purchased in advance, online through Lawson. There are 4 different types of tickets available, with different levels of access to the park. The main tickets are purchases 2 months in advance, but there are last-minute tickets you can buy within 7 days prior to visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard ticket is the Grand Sanpo Pass, or Grand Walking Pass. This pass allows entrance to all four outdoor areas of Ghibli Park, and gives a specific entrance time to the Ghibli Warehouse. When you buy the ticket, the time you're choosing is when you can enter the Warehouse. You can enter any of the outside areas at anytime throughout the day. Tickets are 3500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second ticket is the Grand Sanpo Premium Pass. This also has a specific time for the Warehouse and allows entrance to all four outdoor areas. The Premium part allows entrance to specific buildings inside of the areas, including Mei &amp; Satsuki's Home, the Earth Antique Store, Okino's Residence, the Witch's Home, and Howl's Moving Castle. Without a premium pass, you cannot enter these buildings. This ticket is 7300&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a third ticket which only includes access to Mononoke Village, The Valley of Witches, and all buildings in the Valley of Witches. Because these two areas are recent additions to the Ghibli Park, they created a new ticket just for people who had visited in the first year. This ticket is 3300&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;, and I think it will only be available temporarily for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final type of ticket is the last-minute Sanpo Pass. This ticket can only be purchased 7 days before your arrival, and it only includes the 4 outdoor areas of the park. There's no access to buildings, and no access to the Ghibli Warehouse. Also, you only have 3 hours to use your tickets to enter the areas. This ticket is only 1500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I purchased the 3500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; Grand Sanpo Pass for November 1st, the 2-year anniversary of the park's opening. The Premium Pass sold out too quickly for me to buy, but there seemed like a lot to do already. There were so many places to go and see. I wanted this trip to be more of a dry run rather than an exhaustive one. My warehouse entry time was Noon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open and Opening&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Ghibli Park's website clearly stating that there is absolutely no parking, there was plenty of parking. I think they state this based on a technicality that Ghibli Park itself has no dedicated parking, but the Expo Park has plenty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ghibli Park is the main draw (and often only draw) for the Expo Park, Ghibli Park still treats itself part of the area, rather than the whole thing. As such, the park is almost completely open. I arrived at around 8:30am, well before the 10am opening time. I was planning on sitting in my car, and going through photos. But, so many people were walking in after they parked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike a typical theme park or museum, there is no gate, and no perimeter closing the park off to people who didn't have tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5795_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bell tower elevator was completely open. Just hop in, and go down to the park area without showing a ticket or anything. I kept looking around for where I needed to scan my ticket or what I needed to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the specific areas of Ghibli Park are ticketed, but the entire park itself is completely open. You don't need a ticket to walk around the park! Plus, there are a lot of things you can do and see without even having a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opening around 9am was the observation point. I walked up to the top, and it gave a full view of the Valley of Witches, the newest and largest addition to the park. Again, no ticket required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5806_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one was yet around, but some of the buildings were being prepared for today's crowds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the observation point, I walked down through the other path which led to the Mononoke Village. I got yelled at for entering the area even though it was all open. So, I walked around the park for a while and got a good idea of the overall layout. I came back at 10am, and gained entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="purple"&gt;Mononoke Village &lt;span class='ja'&gt;もものけの里&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mononoke Village is an open area designed to look like the Emishi village at the beginning of the film. There is a path that cuts through rice fields, with the village's lookout tower, destroyed when the demon Nago attacks the village. Not far away is Nago itself covered and infested with the demon worms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5855_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5826_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5858_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearby is also Okkoto on the brink of being infested and corrupted. Children can climb through him, and slide down his back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the gift-shop, the main building in the Mononoke Village is an old-style hall with a grass roof. The roof has about 3 inches of dirt, wet to the touch, for the grass to grow from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5867_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is an outer fence surrounding the perimeter of the hall. If the fence had grass covering, too, the hall would look like it blended into the scenery, completely camouflaged from anyone moving by, possibly explaining with the Emishi were so unknown and mythical in the film. Inside, you could spend 1200&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; to cook your own Goheimochi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Mononoke area was big, but there wasn't a whole lot to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gift Shops and Button Badges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every area within Ghibli Park has its own gift shop with general and exclusive merchandise. The Mononoke Village had an Ashitaka hat, like the one in the film, some plushies, and some pins and buttons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every area has a button badge that matches the art from the website. The buttons are only 300&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;, so it's not too expensive to hunt down the full set by doing to each area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spoilers&lt;/i&gt;, but I was able to collect them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6294_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collecting each of the buttons was a lot like a stamp rally. It was fun hunting them down, although the process certainly prays of my sense of consumerism. Many of the gift shops have lines, so while you wait to buy the buttons, you're also tempted to buy other stuff too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the exclusive merchandise, throughout all of Ghibli Park, I ended up buying things from 7 different gift shops. My main gets are pictured above: the buttons and the Ghibli Park Guide Book. I bought a bunch of other things as Christmas Presents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Even though there are photo icons or badges of the premium areas on the website, there are no button badges for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cat Castle Playground &lt;span class='ja'&gt;猫の城遊具&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just outside of the Mononoke Village is a non-ticket area called the Cat Castle Playground. It has a separate entrance fee but it's free on weekdays. I just walked around and took some photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5891_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5923_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were small easter-eggs throughout the rooms and areas in the playground. Almost all of the references were things related to what cats would like. It was fine, but the playground was really not designed for me. Elementary school kids were the prime demographic, but I think even the older 5th and 6th graders would probably get bored pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Walking to Dondoko Forest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having only spent about 40 minutes in Mononoke Village and the Cat Castle Playground, I still had more than an hour before my Warehouse entry time. I went to the furthest area away, Dondoko Forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5947_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a shortcut to the Forest by cutting through another forest. By walking through the gate and greeting the stone statue, you can take the steep, casual, or middle course going up the hill, and back down the other side. Alternatively, you could also take the cat bus from the station in front of Mononoke Village to the other side of the park. I didn't realize this at the time, but I'm more of a walker, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="olive"&gt;Dondoko Forest &lt;span class='ja'&gt;どんどこ森&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dondoko Forest is one of the more barebones areas in the park. Once you enter through the gate, you have the option of walking or taking the tram to the top of the hill. I walked. But, I also got a little lost in the forest. Signage is not so great. At the top, you're greeted by a Totoro statue, and the gift shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5930_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Totoro statue acts like a shrine to commemorate your ascent of the hill. The gift shop sells netsuke, amulets, and charms similar to items you'd find at a shrine with various Ghibli characters. This is where I bought the area's button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading down the hill are the wooden gates welcoming you to the Dondoko Forest. This leads to the exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5940_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the foot of the hill near the exit is the oldest building of Ghibli Park. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Satsuki and Mei's Home &lt;span class='ja'&gt;サツキとメイの家&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the park's opening, the Satsuki and Mei home will built in 2005, and it's been available to visit on its own since then. I had visited the house in 2019 with my sister and niece. Now, it's part of the premium pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_5847_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Satsuki Mei home is a replica house like the character's new country home in Totoro. There's the bath, well, attic, and atrium where their father wrote his book next to piles and piles of other books. Everything is created with specific attention to detail to recreate the scenes exactly as they appeared in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was pretty crowded when we visited in 2019, but now, being part of the premium pass and how exclusive those tickets are, I'm sure it's much more relaxed and open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="orange"&gt;Ghibli Warehouse &lt;span class='ja'&gt;ジブリの大倉庫&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having finished the Dondoko area, I walked back to the center of the park and waited in line for the Warehouse. My entry time was Noon, and the time was 11:30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241114_ghibli_warehouse/IMG_5952_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ghibli Warehouse is one of the key areas of the park. It's like an expanded version of the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/ghibli-museum" title="http://theschlock.com/ghibli-museum"&gt;Ghibli Museum&lt;/a&gt; near Tokyo. You get a ticket to watch an exclusive Ghibli Film. There are areas showcasing the creativity and history of Ghibli. And, much like the rest of the park, tons of areas that replicate scenes and characters from Ghibli Film's library of works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is so much here. I'm going to make a separate post about it. You can look at the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/ghibli-warehouse" title="http://theschlock.com/ghibli-warehouse"&gt;photos&lt;/a&gt; now, though, if you'd like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I stayed in the warehouse for over 2 hours. 20 minutes of that was waiting in line at the gift shop. I got my button, plus other gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="magenta"&gt;Valley of Witches &lt;span class='ja'&gt;魔女の谷&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It began raining, but, next, it was finally time to visit the other key area of the park, the Valley of Witches. This area focuses on the works of Ghibli Film that specifically deal with magic, namely Kiki's Delivery Service, Earwig and the Witch, and Howl's Moving Castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6191_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connected to the entrance, is The Flying Oven, a full service restaurant with many dishes and treats, like the ones you've seen in Ghibli Film. Maybe an oversight on my part, but I did not eat anything in the park, at all. I had a pizza in my car from visiting Costco the day before, so I already had more food than I needed. I'll do more of a food journey on my next trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road leading into the main area slowly reveals more and more buildings of the town. The first building is The Witch's Home, from Earwig and the Witch. This is the home where Bella Yaga and Mandarake live, and bring Earwig after they adopt her. This home is part of the premium pass, so I could not enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The road continues passed a fountain and some more buildings. There's a building with a confusing layout that is inspired by a boy who dreams of flying, like the puzzles in Laputa or Kiki. I didn't really notice any strong references. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next to this building is the valley's Clock Tower. The Clock Tower sits at the edge of ruins from a possibly city, leading to Howl's Moving Castle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6219_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6204_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6233_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howl's Moving Castle was magnificent. While it's not one of my favorites, it's still a film that I treasure and have fond memories of watching it with friends and family across different eras of my life. Seeing this one-to-one scale recreation of the mythical building was inspiring. Visiting the inside would probably bring up even more feelings. But, premium only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Howl's Moving Castle is the crown jewel of the park looking from the Outside, the Okino Residence is the other treasure, but more from the inside. Also, premium only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6238_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Okino Residence is Kiki's childhood home. This is where she lived before leaving on her journey and training to become a witch in the city of Koriko. Looking at photos online, there are beautiful rooms, like her mother's potion laboratory, the witch's shop, kitchen, and bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back into the main town is the Guuchoki Bakery where Kiki lived with the Osono family. Connected to the bakery, is the Hatter's Hat Shop (from Howl), which sells hats and candy, the Witch's Bookshelf on the second floor, with various books about magic, and Sophie's workshop also on the second floor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearby is a Hot Dog stand selling hot dogs with buns that look like cat's paws. They also sell beer, apparently. (Man, I need to back). On the way out of the Valley Witches is the main gift store, Thirteen Witches. This is where I bought the button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="light_blue"&gt;Hill of Youth &lt;span class='ja'&gt;青春の丘&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final area that I had yet to visit was the Hill of Youth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6253_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two buildings here. The main one is the antique shop from Whisper of the Heart. The ground floor is filled with antiques, and the second floor is filled with mechanical clocks and materials for creating violins. The inside of the building is premium only, and the gift shop is inside, too. In order to get my final button, I had to ask one of attendants and she escorted me inside to the store to quickly buy it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other building of the Hill of Youth is the Cat Office from The Cat Returns, the spin-off film to Whisper of the Heart. It's a small "cat-sized" building you can only view by peering through the windows. Inside, the Baron meets with Muta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6255_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241115_ghibli_park/IMG_6270_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a premium pass, this area is pretty empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ghibli Park&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Ghibli Park is pretty incredible. With all the terrible shit in the world, it's amazing that there's a place you can visit that brings you back to those pure feelings of creativity and wonder that Ghibli Films so often inspire. I suppose this is how people felt when visiting Disney Land, 30 or 40 years ago, before it went bad. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Premium Tickets are pretty expensive, exclusive, and also gate some of the best parts of the park, the other passes aren't all that expensive and relatively easy to buy. In fact, the outdoor-only pass at only 1500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; available 7 days before arrival is an excellent last minute purchase for your trip to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, after writing up this post and looking at the things I missed (like the food and beer), I may just buy one of those 1500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt; passes and go back there over winter vacation on a day with really good weather. It's a really easy day trip for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would definitely recommend a visit, and I would also recommend this over the Ghibli Museum in Tokyo. There is way more to do in Ghibli Park and tickets are easier to get.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/ghibli-park</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/ghibli-park</link><category>Anime</category><category>Media</category><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Nintendo Museum</title><description>&lt;p&gt;A couple months ago, Nintendo announced the opening of a museum in Kyoto that showcased their rich history since their opening in the late 1800s. But, in Nintendo fashion, they didn't want to just make a boring museum. The museum has three main areas: a showcase of Nintendo history, an interactive play area with unique games, and a cafe and workshop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729.jpg" &gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5729_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nintendo Museum has been open for a month now. Tickets are given by lottery, so you sign up for 3 available times and if you're selected, you can buy tickets. One of my choices was for Halloween, and I was selected. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since before its opening on October 1st, they had a press day and allowed several content creators to run amok in the place. The entire museum has been cataloged with tons of photos and videos online. Watching all that stuff can prepare you for the museum. But, in my case, it put my expectations too high on what I wanted.  Overall, &lt;b&gt;the museum was just okay.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is some advice for the museum, if you plan on visiting. Note: The museum hours are 10am to 5pm, and my entry time was 1pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pointers for the Store&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to the store immediately when you arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those controller cushions only have a limited amount available each day. I saw people walking around having bought some, but I don't know if they had been there all day and got them at 11am or Noon or something. I don't know if you have to say some password to someone to get one. I entered the store around 2pm maybe, and I circled around quite a bit and saw nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controller cushions aren't as big as they look. The Wii one is the longest at maybe 3 feet. I was interested in the Super Famicom controller, but it was probably 2 feet wide. Pretty small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controller cushions are also limited to one per person among all four types. Additionally, the tiny plastic controller replicas are also limited one per person. They had some of those left when I arrived, so I decided to get one and roll the dice. (I got a VB controller lol)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bunch of other stuff was sold out in the store. Apparently, all those tiny controller keychains sold out around 3pm. They also didn't have any of the high end Hanafuda cards. They were missing some other stuff too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stuff is expensive, too. Shirts are 5500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. They did have some Ultra Hands, but there were 7500&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Very few single items were under 2000&lt;span class='ja'&gt;円&lt;/span&gt;. Also, unlike the Nintendo Store, you couldn't get points with your Nintendo Account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I bought a lanyard for my Nintendo card, the cheap hanafuda set, and one controller keychain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5785_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5789_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pointers for Hanafuda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign up for Hanafuda immediately when you arrive. Sign-ups are right next to the store by the entrance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can only sign up for the workshop and hanafuda sessions within 2-3 hours of your entry time. So, if you decide later that you might want to do it, all the times available to you will be sold out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was still able to do the Hanafuda painting session, but I couldn't do the learning/play session. It's fine, though. Like many of the amusement games, it looked like it was best played with 2 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The painting and making hanafuda cards was pretty fun. I have some pointers on how I could probably make mine look better for next time, but I will refrain from mentioning them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Other Pointers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would say those are the two biggest things to pay attention to. The museum and amusement areas won't take you too long to go through, and they'll always be available for you. If you buy stuff first, it's not too difficult to lug around bags of stuff either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a smaller point: outside of the museum, there is nothing else around at all. This land must've been super cheap or the only thing available in the area because it's next to a Mazda dealership, a supermarket, and a bookstore. There's also a bicycle shop, and a couple other empty plots of land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, if you're driving, there is scattered parking around the area. But driving in Kyoto is fucking terrible. Roads are narrower than most cities and there are too many cars. You could probably park at the Tsutaya? I think that's all paid parking, so why not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Museum&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arrived at the museum 2 hours early. Went to a Book Off down the road. Then walked around for a while. I eventually just sat in front of the museum with an hour left to kill. They let me in 15 minutes early. After going through the entrance, security screens, and baggage check, I was in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5726_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really knowing what to do first, I followed the signs and went to the 2nd floor museum. No photos allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd floor showcased Nintendo prominent 40-year video game history with huge displays of each console generation and boxes from each of the 3 major regions of release: Japan, America, and Europe. They also had a sales ratio breakdown of each region, too. Nintendo 64 and Gamecube were huge in America making over half the overall total sales. The Nintendo DS had Japan take over half the total sales, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was neat, but...  It didn't really impress me or move me. So many people around me were going, "Oh wow, do you remember this?" "Oh man, this is so cool." But me... I guess I already had these waves of Nintendo nostalgia wash over me thanks to the Analogue Pocket and Mister FPGA consoles, and the Super Nintendo Mini. Also, I already saw a bunch of these games at Book Off a few hours ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not really nostalgia when this stuff is so ever present in my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prototypes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This most interesting thing in the museum was off in the far corner. Behind a glass walled room were some haphazard displays of console prototypes. They had the original prototypes of Wii-motes, the gamecube, gameboy, Nintendo DS, Wii balance board, the Switch. This was actual lesser know or seen history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind them was a Donkey Kong arcade game, a few other arcade games, and shelves and shelves of other hardware or sales merchandise sitting in boxes. This led into an area that was roped off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they go through this initial batch of ticket holders, maybe they'll collect all this stuff into an actual exhibition room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interactive Arcade&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All areas of the Nintendo Museum were open, so you can go downstairs whenever you wanted, play some games, and then return upstairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Nintendo Museum ticket doubles as a play pass for all the games on the 1st floor. To play a game, you tap your pass and register to play the game. You have 10 coins total (cannot be refilled). Each game took certain amounts of coins. It is not possible to play everything, but you can still play a lot. The games go by pretty quickly, and Several games require two players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giant Controllers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5739_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I immediately noticed that Dr Mario was available on the giant Famicom controller, so that's where my first coins went. &lt;b&gt;Pointers?&lt;/b&gt; These controllers are actually giant. I have a pretty big arm span, but it was not possible to play with just one person. Also, it required two accounts to register, so you couldn't sign up yourself. I had one of the staff members help me out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They only give you 5 minutes, and they start you at level 1. Me and the dude made it to level 2, but it went by so fast. Oh well, it was fun. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It used 2 coins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;ul class="museum-list"&gt;&lt;li class="museum-header"&gt;Use Date : 2024-October-31 (Thu)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_08.svg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13:12 (Asia/Tokyo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Controller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item column"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Family Computer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item column"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;Dr. Mario&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level Reached&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Score&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;1,000 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item photos"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download1.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download2.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download3.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Zapper &amp; Super Scoper SP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walked around and looked at other games. Nothing was super amazing. The Zapper game was the biggest and high production valued game there. It took 4 coins, the most of any game available. Expensive... but shit, was I really not going to play it? I'm not going to save these coins for anything else. I got in line and it didn't take too long for my turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5761_stitch_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zapper game is a 12-player shooting gallery game where everyone chooses to use either a Zapper or a Super Scope. There are 3 rounds with various Mario enemy characters appearing, and you shoot down as many as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pointers?&lt;/b&gt; One key thing about learning how to play this is being able to watch the groups in front of you play their games. Everyone's score is tallied and there's an overall Gold, Silver, and Bronze winner of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it was my group's turn, I immediately noticed that you could shoot anywhere on the screen. You are not limited to the area in front of you. You could shoot way down to the other side of the screen if you wanted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing this, as the enemies appeared, I shoot down everything that appeared in front of the people beside me first before turning my attention to stuff in front of me. I was in booth #5, so I could clear out lots of enemies from booths #1-#4 and still have stuff left going from #5 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Blue turtles give you +3 points each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I got first place with 215 points. :) I did not see what the second place score was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;ul class="museum-list"&gt;&lt;li class="museum-header"&gt;Use Date : 2024-October-31 (Thu)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_06.svg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13:32 (Asia/Tokyo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zapper &amp; Score SP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Controller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;Zapper&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 1 Score&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;106 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 2 Score&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;59 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage 3 Score&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;50 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall Score&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;215 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item column"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trophies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/0_1.webp"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ultra Hand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, I did the Ultra Hand game. It was only 1 coin. You use an Ultra Hand to grab poke balls moving along a suspended conveyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5774.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5774.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5774_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5774_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5774_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pointers?&lt;/b&gt; The Ultra Hand feels kinda flimsy, but you need to strong-arm it a bit to get it working right. You close the arms together, like gardening sheers, to close the gripping hands on the end. Then you open the hand to bring it back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hands will close and always stay closed. You need to clamp down hard (very hard) on the string so it doesn't move, which will pull open the hands on the end. You may feel like you're clamping down on the string hard enough, but it easily slips through the plastic. You need to crush down on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the staff member explained that to me completely, I was totally ready. The game was competitive in a group of 4 people. Once again, I got first in my group. Although, the lady next to me was a pretty close second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;ul class="museum-list"&gt;&lt;li class="museum-header"&gt;Use Date : 2024-October-31 (Thu)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_02.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_02.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_02.svg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13:44 (Asia/Tokyo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra Hand SP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fireworks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;8 launchs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item column"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/ultra-hand-fireworks.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/ultra-hand-fireworks.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/ultra-hand-fireworks.webp"/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item photos"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download4.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download4.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download4.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download4.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download4.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download5.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download5.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download5.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download5.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download5.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download6.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download6.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download6.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download6.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download6.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ultra Machine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next I played the Ultra Machine. It's an indoor batting game. It fires ping pong balls, and you swat them with a whiffle bat. You can hit various things in the makeshift room, and it'll make breaking sounds or do something, like fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was terrible at this. Maybe I should've played on my knees. I missed nearly every ball, and the ones I hit went straight up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was 2 coins. I should've played the Giant Nintendo 64.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;ul class="museum-list"&gt;&lt;li class="museum-header"&gt;Use Date : 2024-October-31 (Thu)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_03.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_03.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_03.svg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13:49 (Asia/Tokyo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultra Machine SP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Number of Swings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item photos"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download7.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download7.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download7.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download7.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download7.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download8.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download8.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download8.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download8.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download8.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download9.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/download9.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download9.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download9.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/download9.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Classic Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 1 coin, you could play a classic game for 5 minutes.

Why would I spend my precious single remaining coin on something I'll just play at home later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5775.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5775.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5775_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5775_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_5775_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh wait, what's this? In the back, and completely open were stations with an NES challenge. Play NES versions of Donkey Kong, Pinball, Mario Bros, Balloon Fight, and Super Mario Bros, each for 1 minute and rack up as many points as possible. I used my remaining coin on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I completely biffed on Donkey Kong, but my scores were pretty good on the other games. After each game, they give you a 5-star ranking. I ended with a 4-star total ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;ul class="museum-list"&gt;&lt;li class="museum-header"&gt;Use Date : 2024-October-31 (Thu)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_01.svg" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_01.svg" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/icon_museum_01.svg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;13:59 (Asia/Tokyo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo Classic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item column"&gt;&lt;p class="title"&gt;NES Challenge 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item data"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="content"&gt;★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item game"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAEE.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAEE.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAEE.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1,400 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item game"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAHJE.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAHJE.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAHJE.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;8,160 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item game"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAWE.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAWE.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAWE.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;6,470 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item game"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAARE.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAARE.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAARE.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;14,750 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="item game"&gt;&lt;div class="img"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAAE.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAAE.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/CLV-P-NAAAE.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;26,150 pts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;★★★★★&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hatena Burger and Hanafuda&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After using all my coins, I went to the store and then reserved a time for hanafuda. With 40 minutes before hanafuda, I bought a burger at the cafe. All ordering is done on the phone. Scan the QR code, complete your order online, pay at the counter, and wait for the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's the menu:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bp5MSMud9DbecM46m-iZUHi74fS9qtrF/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bp5MSMud9DbecM46m-iZUHi74fS9qtrF/view?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/hatena-burger-menu.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/hatena-burger-menu.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/nintendo-museum/hatena-burger-menu.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ordered a Wasabi burger, without any customization. The burger was small, but it was really good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After, I went upstairs to make some hanafuda cards. I think my overall crafting skills failed me. The light colors were too light, so I used more paint and it went everywhere. The dark colors were too dark, so those parts are completely blacked out. Glueing the paper on the back was pretty messy, and took quite a while. I was getting close to the one hour limit of the craft room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_1715.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_1715.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_1715_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_1715_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241101_nintendo/IMG_1715_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do I really care if they look professional though? Nah... Although, maybe I should've just torpedoed my project at the first sign of trouble to make something more unique. Eh, it's fine. I learned how traditional hanafuda cards were made, and learned a little bit more about what hanafuda is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Expectations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I spent about 3 1/2 hours at the Nintendo Museum, which felt like stretching the most out of my time there. I left there somewhat disappointed in the experience. That's it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, writing about it is a bit cathartic. I actually did kinda do a lot there after all. How long do you usually stay at museums? 3 1/2 hours is pretty decent after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, I think they'll add more to the museum. More games downstairs perhaps? A new exhibit upstairs to fill that empty back space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More businesses might move to the area too, filling up those vacant nearby lots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd like to go back in a year or two with some friends. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/nintendo-museum</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/nintendo-museum</link><category>Games</category><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Digital Retro Game Library</title><description>&lt;p&gt;My retro gaming hardware collection has grown recently. The Analogue Pocket introduced me into a gaming platform possible of playing decades of games across dozens of consoles, handhelds, and arcade boards. Recently, I got a Mister which expanded this reach even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I made a &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-curated-games"&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; that catalogued all of the notable games I had on my Analogue Pocket. And now I've revamped that curated list into an overall Digital Retro Game Library. This lists all the notable games I have available on both the Pocket and the Mister. More platforms may be added in the future, like PS2 and Gamecube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/apps/pocket" title="http://theschlock.com/apps/pocket"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Digital Retro Game Library&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/apps/pocket" title="http://theschlock.com/apps/pocket"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/241030_gamelibrary/IMG_5723_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playlists&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, these games were being collected to build Genre lists of games using the now-canceled Playlist feature for the Analogue Pocket. The idea was that I could scroll through a Genre of games and choose one to play without having to pay attention to the hardware platform it was designed for. I was collecting all this information using &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-utils" title="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-utils"&gt;Pocket Utils&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of Java programs that I wrote to manage games and stuff on my Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later, after the Playlist feature was buried and gone, I decided to put all of this information into a webpage so I could at least see everything visually. This was the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-curated-games" title="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket-curated-games"&gt;Pocket Curated Games&lt;/a&gt; page, the first iteration of this project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later again and recently, I got a Mister. The Mister is the premiere FPGA gaming platform, and the Analogue Pocket is a handheld FPGA device. FPGA cores are written for specific hardware, so there are advantages to both platforms, although the Mister can generally handle more complicated systems and it's open source. Because of this, people have built several features and accessories on top of the platform. One thing implemented a couple years ago was Shortcuts. Rather than turning on a core and choosing a game, you could choose a game directly from the main menu. This is exactly like how I wanted Playlists to work on the Analogue Pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, by updating the programs in Pocket Utils to look for Mister games, I could add all that information in the database. And writing a new program, I could automatically make shortcuts to all the games I have managed in my database, essentially creating all the Playlists I wanted from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pocket Curated Page being revamped into the Digital Retro Game Library now shows all those games, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Launching Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's another really nice feature available on the Mister called TapTo. TapTo is a service that runs in the background on Mister and accepts game executing commands. The main idea for this feature was to bring back physicality to the Mister, which is a sole digital platform. Using a physical NFC reader you can "tap" a physical NFC card (or anything with an NFC signal) and it will automatically launch the game associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not interested in having a huge collection of cards for individual games. But, I was very interested in TapTo's feature of launching RANDOM games. By sorting all of my shortcuts to games in Genre folders, I could launch a random Shooter or random Fighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, the TapTo service was upgraded to accept network requests. Any device connected to the same Wifi network could send a command to TapTo and it'll execute it. They launched a phone app that took advantage of this, but the request service is wide open. Anything can send commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, combining yet another project with this, I added functionality in my chat bot, &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/schlock-bot" title="http://theschlock.com/schlock-bot"&gt;Schlock Bot&lt;/a&gt;, to accept requests to launch random games from my Genres. With Pocket Utils updated to manage my Mister games, Schlock Bot can read this information too, and launch individual games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;!game Shooter&lt;br/&gt;!game Panzer Dragoon (Saturn)&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These commands can be typed in my Discord and read by Schlock Bot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Going Further&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One annoying thing about typing in games to launch in Discord is that you have to type them correctly. Dr. Mario has a period in it, so if you type Dr Mario, it won't find the game. Also, I have a Gameboy Color version of Dr. Mario, too, so which one do you want? You need to be annoyingly specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, using the Digital Game Library, you can click on a game, it'll write that execution command in Discord, Schlock Bot will read the command (if it's running), and then launch the game on Mister (if that's running too).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the Digital Retro Game Library not only shows all my available games, but it's also a method of selecting games to play on the Mister.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of moving parts in between clicking a game and it launching on the Mister. It would be a lot better if the webpage sent the request to Schlock Bot directly. But, this janky thing works for the time being. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Future Additions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting back to the Library, prior to getting a Mister, I set up a Playstation 2 with a game server to play all of those classic games. I made an &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/playstation-2-game-inventory" title="http://theschlock.com/playstation-2-game-inventory"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; page that shows all of those games, but I'm thinking about adding them in this library, too. Also, I may mod a gamecube in the future to play a library of those games. I will want to have a library of those games listed somewhere, so adding them here or on the PS2 inventory page makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to more games, I was thinking of putting download links to my save files for each game, too. I'm already doing this on the PS2 Game Inventory page with memory cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We'll see. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/digital-retro-game-library</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/digital-retro-game-library</link><category>Games</category><category>Internet</category><category>Projects</category><category>Programming</category><category>Local</category></item><item><title>The Callisto Protocol</title><description>&lt;p&gt;You are a space trucker on your last mission before retirement. You're carrying some medical supplies from the prison on Callisto to Europa, both moons of Jupiter. But, shit goes wrong when terrorists responsible for a biological attack on Europa board your ship, attack you, and ultimately send your vessel back into Callisto's atmosphere, and crash on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You survive the crash, but your copilot is dead. All members of the terror group are dead, except one. As the moon's guards discover the crash and find you, both of you are taken to the prison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things get even worse when the pathogen from the biological attack spreads in the prison mutating many of the inmates into deranged violent abominations. The prison begins the fall apart allowing you to mount an escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825192638_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is how the story of Callisto Protocol begins. You are Jacob Lee, who's just a normal dude put into extreme circumstances. On the surface, it seems like a pretty standard action adventure game with an involved story and twists here and there. But, this game ends up living in the shadow of another, which dominates the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derivative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as Callisto Protocol may want to stand on its own, it's hard to talk about it without talking about &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/dead-space" title="http://theschlock.com/dead-space"&gt;Dead Space&lt;/a&gt;. Callisto Protocol comes from one of the original creators of Dead Space, and has some members of the old team, too. Callisto tries its best to emulate what made Dead Space so great, but fails on almost every front. It takes some cues from &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/the-last-of-us-part-2" title="http://theschlock.com/the-last-of-us-part-2"&gt;Last of Us&lt;/a&gt; as well, but it feels like a rip-off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enemies and Combat&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, we be fighting zombies again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Dead Space and Last of Us have zombies and while the high points of both those games go far behind their enemy designs, the enemies are still interesting. The necromorphs in Dead Space had a very dynamic design that supported the combat. The infected in Last of Us were detailed enough that you could see how the fungal infection grew and mutated their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240825203241_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, that's a zombie. In Callisto, the biophages just look like dudes with skin problems. Later, you fight some others that look like Clickers from Last of Us. And then you fight deaf zombies EXACTLY like Clickers from Last of Us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One departure from Dead Space is that Callisto isn't a shooter first, but a brawler. You bob and weave incoming attacks and counter with a melee weapon, so it makes sense the zombies are more like crazed humans. But now we're doing Arkham Batman combat, and Arkham Batman combat was not this stiff. Batman combat was designed around fighting multiple enemies at once, and you could react to them working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callisto often struggles with this. Every attack has weight to it, but that weight often pushes you into a position you don't want. Other enemies then attack or you get stuck in a corner looking the wrong direction. It hard to tell where enemies are coming from if they aren't in front of you. Jacob isn't nimble enough to run around and take out enemies, so you always have to focus on them one-at-a-time, which slows down the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And you're already moving pretty slow. In Dead Space, Isaac's slow movement made sense because you're moving around in a 200lbs suit meant for protection from environmental and occupational hazards. You're like a tank. In Callisto, you're only wearing a cloth prison jump suit. Jacob isn't some huge muscle dude, either. He looks like he could sprint down a hall way and slip past a group of people. Later, you get an EVA suit, but it looks flexible enough to move easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Environment and Immersion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key points of Dead Space was its immersive environment supported by the heavy futuristic machinery, dynamic lighting and color, and a sharp distinct and unique set of sounds that overwhelmed you. Incorporating all of the HUD and UI elements into the character and environment made you feel immersed in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last of Us had a similar approach. There were still some UI elements that assisted the player through exploration and combat, but the lack of music and use of silence matched with the vibrant lush overgrown environments which immersed me in the exploration of Seattle and listening for the subtle movements of enemies around blind corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both games felt designed around the opportunity to give creative people a chance to make the most of their opportunities, and create dynamic and memorable experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212920_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Callisto has some unique areas, but the first half of the game is moving through drab metal hallways and then the prison's sewer system. Lots of pipes and moving through vents. The arboretum is a nice area, but it's dark and muddy. Later, you visit an old mining area. The density of buildings and their layout is interesting, but the buildings themselves aren't very interesting. The environments are definitely detailed, but they don't really inspire creativity in me. It feels too restrictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest flop of Callisto is its lack of dynamic sound. There's no unique sound of heavy machinery working. There's no sharp crack of gun fire or welding tools. There's no use of silence to accent the enemies movements. And overall, the music is pretty generic and used too frequently. There are no surprises or memorable experiences through sound, which dampens the overall experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, the monotony is broken up by breaking out onto the surface of Callisto. You put on an EVA and are shot out into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836.webp"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240827212836_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The snow is pushed around by your foot steps and moving gates. While trying to find your way to the space depot, the blizzard often overwhelms your vision. At least now, Jacob's slow lumbering movements make sense. If Jacob could move faster or more dynamically, I would've loved to stay outside longer, but everything just seems to weigh down the experience that I want to move on to the next section as quick as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, we get another unique area, the clean living area of the administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901192951_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game could've used more unique areas like this. But, we're in a prison and we're climbing through sewers and mines. There aren't many opportunities to have fantastical elements while making the setting down-to-earth. Perhaps Callisto Protocol tries to bring too much reality to its setting. As a result, all of the edges feel sanded off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;What a Twist!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through attempting to escape, you journey into the depths of Callisto to an abandoned mining colony from 75 years ago, and discover the truth of the biophage outbreak. Can you guess?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, it turns out the government was behind the biophage attack on Europa, not the terrorists. And the terrorists were people caught up in the attack who blamed the government. The reason you were caught up in everything, too, was because the medical supplies you transported to Europa were hiding the viral agent that started the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;75 years ago, the first outbreak occurred in this mining colony as the scientists responsible for the biophage tested their progress. Once the outbreak was concealed, the prison was built on top of it to continue testing the biophage virus on inmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901142817_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was aliens all along. The miners had discovered the corpse of a massive alien and studied its secrets. The government agency funding this science believed the larvae of the alien could help human ascend to the next level of evolution allowing them to expand within the universe further. The biophage virus was the result of their research, and injecting humans was meant to make them impervious to the harsh environment of space. But, whatdya know, it just turned them into monsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Callisto Protocol is the development of this biophage to push humanity to the next level of evolution, and its eventually release and conversion of all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240901194403_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They got pretty close making an evolved human with this guy. But eventually he also turns into a mindless monster and you gotta shoot him in the face anyway. With their prime experiment defeated, the government (actually a crazed religious group) sets the prison to self-destruct. With only one escape pod available, you shove your friend into it and she escapes along with records of the event and a sample of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are still stuck on the planet and the game ends as the monster jumps at you. No real ending, just a few words and cut to black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continued in DLC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the $15 DLC, the story continues. You wake up with the doctor speaking to your through an earpiece. Get up! There are more secrets to be had! You travel to her lab and her hologram explains about the further experiments and atrocities. There was a competing experiment being held to push humans to the next stage of evolution. And you find out that the doctor led the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You stumble further down into her lab into far more interesting, detailed, and amazing looking areas than the main game. Areas use a lot of orange light to break away from the boring metal blue walls and floors. Bio-matter spreads and grows from the walls transforming it into an alien or infested looking environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906214812_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is often difficult to tell whether something is going to come out of the wall to get you, or whether danger is just around the corner. The terrible "mood" music and jump scares are turned down and used in actual appropriate moments compared to the main game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanity effects are now used, too, as it feels like Jacob is slowing falling apart mentally. You open up a treasure chest to receive nothing, and turn around to find the chest in front of you again, but unopened. You move down a hallway as enemies continuously attack you, not realizing the path forward is to turn around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;A New Enemy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something new appears in the depths of the labs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907143246_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prison bots from before have been infected and fused with bio-matter making them stronger and more aggressive than before. It's still not too difficult to dodge out of the way and slam them with your electrified police baton, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as you enter the laboratory in the police bot factory, your baton is destroyed after beating a bot over and over again to its death. Your main weapon used throughout the entire game and a fundamental staple of how the game play works is removed from your arsenal. You can no longer easily dodge and counter enemies. The brawler has turned into a clumsy shooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not long before you are chased into a test room with bots closing in on all of your sides when you obtain the best funnest weapon in the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240906233036_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hammer replaces your police baton and smashes through bots after a few hits. Zombies from before are cut through like butter. Up until this point, the whole game felt like you're fighting against the gameplay. Eventually you find a rhythm that works, but it ends up becoming a single use solution to every encounter. Now you feel incredible and powerful by slicing and smashing through everything that sucked about the game before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Reason&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the Callisto Protocol is the development of the biophage to push humanity into the next stage of evolution. Their main plan ended up turning people into zombie monsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor had a different idea and tried to compete with them. The doctor created these bio-bots as her solution to humanity's evolution. The bots were fused with human skin, muscles, and brain using the alien biophage material. Human consciousness was then uploaded into the bots for humanity to live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It didn't work. Just like the zombies, the bots became mindless machines of destruction and ripped apart anything that was human, relying too much on the prison's programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Ending&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor had been luring you further into the depths of the lab to reach an escape pod she had prepared for herself. As you arrive near the hatch, the doctor is grabbed by a robot. The bot infects and mutates the doctor into an abomination that you juke, jive, and smash until it's dead. With the doctor's voice still in your ear, you proceed to the escape pod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The escape pod is your ship, though. It's your destroyed ship that crashed into Callisto in the beginning. The doctor directs you to hop on the controls and get out of there. You escape the prison, escape the moon. You continue to fly as far away as fast as you can. And space begins to light up. The light gets brighter and brighter to point where you can't see anything but white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/callisto_protocol/The_Callisto_Protocol_20240907145107_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's done. You're done. You're dead. You've been dead this whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As your friend had escaped earlier with all the lab's data, you were killed as the enemies closed in. The doctor found your body, and ignited the few remaining sparks in your brain. The doctor used the implant in your head linked to your friend in order to send the remaining data she had exposing the government's horrific projects on Callisto, and her involvement in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It felt like the DLC was going to give some full closure to the ending. And I suppose it did. Callisto Protocol no longer ends on a cliffhanger. But, it's not a happy ending and it completely closes the book on Jacob's story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Real Life Ending&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people feel cheated by the ending, and further cheated by paying $15 to get an ending that punches them in the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The publisher ultimately is to blame for the abrupt ending and pay-per-view ending. Krafton cut the development time towards the end of the project and forced the release date ahead of schedule. New enemy types were scrapped from the game, and the ending had to be reworked into what we got. It's pretty obvious that some of those scrapped ideas were remolded into the DLC ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's poetic and perhaps intentional that the final scene is of Jacob's horrific torn-apart corpse, a signal from the developer that there is no future for this game, and a metaphor of what the developers perhaps consider the result of their ideas and hard work after the publisher forced their hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sucks even more that after the release of the DLC, the developer laid off employees as the publisher realigned the focus of the studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it's easy to say Callisto Protocol is kinda lame and not all that great, but I think the DLC shows that this game and its developer had the potential to make something better and more compelling than what we got. Not everyone gets a blank check, though. And very few publishers want to take a risk. Everything has to be a financial hit these days. There's no longer any room for mediocrity even if it has some kernels of something good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I'm glad I played it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/the-callisto-protocol</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/the-callisto-protocol</link><category>Games</category><category>Game Specific</category></item><item><title>Dead Space</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Within the expanse of humanity's reach into space, the repair vessel, the Kellion, responds to a distress call sent by the USG Ishimura. The Ishimura is a massive mining starship in orbit above the planet Aegis VII, and the distress call was the last communication with anyone on board. Among the Kellion's sparse crew is Isaac Clarke, an engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Clarke and the Kellion crew board the derelict malfunctioning ship, they are attacked by transformed mutated members of the crew, known as Necromorphs. The Kellion is destroyed, and Clarke and a few other members of the Kellion begin to explore and repair the Ishimura in order to escape and find out what happened to the crew. Isaac dons his heavy duty repair suit with iconic welding helmet, an overall staple of the Dead Space series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817190714_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead Space is a survival horror game with heavy inspirations from Resident Evil 4 and Event Horizon. Originally released in 2008, Dead Space become one of the genres best examples of survival horror done right, but eventually the series fizzled out as it became more action oriented, which was reason enough for Electronic Arts to shut down the developer's studio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, EA Motive, the developers of this 2023 remake, insisted that this new game stick closely to its 2008 original, which I consider the best in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Immersion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead Space was unique upon release as one of its strict design ideas was using absolutely no HUD. All ammo, health, and menus are displayed within the universe of the characters, as if the character themselves are looking at and using those displays. All button prompts appear on the objects in the environment. If a menu appears, it comes from Isaac's computer Rig on his wrist, and he looks at it when you select menu items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although, the true crown of Dead Space's immersion is the Audio. The Ishimura is a very dense, heavy, mining vessel. All the different areas have their thick heavy machines, and these machines are all distinct and loud. Often when you enter a new area, you become completely overwhelmed by the sounds of the machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite areas in the original was Engineering. As you kickstarted the engines, the overall sound was so loud you couldn't hear any enemies or footsteps or menu movements. It was a constant blast of sound until you exited the room. This area still exists in the remake, but they moved it into a corridor instead of the overall room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240818204204_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaac is really just a repairman, and all of your weapons futuristic versions of welders, strippers, nail guns, and such. All of these guns have very powerful and electrical cracks and bursts that you may hear at a futuristic construction site. All these sounds feel like they split your ears as you rip apart the space zombies. With your heavy, 200lbs armored suit, you can also stomp them into the ground with a satisfying crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything in the environment and everything you do comes with a heavy mechanical organic weight to it. It's criminal if you don't play this game with headphones turned up to 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240817203233_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, one of the most impactful and immersive sequences is the first time you open a door, and all of the air and sound get blasted into space from a violent hull breach. Your suit's boots are magnetized so space walking is no problem, but the first time you get thrust into space feels like going over the top of a rollercoaster. It feels like part of your own breath was sucked into space, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Haunted House&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you continue to explore and repair the Ishimura, you move into new areas of the ship with new monsters. Often you'll reach a place of relatively quiet, only for a monster to SCREAM at you as it burst out of the ceiling or a nearby wall. This happens pretty often. As the game's sound fully immerses you in the environment, it tends to employ startling scare tactics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You get pretty powerful later on in the game, so when a standard zombie pops out of the wall, you can quick shoot it or bash it into the ground. Even when a bunch of zombies come at you at once, you can usually take them all at once with your arsenal. So, many of these sequences turn into a corner of a haunted house. Boo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the first time you fight a Brute can make you feel powerless. A brute is a gigantic zombie about the size of a car. When it comes rushing towards me and my gunfire has absolutely no effect, my next instinct is to run! But then the heavy suit makes it feel like you're trying to run in water, and its huge stomping lumbering movements are right on your heels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822085322_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some genuine fearful movements as you try to evade death, but ultimately, you can overcome these moments by trying again after you die. Later on, you learn about the best ways of killing things by fighting the zombies over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Retro&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People generally define retro games as anything made over 10 years ago. This was an easy statement to make in the PS3/360 era of gaming, as each new console had some genuine easy-to-see graphical and design improvements over the previous generation. For example, Super Mario World and Super Mario Sunshine were 11 years apart, and the difference between those games of the same series is absolutely massive. The jump from 2D to 3D was huge, but so is the idea of having to explore the world to find levels, having a more involved story with characters having motivations, and talking with characters to find more things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time difference between the original Dead Space and this remake is 15 years, and the overall game hasn't really changed at all. The graphics have been modernized, and load times reduced because of current generation hardware. A few quality of life features added for smoother gameplay. Isaac talks now and involves himself in the story, too. But it's still the exact same game that I remember from the Playstation 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are games from the PS3/360 era really retro if their game design still fits within the modern era of game design?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240822090323_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe some people consider games retro if they center on a single player experience. Most modern games today have some kind of social element, so you can share the experience with friends. Or they include some kind of open world experience, so it can feel like the game is endless and you can play for hours and hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead Space is a pretty tight 12 hour game, and adding any of those modern engagement traps would ruin the experience. But, at the same time, once you finish the game (and finish it a second time), you're pretty much done with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legacy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the original Dead Space, the studio became known as Visceral Games and made Dead Space 2 and Dead Space 3, as well as Dead Space Extraction (a light gun game), and some novels and comics. Dead Space 2 was another high for the series, but I think there was never enough lore and story to carry it to a full never-ending franchise. Dead Space 2 started the series into something more action-oriented to appeal to a general audience, and Dead Space 3 killed the franchise and the developer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creator of Dead Space had actually left Visceral before Dead Space 2, and recently he helmed the creation of a new game, &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/the-callisto-protocol" title="http://theschlock.com/the-callisto-protocol"&gt;Callisto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; released in 2022, which seems like an actual new Dead Space game in all but name. It's either ironic or malicious that EA came along with the Dead Space remake at the same time the original creator made a new one himself. However much of Visceral's former staff work at Motive and were key developers bringing this remake to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dead Space remake does an absolutely excellent job of sticking to the original but adding a few new things and changing others to make it even better. This remake doesn't really feel like a cash-grab. It feels like the people working on it genuinely cared about Dead Space and wanted to bring it back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it really sucks that the remake did not meet the sales EA was hoping for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ending&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through killing space zombies and finding some survivors, Isaac uncovers the truth of what happened on the Ishimura. Members of the crew became obsessed and possessed by the religion of Unitology, which revolves around an artifact found of Aegis VII, known as The Marker. The Marker slowly morphed the colonists of Aegis VII into the Necromorphs, which attacked and infected the crew of the Ishimura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the surface of Aegis VII is the Hive Mind, which controls all Necromorphs. In order to pacify and destroy it, Isaac brings the Marker back to the surface of Aegis VII. There are several other twists and turns along the way as Isaac is betrayed by his crew, and caught between the motives of Earth and the Church of Unitology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it turns out that his love interest that he's been chasing the whole game killed herself prior to the Kellion arriving at the Ishimura. He's essentially been chasing a ghost through manipulation of the Marker and an Ishimura survivor. With nothing left, Isaac continues to kill the Hive Mind, and escape the surface as the gravity tethers holding the Ishimura are severed, which sends the ship and its moon-sized payload into the planet, eradicating all remaining life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally Isaac gets to rest after a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240823111503_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, except the Marker left its mark on Isaac. In the final moments of the game, the phantom of his girlfriend attacks him. Dead Space 2 picks up with Isaac awakening in an asylum above Saturn's moon of Titan, the doctors having extracted the remnants of the Marker from his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Ending&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now there's a new, alternate ending. As Isaac runs through the Ishimura a second time, small Markers are scattered throughout the ship. Collecting all of these Markers and placing them on their alters in the Captain's quarters will unlock this ending. Now, after Isaac pacifying the Hive Mind and letting the megaton payload destroy the surface, he is no longer so solemn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/dead_space/Dead_Space_20240825121558_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a course set back to Earth, he mentions to the phantom of his girlfriend that he needs to build something first before they can return. Isaac has been fully corrupted and possessed by the Marker, it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motive had plans to make a Dead Space 2, but as an alternate sequel rather than a remake of the original sequel. This sequel probably could've followed this new ending, and maybe implement some of the original ideas the creators had for Dead Space 2 back in the day, rather than some mandates EA imposed on Visceral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EA seemed keen on continuing the remake series, but plans were scrapped as sales were poor. Motive is off working on other projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dead Space is dead yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hope&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm going to check out &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/the-callisto-protocol" title="http://theschlock.com/the-callisto-protocol"&gt;Callisto Protocol&lt;/a&gt; next and see if there's any life.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/dead-space</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/dead-space</link><category>Games</category><category>Game Specific</category></item><item><title>Emperor and The Imperial Palace 皇居</title><description>&lt;p&gt;After the United States dropped the atomic bombs on Japan, they surrendered to the United States. This was announced to the nation on August 15th, 1945, seventy-nine years ago. In the following days, officers of the United States military came to Japan, and oversaw the occupation which would rebuild Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these first few days, the American public wanted immediately and swift revenge for Pearl Harbor and Japan's involvement in the war. It was easy to place a target on the figurehead of Japan, Emperor Hirohito. To the typical American, the Emperor was like a king, and a king commands its armies to attack. So, surely Emperor Hirohito commanded Japan's army and navy to attack Pearl Harbor and enter the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur arrived in Japan to lead the occupation, one of his first assignments was given to General Bonner Fellers. This assignment was to determine the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the war. Did he give the command to attack? Did he give the command to invade?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the overall plot of the 2012 film, Emperor, starring Tommy Lee Jones as Douglas MacArthur and Matthew Fox as Bonner Fellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/emperor-poster-2_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;General Bonner Fellers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film focuses on Bonner Fellers. MacArthur entrusts Fellers with this mission of determining the Emperor's guilt because of Fellers close relation and expertise of Japan. After arriving in Tokyo, various members of the Japanese military are arrested, and Fellers oversees the operation understanding how these officers value sacrifice in the wake of defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrested officers are interrogated and seemingly uncooperative. Fellers understands the ambiguity of their answers, but is still frustrated with the lack of substantial proof and direct answers required for making a clear decision to MacArthur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h58m49s738_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my initial favorite things about Emperor was Feller's frustration. Fellers (and Matthew Fox's acting) clearly shows a love and respect for Japan, but he is constantly beat down, turned away, and disrespected by its people. He understands the damned future Japan would have without an Emperor, so he continues to fight for the answers despite the constant problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This feeling of frustration is the initial reason why this film stayed with me. I immediately identified with these feelings having lived here for a few years when seeing it for the first time. This feeling of working towards the same goal as others, but being pushed aside because I'm a perceived outsider, thus being perceived as an opponent or someone that wouldn't understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Honne and Tatemae &lt;span class='ja'&gt;本音と建前&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After watching the film recently with my Japanese language students, I had forgotten that it spent some time explaining Japanese culture. One of the key points of the film was a flashback between Fellers and his fictional girlfriend's uncle, General Kajima. The uncle explains &lt;b&gt;Honne&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Tatemae&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h59m19s716_t.webp"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tatemae&lt;/b&gt; is the way that things appear. The uncle explains to Fellers that when you look at Japan (in 1930s/40s), you see the most advanced and westernized country in all of Asia. &lt;b&gt;Honne&lt;/b&gt; is the way they really are. Underneath this westernized surface is the true heartbeat of Japan, which runs on the ancient warrior code of loyalty and obedience. From this explanation that Fellers learned before the war, he understands that without the Emperor as a symbol to guide the public, Japan would fall into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept of Honne and Tatemae is ever present in modern Japan. They consider and cherish group harmony over everything else. They do this because on the surface conflict will create rifts between individuals and eventually break that harmony. So, they often contribute and conform to the group to avoid social strife. This is why everyone perceives Japanese people as super nice and accommodating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say Japanese don't complain. When they do complain, they complain to their own social circles about something outside of it. It's often a way to bring people in their circle together. And if they complain more outwardly (like on Twitter), it's as an individual completely detached from their circles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe this sounds obvious and not really foreign to America, but it's something that foreign people who come to Japan often struggle with, especially when a Japanese person says one thing, but then does the opposite. The classic example is being invited to someone's home. They'll say, "You should come over to my house." They'll often do this as way to be nice and create harmony, but usually they expect you to decline, something like, "Oh, I'd love to some day." They don't want you to say, "Ok, when?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Group Harmony formed from Ancient History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't remember if the subject was Honne and Tatemae, but one of my college professors once mentioned that the culture of group harmony and being nice was born from being such a small country with limited resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has very clear natural outer borders, and plenty of mountains creating internal borders, too. Space for creating towns with agriculture was limited to few areas. Self-sustaining communities didn't have a lot of extra food, so if you stole from your neighbors or created problems, you would be banished from the town. Other towns and settlements also had limited resources, so they wouldn't just accept an outsider. And even if you proved your worth, they would still be wary of accepting you completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, this created the culture of group harmony above self interests. And, this is perhaps how the idea of Honne and Tatemae was formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare this to Western Europe and modern-day Americans. Our civilizations have always been formed from expanding our borders into uncharted areas. Greeks and Romans established their cities and expanded to conquer new ones. Americans broke away from Europe and expanded and "conquered" North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In America in the Wild West, if we stole from our neighbor and pissed off people, it wouldn't matter if we were banished. We could easily pick a direction and find new fertile land to start a new farm. People were constantly traveling to new places, so there was always new work available, and people dealt with problems head on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Direct and Indirect Language&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could also say that the insular culture of Japan and expansive culture of America and Europe influenced both Japanese and English languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, English is a very direct language compared to Japanese, which is built into our grammar. Our sentences always begin with the subject followed by the verb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;I walk to school everyday.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We always want to know &lt;code&gt;who&lt;/code&gt; is doing &lt;code&gt;what&lt;/code&gt; when we talk. All the other details of the sentence follow afterwards, when, why, where, how often, with whom, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japanese starts with the subject, too, although it's often not needed if the subject of conversation is clear. All the other details are expressed first before concluding the sentence with the verb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class='ja'&gt;私は&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;毎日&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;学校に&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;歩いて行きます。&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could say that a speaker wants to create a full picture of a situation first before completing and ending their thought. Comparing to English, we get the most important information said immediately, and the listener can then decide on the importance of the later details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back to the earlier example of inviting someone...  In English, if you wanted to refuse someone's invitation, it's perfectly fine to just say no. "Hey, would you like to come over this weekend?" "Sorry, I can't." You wouldn't necessarily need to provide any context. In Japanese, though, outright refusing an invitation with such a direct response could be considered rude. "&lt;span class='ja'&gt;すみません、ちょっと。。&lt;/span&gt;" "This weekend is not good for me." "I'm sorry, but I have a prior engagement." You want to make a nice soft rejection sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of culture or cognition influencing language or language influencing culture or cognition is the central focus in another one of my favorite movies: &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/arrival" title="http://theschlock.com/arrival"&gt;Arrival&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways... back to Emperor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dai-Ichi Life Building &lt;span class='ja'&gt;第一生命&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Douglas MacArthur and Bonner Fellers arrived in Tokyo, their offices were set up in the Dai-Ichi Life building, across the moat from the Imperial Palace grounds. From a story perspective, the location is perfectly fine, but the imagery and location are factual incorrect, and the location sometimes seems to move depending on what's happening in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see the Dai-Ichi Life building in the first sequence of the film as MacArthur and Fellers arrive. It's made to look more oriental and aged compared to how it actual looked. On the left is a composite image from the film, compared to the image on the right, which is apparently a photo of the building from 1945, taken from &lt;a href="https://www.oldtokyo.com/dai-ichi-seimei-sogo-building-marunouchi-c-1949/" title="https://www.oldtokyo.com/dai-ichi-seimei-sogo-building-marunouchi-c-1949/"&gt;oldtokyo.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h56m05s892_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/dai-ichi-1945_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess they didn't want the building looking modern for the film? Or, the real building looked too western or too Washington? My composite image is a little goofy, but much of the perspective of the building is off, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dai-Ichi Life building is still standing today in Tokyo in the same spot it has been since it was built in 1933. There have been some additions to the roof. Also, the original building acts as a front to a 21-story office building, which was completed in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5307_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the Dai-Ichi Building, MacArthur's office is still preserved as it was 80 years ago. It is not open to the public, but maybe someday they'll figure out a decent way to have a tour of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dai-Ichi Life Building Location&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The actual location of the Dai-Ichi Building is outside the south-eastern corner of the Imperial Palace grounds. This is at the orange circle on a nearby guide map near where the above picture was taken. The yellow circle is the location of where it appears in the film because of its near proximity to the Sei-mon gate &lt;span class='ja'&gt;正門&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5314_map.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5314_map.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5314_map_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5314_map_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5314_map_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h57m20s136.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h57m20s136.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h57m20s136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h57m20s136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-14h57m20s136_t.webp"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even the above shot from the film is doctored because the Sei-mon Gate bridge is removed and it looks like you could just walk up to Fushimi-yagura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;伏見櫓&lt;/span&gt; without crossing any bridges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reading Emperor's IMDB page, they only spent 2 days filming on location in Tokyo. All other filming was done in New Zealand. So, it makes sense that the Dai-Ichi Life building doesn't look correct, and some other things are weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, the shots filmed in Tokyo were at a single location used slightly in the background here, but substantial used in two other pivotal scenes in the film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sei-mon Gate &lt;span class='ja'&gt;正門&lt;/span&gt; / Nijubashi &lt;span class='ja'&gt;二重橋&lt;/span&gt; / Fushimi-yagura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;伏見櫓&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angered by the constant failed attempts the get answers from high ranking politicians and military commanders, Fellers gets approval from MacArthur to interview Vice Minister Sekiya. Fellers takes this written approval, and approaches the Sei-mon gate to enter the palace for his interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h02m29s594.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h02m29s594.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h02m29s594_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h02m29s594_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h02m29s594_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the film makes it look like they just went out of the Dai-Ichi Life building and approached the gate immediately. When in reality, this distance is about one kilometer. But, this is the one location where they actually filmed Emperor on site. They reused this location later towards the end of the film when Emperor Hirohito agrees to meet and talk with MacArthur out in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over summer, I met up with some friends from college, and we explored some areas in Tokyo, including the Imperial Palace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5512_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5512_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5512_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5512_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5512_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having just watched Emperor with my students, I wanted to visit the actual locations from the film to give some further context when we finish the film after summer. I should have studied these shots much closer before visiting Tokyo, but I was able to take some photos that were pretty close to the actual scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m33s053.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m33s053.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m33s053_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m33s053_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m33s053_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_2_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_2_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_2_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m22s443.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m22s443.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m22s443_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m22s443_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h03m22s443_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5489.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5489.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5489_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5489_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5489_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h01m54s258.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h01m54s258.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h01m54s258_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h01m54s258_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h01m54s258_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5320.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5320.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5320_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5320_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5320_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That final reverse shot I should've studied more, but I was able to get a photo of that tree. That same tree shows up in the same location behind Fellers (Matthew Fox), although the depth of field is pulled WAY in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In reality, I couldn't find any information that said Fellers actually entered the Palace grounds for an interview. Also, would it have been appropriate to have entered through this gate? A &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5326.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5326.jpg"&gt;nearby plaque&lt;/a&gt; states the the Sei-mon gate is only used for official diplomatic use by the Emperor, State guests, and ambassadors. Crossing through it is part of ceremony. The other two northern gates are for workers and guests. But, this was 80 years ago, post-war, and technically he had official approval from MacArthur making Fellers and extension of MacArthur whom the Japanese government viewed as the highest order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accuracy v. Story Telling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Emperor takes a lot of liberties with history in order to tell its story. Some of the smaller ones have been covered already, but the biggest inaccuracy is the love story between Fellers and Shimada Aya. Their story is completely fictional as Fellers was already married to Dorothy Dysart in 1925. They stayed married with 3 children until Feller's death in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall love story was most likely added to make the story relatable to general audience. Do people really want another boring historical drama based on facts? If Fellers has "love" for Japan, we gotta show that love somehow. Love for a woman is the easiest way to do this. Plus, people like a good tragic love story. Let's do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/vlcsnap-2024-08-04-15h06m06s785_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics hated this part of the story because it was so cliche. They also felt that the film focused on their love story too much when they had a wealth of history to draw story from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, for someone that knows nothing of the subject matter, I think the movie does well portraying the events in the film and introducing the audience to these events that were pivotal in created modern Japan. It also does well introducing people to some parts of Japanese culture they probably aren't familiar with. So many war movies focus on heroes in battle and show the horror of war. Very very few films focus on creating peace through reconciliation rather than fighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emperor is a fantastic under appreciated film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Imperial Palace &lt;span class='ja'&gt;皇居&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After showing the palace guards MacArthur's approval, Fellers enters the Palace and interviews Sekiya. Through researching these locations, I noticed that the Imperial Palace offered tours. Unfortunately, these tours are only outside the palace buildings. But, they're still within the palace grounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could make reservations, but the majority of people just show up. They allow the first 300 people who show up an hour before the tour to join.

The tour began at 10:00am, but required some preparation prior to starting. You needed to fill out an application or registration for any security problems. And they began handing out numbers and applications at 9:00am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5351_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5352_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not wanting to miss the chance of taking a tour of the palace grounds, I showed up around 7:20am to take photos of the Dai-Ichi Life building, walk to the Sei-mon Gate as Fellers did in the film, take more photos, and then walk to the Kikyo-mon Gate where the line-up began. I was the second person in line starting at 8:00am. The other dude said he arrived around 7:30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friends showed up around 8:45am with around 120 people in the line? So, ultimately, I didn't have to be so afraid of missing this chance. But, it was alright. Around 9:30am, they allowed tour members to enter the Kikyo-mon Gate and wait at the visitor center for orientation. They explained the route of the tour, and had pamphlets available. Tour guides were available in 5 different languages: English, Spanish, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. Although, you could also scan a QR code to listen to all the details yourself. A small gift shop was also located in the visitor center, so you can buy random stuff with the imperial seal on it. I bought a small guidebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are scan of pamphlets and that guidebook:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TqPKGJJ9Hq8Pqxe2jRnIrjD9fPvh5TO6/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-english.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TuxcHMRh9Sb4yatSh7M0MIhu9cnnNKqs/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-pamphlet-japanese.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ttu2vJrrXWi6_sLzSJbsBhbTTk8AwTVX/view?usp=sharing"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/imperial-palace-book.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortened Tour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the summer heat, tours were only offered in the morning, and the tour today was cut short. The normal tour of 75 minutes was cut down to 45 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall tour starts from the visitor center, travels down the road passed the Fujimi-yagura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;富士見櫓&lt;/span&gt;, passed the Imperial Household building, the main Imperial Palace, and over the Nijuu-bashi bridge &lt;span class='ja'&gt;二重橋&lt;/span&gt;. From the bridge, the tour goes back to the Imperial Palace, behind the Imperial Household building, along the Lotus moat, and back to the Visitor center. Our cut tour just skipped the walk behind the Household building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Niju-bashi Bridge &lt;span class='ja'&gt;二重橋&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to walk over the Niju-bashi and viewing the Sei-mon Gate and Bridge from the reverse was neat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5439_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5433_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a really great photo would be from someone standing outside of the Imperial Palace with their camera focused on the Niju-bashi Bridge. Perhaps both a semi-wide shot and a zoomed-in close up. You might need a camera with a strong zoom lens. Then, put your friend or partner on the tour. Have them wait around until the tour clears the bridge so they're the last person off the bridge. As they exit, face the camera for a couple good shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would take a bit of preparation and patience, but it could be worth it. :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tour&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the tour was fine. Sharing the tour with 300+ people means barely being able to hear the tour guide over constant talking. Everyone was taking the same photos, too, so not particularly unique. Occasionally, someone would step on something forbidden and get yelled at. Once or twice, it seemed like someone important was in a car that drove by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Imperial Palace reminds me a lot of the Imperial Palace in Kyoto. Both are the center pieces of ancient government in their cities, but they aren't represented by a massive multi-storied castle like Himeiji or Matsumoto. Though, I suppose the Emperor would want to be shown as modest. The Emperor of Japan isn't known for flaunting wealth and status over the citizens of their country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose the East Palace Gardens are meant to show off the beauty of the palace. Those are also within the palace grounds, but are freely open to the public most days. We skipped that, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240802_imperial/IMG_5323_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think the view of Fushimi-yagura with the Sei-mon Gate and bridges together ends up the most scenic area of the palace, which is probably why the used it for the film. If you have time, I think the tour is worthwhile, but if you only have a few days in Tokyo and time is short, you could take a look around the outside and be satisfied enough. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/emperor-and-the-imperial-palace</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/emperor-and-the-imperial-palace</link><category>Film &amp; TV</category><category>Media</category><category>Japan</category><category>Travel</category></item><item><title>Ema Market at Yamazakura 山桜神社</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Ema &lt;span class='ja'&gt;絵馬&lt;/span&gt; are horse paintings created at the height of summer in Takayama. People have these paintings created to bring luck and protection to a person's family or business through the upcoming year. This tradition began several hundred years ago, when farmers would bring their horses to the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/matsukura-and-emaichi" title="http://theschlock.com/matsukura-and-emaichi"&gt;Matsukura Kannon Temple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class='ja'&gt;松倉観音&lt;/span&gt; on nearby Matsukura mountain to pray to Kannon for their protection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/230801_harayama/IMG_5960_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Matsukura Kannon Temple was first established in the 1690s by a Buddhist Monk named Tenden Koutou &lt;span class='ja'&gt;天電高幢&lt;/span&gt;. Kannon is a Buddhist with six transformations, and the Matsukura Temple specifically worships Bato Kannon  &lt;span class='ja'&gt;馬頭観音&lt;/span&gt;, the horse-headed transformation of Kannon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, the Hida region has been populated by farmers, so horses were a very important part of their lives. They were used in their farm work for cultivating their fields and transporting food to town. They were also needed to travel the long distance up north or down south. People considered them part of their family. As such, their stables were connected to their houses at the front door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each year on July 9th, people would bring their horses to the Matsukura Temple to have their horse blessed by the monks of Bato Kannon. 400 years ago, traveling up the Matsukura mountain to reach the temple was difficult, and horses were often injured. As the custom grew in popularity, it became even more troublesome to bring horses up the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, Emas &lt;span class='ja'&gt;絵馬&lt;/span&gt; were created. Rather than bringing your physical horse up the mountain, you could buy a painting of your horse, have the monks bless the painting, and receive the same protection and fortune. People would hang the painting near their front door, near their horse's stable. Over time, these paintings have come to represent general good luck. As the horse faces inwards, it would bring you good luck to your home or business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/ema-paintings" title="http://theschlock.com/ema-paintings"&gt;previous years&lt;/a&gt;, I've gone up the Matsukura mountain to visit the Kannon Temple and get a horse painting. But, that's not the only place that makes these paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yamazakura Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山桜神社&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamazakura Shrine is a small shrine on Honmachi street, one of the main streets in Takayama. It is squished between two restaurants. Despite being centrally located, it's perhaps more annoying to reach than the Kannon Temple on the mountain because there's no parking (for free) around the area. Although old people just park in the middle of the street anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5713_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamazakura Shrine is named after a local horse that became a legend. Yamazakura &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山桜&lt;/span&gt; was born in the town of Nyukawa (NE town of Takayama) and became the horse of Kanamori Yorinao &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森頼直&lt;/span&gt;, the reigning ruler of Takayama at the time, great grandson of Kanamori Nagachika &lt;span class='ja'&gt;金森長近&lt;/span&gt;, who established modern Takayama. Yorinao was in Edo when the Great Fire of Edo happened in 1657. Yorinao was completely engulfed in flames in his guest house. The story goes that Yamazakura burst through the door allowing Yorinao to get on his back. The horse rushed out of the building and leaped into the river extinguishing the flames saving his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yorinao was so grateful to his horse. He established the horse's stable in downtown Takayama on Honmachi street so the people of Takayama would look after him and treat him with respect. After Yamazakura's death, he was cremated and ashes spread at the foot of Mt. Matsukura on the path to the Kannon Temple. At the location of the stable, Yamazakura Shrine &lt;span class='ja'&gt;山桜神社&lt;/span&gt; was established. Besides praying to Bato Kannon for protection and prosperity, the shrine specializes in protection from fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ema Market &lt;span class='ja'&gt;絵馬市&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, the Yamazakura Shrine advertises in the town newsletter and I often see these advertisements around the shrine when I drive by. Rather than go to Matsukura Kannon, I wanted to visit a different Ema distributer this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p class="img"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VoPxwlgiZ61dJUmk5nqaHJUmoVaAEdvI/view?usp=drive_link"&gt;&lt;img style="height: 724px; width: 512; text-align: center;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/image/hosted/240807_emaichi.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yamazakura and Bato Kannon are celebrated on August 8th, 9th, and 10th each year at the Yamazakura shrine, but the shrine is open from August 1st to 10th at 10am to 3pm each day. I had time to visit on August 7th before class in the evening. You're able to make an order &lt;a href="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html" title="https://honmachi-2chome.jp/bato-ema/index.html"&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; prior to visiting. But, if you just show up, they don't have a standard order form, like the Kannon temple. You just tell them your name, the Ema size, what color (black/white), and which way it should face (left/right). The small painting was 1800yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the shrine is so small, they only let a few people in at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5720_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5721_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few different designs beyond just the color of the horse, I think for different luck. I just went with the green one because it looked pretty and unconventional. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, because the shrine is so narrow and demand is somewhat high, I had to wait outside for them to finish painting my name, blessing, and stamping all the protections on the painting. I didn't have to wait too long, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5727.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5727.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5727_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5727_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240807_emaichi/IMG_5727_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They didn't write the date on the painting, which was common with the Ema from Matsukura Kannon. But! My luck has been renewed for yet another year. This time with extra fire protection.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 08 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/ema-market-at-yamazakura</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/ema-market-at-yamazakura</link><category>Hida Takayama</category><category>Japan</category></item><item><title>MemCard Pro2 for Playstation 2</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Late last year, English gaming company 8bitmods released a device called the &lt;b&gt;MemCard Pro 2&lt;/b&gt;. It is advertised as "the last memory card you'll ever need." It works for both Playstation 1 and Playstation 2, and it stores all of its data for memory on an SD card. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5034_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After putting together my &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="http://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;Playstation 2 set up&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted some way of being able to backup all of my save data from my decade of playing the Playstation 1 and 2. Having a memory card that uses an SD card was what I wanted, and I found this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, it does MUCH more than just store save files on an SD card. It has a paging system, so you can easily create a new card with the press of a button. It identifies games with Game Id, so it can create unique memory cards for each game. And the card has Wifi, so all of its functions can be controlled by a web interface!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Updating&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before doing anything, you need an SD card. Each PS2 memory card is 8mb so even having an SD card with 128gb of space is massive over kill. I bought a 64gb Samsung card for around $10 since it seemed to be the cheapest option. 32gb cards were available, but they were around the same price. May as well get a slightly large one. The SD card must be formatted either FAT32 or ExFat. I went with ExFat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the card ready to go, the next necessary step is firmware. You should update to the most recent version for access to all of the current features. Here's the link to the firmware:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public" title="https://install.appcenter.ms/orgs/beta-ucu9/apps/memcard-pro2/distribution_groups/public"&gt;Latest Firmware Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put the SD card in the MemCard and put the MemCard in the PS2. Power it on, and it'll start updating. When finished, it is ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wi-Fi&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may think that Wi-Fi is unnecessary for a memory card, but you have so many more methods of control than being limited to the 2-button, small screen interface attached to the PS2. When you want to change card, you can easily do it with a scroll and a click in a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up the Wi-Fi has a few steps that are pretty easy. First, you need to hold down the Left button and release to enter the Menu. Click down to Wi-Fi and select it. You'll be given an IP address. Now, the memcard pro is broadcasting as an access point. It wants you to connect to the access point and visit the webpage at that IP address. Going to that IP address will open a webpage to complete the Wi-Fi set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5040_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5041_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5043_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5045_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Setup Wizard, you'll choose a Wi-Fi network to connect to. From there, the Memcard will connect to the network, and have another IP address. Any device that is on your network can navigate to that IP address in a browser and be able to manage the data and settings on the Memcard Pro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5050_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5052_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the Browser you can easily select which memory card should be used and quickly change cards, too. You can further set up which memory card should be selected by default when the console powers up. And, you can set up cloud backup with Google Drive. You can also update the firmware from here, too, rather than doing it manually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Save Management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the Memcard is identifying games using Game_Id. Every disc printed and created for a Playstation 1 and 2 has a unique Game_Id associated with it and the Memcard can identify this ID and automatically create or switch to a virtual memory card used only for that game. It does this by default, but you can change this behavior in the settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means that you don't need to worry about trying to find which cards have which saves. You also don't have to worry about space on a card because other games won't be there to fill the space. And, even if you do save a lot in one game and use up all of the space, you can create a new page and have up to 8 memory cards for each game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All memory cards are stored as virtual drives in the &lt;code&gt;mcd&lt;/code&gt; format on the SD card. Unfortunately, you can't modify the contents of the card directly on a PC. So, if you want to add stuff on the card directly, you still need to use uLaunchELF on the PS2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There might be something out there that will mount of the drive and give you access because people have written scripts and programs that access the contents of the cards for Save Splitting. But, I haven't found anything yet. Save Splitting is useful when moving the contents of your current memory card stash into the Memcard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transferring Old Memory Cards&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an old plastic bag full of memory cards from the late 90s and 2000s. The bulk of these are Playstation 1 cards, but there are some Playstation 2 cards, too. As well as Dreamcast, N64, and Gamecube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_1516_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5059_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5054_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, I have eleven Playstation 1 cards, a Pocketstation, and six Playstation 2 cards. I want to move all of this data onto my SD card. It'd be nice if the Memcard Pro2 had an option to copy a Memory Card directly, but we have to copy over everything manually. From there, we have to use Save Splitting programs to separate and sort all of the saves into their own memory cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is a 2-step process for both Playstation 1 and 2, and the first step is identical for both: we need to manually transfer all Memory Card saves from one memory card to another. This is normally done using the Playstation browser, and I think it's the fastest method for Playstation 1. But for Playstation 2, it's much faster to use uLaunchELF and move all of the file contents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5078_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5080_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With uLaunchELF, &lt;code&gt;mc0&lt;/code&gt; is the memory card is slot 1, and &lt;code&gt;mc1&lt;/code&gt; is slot 2. Mark everything you want to copy with the X button, hit R1 for the menu, and select copy. Navigate to the other memory card location, hit R1 for the menu again, and select paste. Everything you selected will be copied. uLaunchELF didn't refresh when I unplugged and changed memory cards, so I had to restart uLaunchELF each time.  It's still MUCH faster than loading PS2 saves in the Browser, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all the cards copied as Virtual memory cards, we want to break out all the saves into all of their unique cards for each game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the save splitting stuff I learned from &lt;b&gt;Archades Games&lt;/b&gt; on YouTube. He has a ton of tutorials for retro gaming setups, and I followed his videos quite closely whenever I had problems.&lt;br/&gt;For PS2 saves: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAmtPF_0ij0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For PS1 saves: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAYrCiQEBr0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation 2 Save Splitting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For PS2 saves, Archades' video pointed to a dev named K3zter. He has created a save splitter script, and it's available here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/K3zter/mcp2-save-splitter" title="https://github.com/K3zter/mcp2-save-splitter"&gt;https://github.com/K3zter/mcp2-save-splitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are instructions on the page, but in order to use this, you want to download the entire contents of this repository and place them into a folder on your computer.  The script relies on program called &lt;code&gt;mymc&lt;/code&gt; created by another developer, gastroman. As the description says, you can download that program here: &lt;a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/" title="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mymc-opl/files/"&gt;sourceforget/mymc&lt;/a&gt;. All contents of mymc distribution should be placed in the &lt;code&gt;mymc&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The save-splitter distribution has an &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; and an &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; folder. Pretty self-explanatory. Put all your saves in the import folder, run the script, and all of the split saves will be in the export folder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script is run from a PowerShell instance and you need to Run it as an Administrator, since it'll be moving and editing files. Once opened, navigate to the script's location, and execute the script by typing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;.\split.ps1&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The script may not run at first because Windows doesn't want you to run scripts that change the contents of your computer without you understanding what you're actually doing. Archades' video points to a &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10635/why-are-my-powershell-scripts-not-running" title="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10635/why-are-my-powershell-scripts-not-running"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; question asking how to get around this. I typed in the following to get this script working:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted&lt;br/&gt;Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5091.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5091.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5091_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5091_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5091_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5097.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5097.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5097_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5097_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5097_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With all restrictions removed, the script was run and it processed all memory cards and save files in the import directory, and spit out individual cards for each game in the export directory. With all the saves split, all folders in the export directory should be moved into the &lt;code&gt;PS2&lt;/code&gt; folder on the MemCard's SD card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation 1 Save Splitting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;PS1 saves have a similar process. Archades' video pointed to the save splitter program was written by Bodgit, and it's available here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro" title="https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro"&gt;https://github.com/bodgit/memcardpro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to do a little more work compared with the PS2 save splitter, but we don't have to deal with PowerShell and any of its restrictions. Also, this has linux and darwin versions, so I could run it on my MacBook. But, the PC is already open, so I'll just use the Windows version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time, we're executing the script from the Command Line (or Command Prompt). Because of this, we need to add a bunch of arguments to the execution code. You also need to make your own export folder. In the same folder with the program, I made a folder called &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt;. I also made an &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; folder, but it's not necessary. For the command line, you'll need to type in this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;memcardpro split export import/MemoryCard?-?.mcd&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to change the question marks in that command to the actual filename. They do not act as wild cards. Although, there is probably something you could use as a wild card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5082.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5082.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5082_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5082_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5082_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5084.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5084.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5084_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5084_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5084_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the execution is complete, the export folder will be filled with split memory card images. Copy all of these into the &lt;code&gt;PS1&lt;/code&gt; folder of the MemCard's SD card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Saves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, I have saves for 53 Playstation 1 games and 89 Playstation 2 games. I thought it'd be more, but it makes sense looking at my &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/apps/games/" title="http://theschlock.com/apps/games/"&gt;Video Game Collection&lt;/a&gt;. I own 65 ps1 games and 84 ps2 games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've uploaded all of my saves to my GitHub page for my &lt;a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/tree/master/mcp2" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/tree/master/mcp2"&gt;OPL load out&lt;/a&gt;, but it's not particularly reader friendly. So, I added Save Icons to my &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/apps/ps2" title="http://theschlock.com/apps/ps2"&gt;Playstation 2 Game Inventory&lt;/a&gt; and to the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/apps/games/" title="http://theschlock.com/apps/games/"&gt;Video Game Collection&lt;/a&gt;, so as you browse all of the games I put on my PS2, you can see which games have saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the Memcard saves each card as a virtual memory card in the &lt;code&gt;mc2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;mcd&lt;/code&gt; formats, so you'll need to do some processing to extract the individual saves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the Memcard works! All of my saves from 20 years ago or more are all in tact, including my Final Fantasy X saves that I put over 200 combined hours into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5149.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5149.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5149_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5149_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5149_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5101.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5101.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5101_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5101_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5101_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free McBoot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While cataloging all of my game saves is great, we need Free McBoot on this thing to launch Open PS2 Loader is play games on our hard drive or network server. Again, the Memcard Pro acts like any PS2 Memory Card, so moving stuff on an empty card using uLaunchELF works the same as any other memory card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a bit of a chicken/egg scenario because you need to use uLaunchELF to install Free McBoot on a memory card. But, you can't run uLaunchELF unless you already have a memory card with Free McBoot. (Or you have a DVD with uLaunchELF burned on it) One of Archades' videos had a link to a Memcard image with everything already installed. I made a few updates, and you can download my FreeMcBoot memory card image here: &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JqGUIB73w_NrLc7JKU3fX0a0TVXIgKQ3/view" title="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JqGUIB73w_NrLc7JKU3fX0a0TVXIgKQ3/view"&gt;googleDrive/MemoryCard1-1.mc2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5172.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5172.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5172_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5172_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240801_memcard/IMG_5172_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Archades' image, there is wLaunchELF (updated uLaunchELF), and OPL with Game ID code enabled, plus Grimdoomer's OPL fork. I added two more programs: OPL Anniversary edition, which supports old Playstation 1 games, and the "latest" version of OPL 1.2 beta rom Github.  The Game ID OPL and Latest OPL are basically the same, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because that Memory Card image is the one that I actually use, it has all of my configuration details included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love the Memcard Pro2. It is the perfect way of preserving all of your saves from the past and managing them today, as long as you're running them on original hardware. That's really the one downside. If you're emulating games on PC or some other device, the Memcard Pro2 is good for extracting the saves, but you won't need it beyond that. For continued support, it works best when actually using a Playstation 2. My set up has a Playstation 2 at its heart, so it's perfect for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're still playing games on an actual Playstation 2, I would recommend the Memcard as a must buy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2</link><category>Games</category><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>Using the OSSC with the PS2</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The OSSC stands for Open Source Scan Converter. It's a device created from a community standard that converts analog video signals into digital signals, primarily for retro video game consoles. It has 3 inputs, SCART, component, and VGA, and will output HDMI. I'm primary using this with a Playstation 2, but the Analogue Pocket's Analogizer is also hooked up to it. I recently got mine from AliExpress for $90. Then I bought an acrylic outer case for $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The era of the Playstation 2 was the last video game generation to use analog video signals as a standard. Starting with the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360, consoles natively supported HDMI, and now its standard on absolutely everything. Prior to HDMI, RCA composite cables were standard in North America and Japan, while SCART was standard in Europe. But, for North America, the highest quality video you could get used RGB composite cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation 2 Component Cables&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Playstation 2, the official component cables are one of the best options. But the actual official ones are hard to find and usually expensive. Also, there are many bootlegs cables being sold as official. Signal integrity is very important to analog video, so cheap cables can eat away at the quality. So, the actual best PS2 video cables on the market are the cables from Retrovision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5676_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think they look cheap on the outside, but the internals are not. The inner components are perfectly shielded and expertly crafted to ensure the highest quality, strongest signal possible from source to destination. They were $30 on Amazon, not too much more expensive than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Signals and Resolutions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, by default, the Playstation 2 outputs a 480i resolution. In general, this is a 640x480 resolution drawn with interlacing. I'm not an expert, but I have come to understand that interlacing draws the video with overlapping alternating lines. A complete single frame is split into two images alternatingly drawn on top of each other, which creates two frames instead one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern TVs with HDMI use progressive scan to draw the image on a TV. A single frame is drawn from top to bottom in order without alternating lines. Some Playstation 2 games have the option of output 480p, where p stands for progressive. The OSSC loves a 480p signal because, even though it is being passed as an analog signal, it's in a digital format, and that's what modern TVs want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 480i signal is more annoying. The OSSC needs to convert the interlaced signals into progressive, and it uses bob deinterlacing to do this. Bob deinterlacing takes the half-drawn image from the first frame and treats it as progressive. It's only 240 tall, so it doubles the height. Then it does the same with the next frame, the other half of the image. Another name for this technique is line doubling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, we want to set up the OSSC to handle &lt;b&gt;480p&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;480i&lt;/b&gt; signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have made a list of all Playstation 2 games that support 480p (and other resolutions) and how to enable it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes" title="https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes"&gt;https://en.everybodywiki.com/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_with_alternative_display_modes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;480p Signals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, if a game supports 480p (or any progressive scan format), we want to use it. Using OPL, there's a way to force this. GSM, or &lt;b&gt;Graphics Synthesizer Mode Selector&lt;/b&gt;, is another unofficial PS2 app that works with OPL. When choosing a game in OPL, you can hit &lt;code&gt;triangle&lt;/code&gt; to enter the Game Settings menu. Then enter the GSM Settings menu. For 480p available games, enable GSM and switch the "Mode" to 480p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1509_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to save the Game Settings! Now, when you launch the game, it will automatically run in 480p.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;OSSC Settings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; I'm still trying to find the best settings. Please check back later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/using-ossc-with-ps2</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/using-ossc-with-ps2</link><category>Games</category><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>Playstation 1 Games on PS2 OPL</title><description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best features of the Playstation 2 on its release was backwards compatibility with Playstation 1 games. In those recent years, no home console had been backwards compatible with its predecessor, mainly because of cartridges. So having a new console being able to play your current game library was a massive boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was accomplished by including the original Playstation hardware inside of the Playstation 2. Over time, this extra hardware was shrunk, and eventually relegated to software emulation, which wasn't perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, with getting OPL and a Games server working for the Playstation 2, I wanted Playstation 1 working in the same way. The overall process for Playstation 1 games is similar to Playstation 2 games, but the steps are different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is my set up for the Playstation 2 with OPL, the file server, and everything else:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="http://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;/returning-to-the-playstation-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;POPStarter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the Playstation 2 has the Playstation 1 hardware for games, the games will be run in software. Unfortunately, there's no way around this. &lt;b&gt;POPS&lt;/b&gt; is Sony's Playstation 1 emulator that runs on the ps2, and OPL's method of using this is called POPStarter. It stands for Playstation One Portable Station, probably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: There are two ways of setting up Playstation 1 games and POPstarter using OPL and I'm using the old way. This way is only compatible using OPL Anniversary Edition. The latest versions of OPL have removed this method of execution for a newer method which has a slightly better success rate for compatibility. I'm not sure if it works through SMB, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, my Playstation 2 setup is streaming games through the ethernet port using an SMB server hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3. I need to add POPStarter configuration on my memory card with Free McBoot. And then, there are some additional files required for the file server along with the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;POPSTARTER Configuration for the Memory Card&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because I'm running Playstation 1 games from the SMB File Share, I needed to download a specific POPStarter setup for the memory card. I downloaded &lt;b&gt;POPSTARTER.zip&lt;/b&gt; found on the following page: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/"&gt;https://www.psx-place.com/resources/popstarter.683/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When unzipped it will give a &lt;code&gt;POPSTARTER&lt;/code&gt; folder. This entire folder will be copied to the Free McBoot memory card, but we need to change two things first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to change the &lt;code&gt;IPCONFIG.DAT&lt;/code&gt; file. This contains the ip details of the PS2. By default, here are the file contents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;PS2-IP-ADDRESS NETMASK GATEWAY&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These details are all found in the Network Settings of OPL. The PS2-IP-ADDRESS is the IP address of the PS2 on the network. The Netmask is the same one in OPL. And the Gateway is the IP address of the File server. All of these are listed in OPL's Network Config menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: Originally, my Playstation 2 IP address was &lt;code&gt;192.168.0.10&lt;/code&gt;. POPS does not like it when the IPs of the Playstation 2 and the File Server are on different subnets, so I changed the PS2's IP address in OPL to &lt;code&gt;192.168.2.10&lt;/code&gt;. This solved my problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is my completed file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;192.168.2.10 255.255.255.0 192.168.2.1&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to change &lt;code&gt;SMBCONFIG.DAT&lt;/code&gt;. This tells popstarter where the files are located on the network. OPL knows where the files are, but it doesn't tell POPS this information when it launches, so we need to add this information here. By default, here are the file contents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;PC-IP-ADDRESS PS2SMB&lt;br/&gt;username&lt;br/&gt;password&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's the server's IP address, the server's folder name, and the login details. I'm using the SMB Share setup on the Raspberry Pi, so here are my details:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;192.168.2.1 share&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no login details, so those lines are omitted. The share on the Pi is just &lt;code&gt;share&lt;/code&gt;, and it's running on that IP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Memory Card Installation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;POPSTARTER&lt;/code&gt; folder and all of its contents will be copied to the Memory Card with Free McBoot. To do this, we'll need to put all these files on a simple USB Drive and plug that directly into a USB slot of the PS2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After turning on the PS2 with Free McBoot, you'll need to open uLaunchELF, which is a file browser for the Playstation 2. The drive marked &lt;code&gt;mass&lt;/code&gt; is your USB drive, &lt;code&gt;mc0&lt;/code&gt; is the memory card in the first slot, and &lt;code&gt;mc1&lt;/code&gt; is the memory card in the second slot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1510_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code&gt;mass&lt;/code&gt;, select (mark) your &lt;code&gt;POPSTARTER&lt;/code&gt; folder, hit &lt;code&gt;R1&lt;/code&gt; to pull up the menu, and select copy. Navigate to &lt;code&gt;mc0&lt;/code&gt; for your Free McBoot card, hit &lt;code&gt;R1&lt;/code&gt; again, and select paste. This will copy your &lt;code&gt;POPSTARTER&lt;/code&gt; folder to the memory card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your memory card setup is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;File Server Files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the file server, Playstation 1 games are put in the &lt;code&gt;POPS&lt;/code&gt; folder, but we need another file for the emulator to work, the emulator itself! The file for the actual emulator is named &lt;code&gt;POPS_IOX.PAK&lt;/code&gt;. It's not too difficult to find through a Google search, but this file contains copyrighted information by Sony, so search at your own risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last file we're going to need is &lt;code&gt;POPSTARTER.ELF&lt;/code&gt;. ELF files are applications that run on the Playstation 2, and this is POPStarter application that runs the emulator. When you select a game in OPL, it will open that game with this application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With everything set up, now we need some games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;POPStarter and OPL requires Playstation 1 Games in the VCD format and using the same filename format as PS2 games. When you illegally download any Playstation 1 game, it'll most likely be in the bin/cue format. So, you'll need to convert them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best program to do this with is called &lt;b&gt;PFS BatchKit Manager&lt;/b&gt;. It can be found on GitHub here:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager" title="https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager"&gt;https://github.com/GDX-X/PFS-BatchKit-Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PFS BatchKit Manager is a command line program for Windows, so Windows might complain when you try to open it. It should run within your OPL folder on your File server. Conversions are found under the Advanced Menu. Follow this route:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt; -&gt; 10. Advanced Menu&lt;br/&gt; -&gt; 1. Conversion&lt;br/&gt; -&gt; 1. Convert .bin to .vcd&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1495_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will search the &lt;code&gt;POPS&lt;/code&gt; folder for any bin/cue files, and process them. First, it'll combine all the bin files into a single bin file. Then it will convert to vcd. PFS BatchKit Manager will also rename your files with the Disc ID in the front and with the correct game name from their database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I've had the process fail once or twice on large batches of files, so I always convert a few at a time. It can sometimes take a while, too, so I prefer going bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will complete the process for single disc games. You can open OPL Manager to double check the file names are correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-Disc Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For games with multiple discs, there is one more step to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POPStarter doesn't read the PS2's memory card, so it will create a virtual memory card for saving. Memory card files are stored/indexed by Game Id, and this is problem with multi-disc games because each CD has its own Game Id.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuration files must be set up to tell POPStarter you are running a multi-disc game. This will allow memory card sharing among each disc AND it will allow you to swap game discs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a script you can download called &lt;b&gt;DISCS_POOPER.cmd&lt;/b&gt;, also Windows only. Place this script in the same folder with all the discs of a multi-disc game, run the script, and it will create the necessary sub folders and the configuration files needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1499_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find this by searching around, but I have a copy of it on my GitHub:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/blob/03bb3180655a99fb3962c2f889c88d85d5d1404f/POPS/DISCS_POOPER.cmd" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/blob/03bb3180655a99fb3962c2f889c88d85d5d1404f/POPS/DISCS_POOPER.cmd"&gt;github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout/DISCS_POOPER.cmd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put these folders and games in the &lt;code&gt;POPS&lt;/code&gt; folder of your file server, and you're good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Multi-Disc Controls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are button commands used for multi-disc games to simulate opening the disc tray, inserting a different disc, and closing the tray. These commands are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;·    To open the lid: Select + L2 + R2 + Triangle&lt;br/&gt;·    To insert Disc 1: Select + L2 + R2 + Up&lt;br/&gt;·    To insert Disc 2: Select + L2 + R2 + Right&lt;br/&gt;·    To insert Disc 3: Select + L2 + R2 + Down&lt;br/&gt;·    To insert Disc 4: Select + L2 + R2 + Left&lt;br/&gt;·    To close the lid: Select + L2 + R2 + Square&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These commands were found on this page: &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/multi-disc" title="https://bitbucket.org/ShaolinAssassin/popstarter-documentation-stuff/wiki/multi-disc"&gt;bitbucket.org/popstarter/multi-disc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Execution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Playstation 1 games put in the &lt;code&gt;POPS&lt;/code&gt; folder, they will show up in OPL under the Playstation menu. Selecting them will run POPStarter. Unfortunately, even with everything set up correctly, not all games work with POPS. Some games won't open. Some games will open, but then lock up after the game starts. Other games will run with audio stuttering or graphics stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a Google Doc where people have submitted their compatibility issues with POPS, so prior to trying, you can check whether or not a game works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ERB4SIXTTgsUCqOcoRPIseh2jnRfZWnGITOd_qz7s8E/edit?pli=1&amp;pli=1&amp;gid=1#gid=1" title="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ERB4SIXTTgsUCqOcoRPIseh2jnRfZWnGITOd_qz7s8E/edit?pli=1&amp;pli=1&amp;gid=1#gid=1"&gt;POPStarter Playstation Compatibility Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Final Fantasy VIII crashes at the beginning when trying to load the second cutscene in the game. :(   But other games, such as Super Puzzle Fighter II, work perfectly for POPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1442.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1442.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1442_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1442_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1442_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Almost Perfect&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, it's not the perfect solution to playing Playstation 1 games that I want. But, it works for many games, and they can live alongside the Playstation 2 games on my file server. I don't need another process for them to work. Most of the incompatible games that I want to play, I have physical copies of anyways.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl</link><category>Games</category><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>Returning to the Playstation 2</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Lately I have revisited the Playstation 2, my favorite console of all time. I played the PS2 for hours and hours during college, made some amazing friends through playing games, and have amazing memories of those times. So, I wanted to relive those memories as well as return to a time when video games began evolving into something with more complexity, both for story and gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to return to the PS2 in the same way I've come back to other retro consoles thanks to the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket" title="http://theschlock.com/analogue-pocket"&gt;Analogue Pocket&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to have a significant library of games that could easily be stored and sifted through digitally, as well as having them look their best on a modern TV. The PS2 is also backwards compatible with Playstation 1 games, so I wanted to be able to play those too. After messing around with things for about a month, I finally have everything set up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5687_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall set up isn't too complicated, but it has a bunch of parts required for everything to work together. To quickly explain, I'm using a memory card with Free McBoot on an original Playstation 2 slim to run Open PS2 Loader. I have a Raspberry Pi acting a network file server that OPL is connecting to in order to load games. I have a 4tb hard drive connected to the Raspberry Pi where all of the games are stored. And, the PS2 is using component video cables connected to an OSSC to digitize the video and send it to my modern TV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this was inspired by another one of Tito's YouTube videos: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVCFbJCPtO8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the center of the entire set up is an actual Playstation 2. None of this entire process modifies the original console whatsoever. Everything extra can be unplugged from the Playstation 2, and it'll be the same as it was 20 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My original Playstation 2 Slim is 10,000km away back in the United States, so I bought a Japanese Slim from Yahoo Auctions. For the best possible compatibility, people had recommended the original Slim release, so I bought a SCPH-70000 model. It was really cheap at only 3000yen, and it came with the vertical stand and a few games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5708_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In later revisions of the Playstation Slim, they moved Playstation 1 processing into software rather than hardware. They also removed legacy hard drive support, which isn't even available for the Slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Free McBoot Memory Card&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order for any of this to work, we need access to the Playstation 2's file system and be able to run unofficial applications. In particular, we need to be able to run &lt;b&gt;Open PS2 Loader&lt;/b&gt;. Creating your own Free McBoot memory card from complete scratch has a lot of steps, but these days, you can easily buy a pre-built Free McBoot memory card from Amazon. I bought one from Amazon JP for only 1500yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_5131_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Official Playstation 2 memory cards have the Magic Gate branding on them, which acts like a Seal of Approval ensuring that all games are compatible with it. This card doesn't have such approval and it's also 64mb compared to the official 8mb limit. Because of this, some games don't like it. We Love Katamari in particular has some saving problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One really nice thing about this card is that it came with absolutely everything installed on it. It already had OPL, all of the retro game emulators, and other necessary applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;MemCard Pro2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going one step further, 8bitmods released a device called the MemCard Pro2, which they restocked a month or two after my initial setup was complete. It is advertised as the "the last memory card you'll ever need," and with this, I no longer need a dedicated memory card with Free McBoot. Although, having an extra card with Free McBoot is handy when moving files around from Memory Card to Memory Card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the details for the Memcard Pro2 are discussed in another post: &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2" title="http://theschlock.com/memcard-pro2-for-ps2"&gt;/memcard-pro2-for-ps2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Raspberry Pi 3 w/ SMB Share&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the hardware center is the Playstation 2 itself, the software center is the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi acts as a File Server and it is directly connected to the PS2 using an ethernet cable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't own a Raspberry Pi, so I went to Yahoo Auctions again to find a cheap one. I found a Raspberry Pi 3 with heatsinks installed and an AC adapter for 4000yen. Good deal!  Later, I bought an acrylic case with a fan for only $4 from AliExpress. Also, I had an extra LCD Monitor and a extra keyboard, so I'm using those with it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1444_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1452_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to set up the SMB Share, you need to flash an SD card with the Playstation SMB Share. This image is found here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare" title="https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare"&gt;https://github.com/toolboc/psx-pi-smbshare&lt;/a&gt;. I used a program called balenaEtcher to put this image on one of my extra micro SD cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the initial power-up, it takes a little time to do some set-up, but eventually you'll be given a log in prompt. This happens every time the Raspberry Pi boots up. The default username is &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt; and the default password is &lt;code&gt;raspberry&lt;/code&gt;. With everything set up, you'll need IP information for OPL's connection. Type in &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; and you'll be given the network data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1433_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;inet 192.168.2.1  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.2.255&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the line that we care about. The Pi's IP address is &lt;code&gt;192.168.2.1&lt;/code&gt;. To turn off the Raspberry Pi, type &lt;code&gt;sudo shutdown -h now&lt;/code&gt;. It will shutdown, but then you'll need to unplug it. There's no actual on/off switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; the Raspberry Pi doesn't like to plug and play. Anything you have plugged in on start up, it will auto mount, but if you plug in something after it has already been turned on, you need to manually mount the device, whether it's a keyboard, a monitor, or a usb drive. Plug in everything before you give it power for best results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;USB Drive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SMB Server expects a USB device plugged in the Raspberry Pi to serve files from, and the device must be formatted exFat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every one recommends to use a USB Flash Drive, but standard USB Flash Drives aren't able to scale. They're fine if you want to have a couple of games, but I want to have a large library of games. Modern USB hard drives are pretty big. In fact, I have a few 5tb SSD drives for backing up files. But these are powered through USB. The Raspberry Pi uses a measly amount of power so it can't power anything through USB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had an older 4tb Western Digital hard drive with an actual hard disk, not a solid state or a flash drive. This drive has its own power connection separate from USB. By plugging this in and turning it on before powering on the Raspberry Pi, it works just like any other USB storage device. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Games and OPL Manager&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical chain between the Playstation 2 and the games is complete, but there are two more steps. First off, we need some games. You can illegally download games for several different places online. These files come in two different flavors: ISOs and bin/cue files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open PS2 Loader&lt;/b&gt; is the UI application used on the Playstation 2 to select and run these files, so they need to be in a particular format and have a particular file naming scheme. The USB Drive also needs to be in a particular file structure for OPL to find the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OPL Manager&lt;/b&gt; is a PC program that will do all of this for us. You can download it &lt;a href="https://oplmanager.com/site/" title="https://oplmanager.com/site/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or just search on Google if the location changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When OPL Manager first starts, it will ask for a base location. For me, I use a temp location on my USB drive for a few reasons. (One) OPL Manager can take a while to load if there are a lot of games at the location. So, when using a temp location it only needs to load the few games I'm working with at the time. Likewise, these games take up a LOT of space, so (Two) I don't want to process them locally and copy them later. This takes up a lot of space on my local computer, and takes time copying to the hard drive later. I want to work with everything on the drive, and move files around on the drive after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a base location is selected, it will create all of the folders OPL requires. PS2 games will primarily go in the &lt;code&gt;DVD&lt;/code&gt; folder. The &lt;code&gt;CD&lt;/code&gt; folder is also for PS2 games that use CD format rather than DVD. This only matters when a game uses other tracks on the disk for audio. I don't think any PS2 game does this. All notable and modern games have their music baked into the game code, so the &lt;code&gt;CD&lt;/code&gt; folder can be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few other interesting folders, particular &lt;code&gt;THM&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ART&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;CFG&lt;/code&gt;. For a further description of these folders, please read my full OPL load out post: &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="http://theschlock.com/opl-theme-and-loadout"&gt;/opl-theme-and-loadout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPL only wants games in the ISO format, so you need to convert CD/Bin games to ISO. OPL Manager can do this. Choose &lt;code&gt;Disc/Convert to ISO&lt;/code&gt; under Tools, and select files from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, OPL wants a particular file format. OPL Manager will mark all the illegal filenames for you and ask you to change them. File names should start with the game's disc id, should not contain certain invalid characters, and should also not be longer than 31 characters. OPL Manager will help you make sure all of this stuff is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once all of the games are converted, I copy them into the main location and they are ready.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open PS2 Loader&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the games ready, it's time for the Playstation 2 to find them. The USB Drive is plugged into the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi is turned on and the server is running. Now, the Playstation 2 can be turned on. With the Free McBoot memory card also plugged in, Open PS2 Loader, or OPL is available from the menu. Select it, and OPL will open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it first boots up, there will be no games. There's a few things OPL does by default that we'll change later, but the first thing we'll need to do is configure the Network Settings so OPL can find the file server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hit &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; to bring up OPL settings, go to Network Config, and here is where we will enter the IP information from the Raspberry Pi we received from several steps before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1507_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the SMB Server, the PI's IP address was &lt;code&gt;192.168.2.1&lt;/code&gt;, and the "Share" folder's name is &lt;code&gt;share&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; Originally, my PS2's IP address was &lt;code&gt;192.168.0.10&lt;/code&gt;, but I changed it to &lt;code&gt;192.168.2.10&lt;/code&gt; to have the same LAN address as the Raspberry Pi. It's not necessary for OPL to work, but it is necessary for POPS to work with Playstation 1 games. Please read the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="http://theschlock.com/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl"&gt;POPS&lt;/a&gt; post for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, OPL will serve PS2 games from 3 locations: the USB drive, the hard drive, and the ethernet port. By default, it won't automatically connect to these locations. You need to hit the Circle button to connect manually. Also, the hard drive is selected by default. All of this can be changed in the OPL Setting menu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1508_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, I am displaying the Ethernet games on Start Up. Since we're not using the USB Drive and Hard Drive for games, nor are we using any Applications, I disable all 3 of these options in the menu. And for both Ethernet games and Playstation games, I have OPL connecting to these sources automatically on start up.  Now, when OPL opens all of my Playstation 2 games will be shown immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; I'm using OPL Anniversary Edition which has Playstation as a menu display. The latest versions of OPL have removed the Playstation menu and force everything to be run from the Applications menu for better compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1506_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation 1 Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can also run Playstation 1 games using OPL. As mentioned above, this is only available through OPL Anniversary Edition as a separate menu. I have detailed that process in a different post:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl" title="http://theschlock.com/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl"&gt;/playstation-games-on-ps2-opl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;OPL Themes and Metadata&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPL allows you to customize its appearance with an overall theme. You can also have artwork and metadata for all of the games. I put all of these details in a different post:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/opl-theme-and-loadout" title="http://theschlock.com/opl-theme-and-loadout"&gt;/opl-theme-and-loadout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Video Conversion and the OSSC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one final link in this entire PS2 chain, and that is the video output. The video game generation of the Playstation 2 was the final generation to output analog video by default. HDMI became the standard for the PS3 and Xbox 360, and now everything is HDMI. Without any additional modification, Component video is the highest quality available for the PS2. I'm using the Retrovision Component cables for the PS2, which are apparently the absolute best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analog video must be converted to digital, and that's where I'm using the OSSC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1348_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1439_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OSSC isn't too difficult to get working, but it can send you down a rabbit hole of optimization headaches. I made another post about making Playstation 2 games looking their best using the OSSC in other post:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/using-ossc-with-ps2" title="http://theschlock.com/using-ossc-with-ps2"&gt;/using-ossc-with-ps2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Retro Receiver and PlayStation 4 Controller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final icing on this cake is using a Playstation 4 controller on the Playstation 2. With the 8bitdo Retro Receiver controller dongle for the Playstation, you can connect almost any bluetooth controller through the controller port of the Playstation or Playstation 2, and use that to control the games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1440.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1440.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1440_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1440_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1440_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm using my &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller" title="http://theschlock.com/fixing-and-modding-ps4-controller"&gt;Playstation 4 controller&lt;/a&gt; that I fixed and slightly modified not all that long ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this is my entire chain that serves my Playstation 2 library on my modern TV. The Raspberry Pi 3 is running a local network server serving files from a 4tb hard drive across a wired LAN connection to the Playstation 2. The Playstation 2 is running OPL from the Memory Card which finds these games and will play them. The video signal is being converted by the OSSC to a modern TV. And I'm controlling it all with a bluetooth Playstation 4 controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a lot of moving parts, and each part in the chain is using its own power outlet, but it works. I can play my favorite games from 20 years ago, and plenty of others that I skipped at the time. :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2</link><category>Games</category><category>Projects</category></item><item><title>OPL Theme and Loadout</title><description>&lt;p&gt;Open PS2 Loader is an application that runs on a PS2 and allows the user to choose games with a hard drive, usb drive, or network share. Setting up games takes a bit of work, but it's overall not too difficult. I wrote about the process in another post: &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2" title="http://theschlock.com/returning-to-the-playstation-2"&gt;/returning-to-the-playstation-2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that post, I mentioned how to set up games on the file server using OPL and OPL Manager, but there's more that can be done! With games available on the backend, we want a beautiful frontend to choose our games from. This is our OPL Theme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An OPL Theme is an overall graphical layout and presentation showing off the games available. It also pulls artwork and metadata for each game. There's a default theme, but I wanted more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a quick link, here's the GitHub repo with my theme, and all artwork and metadata for my games. I've uploaded my game saves for the Memcard Pro2 here, as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout" title="https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout"&gt;https://github.com/dyreschlock/ps2-opl-loadout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Theme&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a sub-forum on PSX-Place where people have posted all of their themes. There are 72 posts with a couple of different variations of the themes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psx-place.com/forums/themes-for-opl.229/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/forums/themes-for-opl.229/"&gt;https://www.psx-place.com/forums/themes-for-opl.229/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally, I wanted to make a theme that mirrored the Analogue Pocket's interface, but I went through a bunch of these themes to see what was available. I prefer themes that are as simple as possible, and I found one that I really liked: Jonepo's N-Glass Remix, the Blur version&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/opl-theme-n-glass-remix-supports-all-opl.43565/" title="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/opl-theme-n-glass-remix-supports-all-opl.43565/"&gt;https://www.psx-place.com/threads/opl-theme-n-glass-remix-supports-all-opl.43565/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240601_ps2/IMG_1503_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a nice colored backdrop and simply displays the game list, cover art, and other menu options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;More to Come&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; I'm still working on customizing the theme and layout.

Films that end up working really well for class aren't necessarily the ones that you'd expect, nor are ones you'd really like on a personal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h28m50s628_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lights Out is PG-13, which makes the film pretty tame by horror standards. It also makes use of constant jump-scares and startles to accomplish its job of spooking the audience, a device that really undermines the weight of a truly scary moment. Overall, the acting isn't bad, but there are some goofy moments. The script is the same way. On my own, I probably would've skipped to end, halfway though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, many of these problems end up working pretty well in class. The acting is good enough to make each scene believable and understandable for students. The script pushes the story along and there aren't any glaring plot holes or problems. The jump-scares turn the movie into a game for students as they try to make their friends jump at the wrong moments. The PG-13 rating works, too, as I'm not showing gore to students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monster&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film has some unique ideas, too, bringing its monster to life and showing its limitations in a very understandable way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h15m50s506_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we learn later in the film, &lt;b&gt;Diana&lt;/b&gt; was a patient in a mental hospital over 30 years ago. She suffered from a rare skin condition which burns her skin when exposed to light. The doctors tried an experimental procedure by blasting light rays at her (good idea), which incinerated her skin and body, reducing her to ash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her spirit still remained within the mind and body of a young girl she possessed at the hospital. Now, Diana only has a physical presence in the dark and shadows. When exposed to light, she disappears. But, she's still there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do some fun things with this. A character turns off the lights in a room and she appears in the shadows confusing the person. She disappears and reappears in sync with a neon sign at night as a character realizes someone is there. Spoilers, but my favorite use of this effect is at the end when police officers try shooting her. The muzzle flash from the gun is enough to make her disappear and the bullet goes right through her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Commitment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The closest thing to a theme the film has is the idea of commitment and abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rebecca&lt;/b&gt; is the main character, played by Teresa Palmer. She is dating, not-dating her boyfriend, not-boyfriend &lt;b&gt;Bret&lt;/b&gt;, played by Alexander DiPersia. The film starts with them in her apartment at night. Bret wants to stay for the night and he wants their relationship to move forward, but Rebecca pushes him out. She doesn't even call him her boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h19m39s274_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bret unfailingly continues to support her. He brings her to the school to meet, &lt;b&gt;Martin&lt;/b&gt;, her younger half-brother. And he brings them back to their mother's house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebecca fights with her mother because she blames her for driving her father away. Her mother fights back because Rebecca ran away after her father left and wouldn't support her. Rebecca also thinks that with the death of Martin's father in the opening of the film, Martin will suffer the same way as she did as a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She takes Martin, and they leave their mother at home, crying. Once again, the mother feels betrayed by Rebecca abandoning her, and Rebecca runs away from the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h32m30s226_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the apartment, she acts like a mother to Martin. But, Bret calls her out on her behavior. In the moment, she feels betrayed by Bret for not supporting her, and she tells him to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my class, up to this point in the film, we've been doing listening exercises. Students get copies of the script with missing words and sentences. While watching the scenes, they try to catch the words, and write them into the script. But, these scenes lead us to performance tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance Tests are done in pairs of students. For this first scene, one student is Becca and one student is Bret. These tests aren't just about remembering the lines and saying them. They must express themselves using the feelings of the characters through their words, gestures, eye contact, and movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scene itself doesn't have any overwhelming gestures and movements expressing their feelings. It's almost all internal. Becca feels that she's doing the right thing by taking Martin away from her mother, and she feels hurt that Bret doesn't support her. Bret is clearly expressing his views on her actions and maybe suggesting that there's a better way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You should leave now," Becca says to end their conversation. Bret leaves as Becca stares straight, not looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h33m01s296_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/courses/lights-out" title="http://theschlock.com/courses/lights-out"&gt;Course Page&lt;/a&gt; for grading criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;Next Performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over night, Diana comes to Becca's apartment and attacks her. She survives by turning on the lights. The next morning, child services takes Martin back to his mom. Becca calls up Bret, she apologizes, and then they go to Mom's house. They break in and Becca finds the information about Diana's past and who she is. She's attacked again by Diana, but Bret saves her. They both run out of the house, as her mother arrives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m37s950_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This last scene is a much more energetic acting scene than the one from before. Both Becca and Bret are running from the house, and Becca is distraught and hysterical from her attack. Bret tries to help and understand the situation as he never saw Diana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this scene, both character's feelings and emotions are clearly visible, and students should clearly show them too through their performance. Because of Becca's hysterics, many of her words are fast and often said over Bret's. It's really important for students to act together and support each other to make the overall scene successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/lights_out/vlcsnap-2024-06-07-19h48m29s606_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class='title'&gt;&lt;b&gt;More later...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More to come&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/lights-out</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/lights-out</link><category>Film &amp; TV</category><category>Media</category><category>Teaching</category></item><item><title>Playstation 2 Game Inventory</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Playstation 2 is my favorite console of all time, and recently I've been setting up a way to play all of my favorite games from 20+ years ago. Using original hardware, the best way to do this is using  OPL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Open PS2 Loader&lt;/b&gt;, or OPL, is an interface installed on a PS2 memory card using Free McBoot OS. Through OPL, you can view all games you have installed on a USB drive, hard drive, or on a network share. After a bit of trial and error, I have a tons of a games on a 4tb hard drive hosted on a network share from a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have loaded this hard drive with every or any game I've ever remotely wanted to play, and the list has grown far greater than I imaged it would. To keep track of everything, I put all the entries in a database. And because OPL uses box art and metadata, I wanted an easy way to view it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I made another Game Inventory page, and this shows all of the Playstation 1 and Playstation 2 games currently stored on my hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/apps/ps2" title="http://theschlock.com/apps/ps2"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Playstation 2 Game Inventory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/apps/ps2" title="http://theschlock.com/apps/ps2"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240609_ps2_inv/IMG_2524_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240609_ps2_inv/IMG_2524_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/240609_ps2_inv/IMG_2524_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/playstation-2-game-inventory</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/playstation-2-game-inventory</link><category>Games</category><category>Internet</category><category>Projects</category><category>Programming</category><category>Local</category></item><item><title>Twin Arch 138</title><description>&lt;p&gt;The Twin Arch is one of the most recognizable landmarks from the highway leading out of Gifu in the south. It was one of the first things I noticed after arriving in Gifu for the first time eleven years ago, and after all this time, I finally went there to see it in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5110.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5110.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5110_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5110_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5110_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always associate the arches with South Gifu, but technically, they're in northern Aichi, just on the other side of the Kiso river that separates the two prefectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brought my Gameboy Camera along with to take some photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="gbcameraColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="columnOne"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5150.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5150.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5150_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5150_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5150_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnTwo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_204930_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_204930_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_204930_stitch.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twin Arch is at the front of a long beautiful park with flower fields and walking trails through the forest. In January, they have a marathons that runs through the trails of the park. There's an auditorium, too, which was being used for a musical festival when I arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, the true treasure of the park is the 360 degree view from the observation deck nearly 100 meters above ground. You have a clear view of southern Gifu to the north and northern Aichi to the south.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5177_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5177_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5177_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5177_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5177_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5212_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5212_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5212_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5212_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5212_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5168_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5168_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5168_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5168_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5168_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weather was absolutely perfect when I visited. Absolutely clear skies all around. You could see an incredible distance unobstructed by clouds or water vapor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nagoya was in clear view to the south. The lens on my Gameboy Camera was able to capture it nearly perfectly, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5254_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5254_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5254_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5254_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5254_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205155_stitch.png" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205155_stitch.png"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205155_stitch.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205155_stitch.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205155_stitch.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The camera sensor has about a 1-second refresh rate, so it's very difficult to get a significant amount of detail. There are only 4 colors, too, so that's also a problem.  But, as long as I'm able to prop the camera up against the glass or some solid surface, it's stable enough to take a photo without blur. Above is a stitched together image from 4 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Ontake and Mt. Norikura to the north were clearly visible, too. It's pretty amazing how far you're able to see when the weather is so clear.  Mt. Norikura is the eastern-most mountain in Takayama that borders Nagano. Takayama is about 80km north from the Twin Arch, and Norikura is about 50km directly east from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="gbcameraColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="columnOne"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5295_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="columnTwo"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205205.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mt. Ontake is the one bigger one on the right.  Mt. Norikura is on the left. It's pretty amazing that the GB Camera can get so much detail out of something that is over 60km away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Twin Arch is really the only landmark around the area, so you have an impressive view of suburbs after suburbs after suburbs. The view is amazing, especially on such a great day, but there isn't really a whole lot to see. There's the ferris wheel to the north next to the aquarium, but that's really the closest thing. Both Nagoya and Gifu City are so far away, you can't really get any detail other than the skyline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get some more detailed shots with both my regular camera and my GameBoy camera, so I shot a massive panoramic photo of the north with some detailed GB shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you find the &lt;b&gt;three&lt;/b&gt; locations of the GB shots in the panoramic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5258_stitch_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="threeColumns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205052.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205052.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205052.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205107.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205107.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205107.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column threeColumnLast"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205115.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205115.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/20231021_205115.webp" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love this GameBoy Camera so much. I'm using the GameBoy Camera Plus mod created by 2BitToy, which takes the inner circuits from a GameBoy Camera and puts them into a new shell with a CS Mount lens adapter. This allows you to use far more powerful lenses than the original. You can read about it here: &lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens" title="http://theschlock.com/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens"&gt;/pocket-camera-with-zoom-lens&lt;/a&gt; (April 13th, 2023). I'm using my Analogue Pocket to run it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in the observation deck is a small cafe. Its signature dish was called Honey Toast. As you can see from the photo below, it is a slice of very sweet toast topped with vanilla ice cream and whip cream, drizzled with chocolate syrup surrounded by almonds and sliced strawberries. It was an excellent breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;div class="columns"&gt;&lt;div class="column"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5282_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="column twoColumnLast"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/231022_arch/IMG_5296_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br class="clr" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it'd be great to visit in other seasons to see how everything changes. It'd also be great to visit during the summer to get a semi-aerial view of fireworks in the distance. Maybe also great to visit during a sunset. But, I kinda feel like this is a one-time visit kinda place.

The 2.0 update brings a complete rewrite of progression through leveling, equipment, and other systems. Graphics have been updated for modern consoles and PCs. And a new expansion adds a new story that expands the life of Night City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231008141136_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Night City is the setting of Cyberpunk, a sprawling multi-leveled metropolis. Depending on where you visit, it can be many things. It's a dark, dank, depressing slum festering with gangs, addicts, and trash. It's a futuristic neon haven vibrant with youth and life. It's a posh urban center of business and industry. It's a crime ridden war zone with constant shoot outs between cops and gangs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter where you go, the city is dense. Many citizens live in massive mega buildings that act as their own cities. Stores and other places of interest are often on different levels forcing you traverse Night City's maze of verticality. Streets and highways bend and elevate to different areas. The native GPS in the game is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprawling out from its dense centers, the outer edges of Night City has oil fields, solar collectors, and farm protected by greenhouses to sustain the massive amount of resources that fuel the city and its people. Small poor neighborhoods also grow on some pockets. Even further away are the badlands, a rocky desert where little grows and dust storms are common. There are also huge trash fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class='img'&gt;&lt;a href="http://theschlock.com/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714.jpg" title="http://theschlock.com/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" loading="lazy" alt="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" title="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dyreschlock/dyreschlock.github.photos/master/photo/cyberpunk/Cyberpunk_2077_20231009115714_t.webp" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyberpunk depicts a future where many of us think we're headed. Urban centers continue to collect more and more people, and the surrounding environment is ravaged of its resources to sustain them. Singular corporations rule the city and retain most of the wealth, which bleeds its citizens of their lives and dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the story begins as you play as V.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- - - - -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new update, I started a new character to see what the game now has to offer, and it's keeping my attention much more than before. I've been streaming it here and there, and taking plenty of photos along the way. I'll keep adding more photos as I continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I'll start up the DLC, too.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Oct 2023 12:00:00 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://theschlock.com/cyberpunk-2077</guid><link>https://theschlock.com/cyberpunk-2077</link><category>Games</category><category>Game Specific</category></item></channel></rss>
